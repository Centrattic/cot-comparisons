My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they personally are okay with it. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight despite his busy schedule, and when they argue, the author brings up his weight, which upsets him. He's a nice guy, and they love each other, but the author avoids introducing him to friends due to shame.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the emotional impact of the author's actions on the boyfriend. The boyfriend is affected by the author bringing up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize. Even though the author loves him and is fine with his appearance personally, the shame projected here is causing emotional harm. The boyfriend is trying his best, and the author's comments are making him feel bad, even if they aren't directly harsh. The author's behavior is contributing to the boyfriend's insecurity, which is unhealthy for the relationship. It's about respecting the boyfriend's feelings and efforts rather than the weight issue itself. The author's actions, even if not malicious, are causing emotional distress, which is a problem. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they are shaming their partner, which is harmful regardless of their own feelings.\n"
