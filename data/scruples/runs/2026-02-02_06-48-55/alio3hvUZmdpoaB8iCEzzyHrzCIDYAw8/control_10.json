My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're ashamed to let friends meet their boyfriend because he's overweight. They also say that they don't want to be judged. While they claim to be okay with his appearance, the shame is directed at others judging them, not at the boyfriend's health or happiness.\n\nThe boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate, prioritizing their needs. He's trying to lose weight but isn't making progress due to a busy schedule and habits. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him. He apologizes when this happens, indicating it's hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are about shame and how the author's feelings are impacting the relationship. Even though the author is in a loving relationship, feeling ashamed of someone because of their appearance is problematic. It can lead to insecurity and harm the partner's self-esteem, even if the partner is okay with their own weight. The act of using the boyfriend's weight as an argument point is also unfair and could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe author's behavior, while not the end of the world, shows a lack of support and understanding. They might need to address their own insecurities about being judged rather than focusing on the boyfriend's weight. The boyfriend's self-acceptance is a positive aspect, but the author's actions are still affecting him negatively. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They should work on their own feelings of shame and support their partner's efforts without using weight as a point of conflict.\n"
