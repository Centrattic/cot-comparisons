My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a girlfriend feeling ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and not wanting her friends to meet him. She says she's fine with how he looks but avoids her friends meeting him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress, and during arguments, she brings up his weight, which affects him and makes him apologize. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is body image and how the author is treating her partner. Even though she claims to be okay with his looks, her actions (avoiding friends meeting him) suggest otherwise. Feeling ashamed of someone because of their appearance is a form of shaming, which is not healthy in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health, which is commendable, but the author is still treating his weight as a problem. By using his weight as an argument point during fights, she's contributing to his insecurity. That's not supportive. Even if she doesn't intend to hurt him, consistently bringing it up can be harmful. \n\nHealthy relationships should be about mutual respect and support. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes after these arguments shows that he feels his weight is a problem, which might not be his own perception but influenced by her behavior. The author's shame is affecting his self-esteem, which is definitely wrong. \n\nAlso, the author is in good shape, which might influence her perspective, but that doesn't justify her actions. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect regardless of their size. The fact that she's ashamed of him for his weight, even if she claims to be okay with it, is a contradiction. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is in the wrong because her actions are contributing to her partner's low self-esteem and potentially damaging their relationship. She should address her own feelings of shame instead of projecting them onto her boyfriend. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight should be encouraged without pressure, especially from a partner. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
