My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if they're at fault for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. They've been together over a year, and the boyfriend is described as sweet and caring. The user is in good shape, and while they accept his weight, they avoid friends meeting him because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but isn't making much progress due to his schedule. The user sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's shame is about their own feelings regarding their friends' potential judgment, which is a personal issue. However, bringing up the boyfriend's weight during arguments might be using his appearance as a weapon, which is hurtful. Even if they don't hate him, making him apologize for his body could be emotionally damaging. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, which shows he cares about their relationship, but the user's approach might not be supportive. Instead of respecting his efforts without pressure, they're contributing to his insecurity. It's possible the user's shame is leading to unhealthy communication patterns. The key points are the emotional impact on the boyfriend and the user's responsibility in how they handle their own insecurities. So, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong because their actions are causing harm despite their acceptance of his weight.\n"
