My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that she's okay with her boyfriend's weight but avoids her friends seeing him because she's ashamed. That seems contradictory. If she's okay with him, why the shame around others? Maybe she's worried about societal judgment or her own insecurities. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, is happy with his appearance but is trying to lose weight despite the author bringing it up during arguments. He's making efforts, even though progress is slow due to his busy schedule. \n\nNow, the key points here are the author's behavior. She's making him feel bad enough that he apologizes during their arguments. That's a red flag. If someone is apologizing for their body, it's often because they're being made to feel inadequate. The author's shame is affecting his self-esteem and their relationship dynamics. \n\nEven though she loves him and says she's fine with his looks, her actions (avoiding friends and bringing it up in arguments) are harmful. Shame is a powerful emotion, and it's not just about her feelings; it's about how her words and actions impact his well-being. The boyfriend's efforts to improve suggest he cares about her, but the root issue is her own embarrassment, which isn't fair to him.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Yes, because her behavior is causing emotional distress and is based on her own insecurity rather than any issue with her boyfriend. The answer should be A.\n"
