My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their overweight boyfriend and not wanting friends to meet him, even though they acknowledge he's a good person and supportive.\n\nFirst, the author admits they're okay with their boyfriend's weight but feel ashamed around friends. That shame is leading them to avoid social situations and sometimes bring up the weight issue during arguments. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but struggling due to a busy schedule. He's affected by the comments and apologetically responds.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics and social norms. Feeling ashamed of someone else's appearance isn't uncommon, but acting on that shame in a way that harms the relationship or the other person is problematic. The author is using their own discomfort as a reason to control the situation, which might not be fair. Even though the boyfriend is trying to improve, the fact that the author brings it up during arguments suggests that their behavior could be contributing to his emotional distress. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respect and acceptance in a relationship. While personal feelings can't be controlled, how one acts on those feelings should consider the other person's feelings. The boyfriend's efforts to change his habits might be a sign he's trying to meet the author's expectations, which could lead to resentment if it's not about his own health goals.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's shame-driven behavior affecting the boyfriend's self-esteem and the potential for toxic dynamics even if the author isn't malicious. The answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong, because their actions are based on shame and could be harming the relationship despite their positive feelings towards their partner.\n"
