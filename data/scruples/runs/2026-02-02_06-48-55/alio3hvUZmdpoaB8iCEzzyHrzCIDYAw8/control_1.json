My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend feeling ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and avoiding introducing him to her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend is described as sweet and selfless, prioritizing the author's well-being. The author is okay with his looks but feels ashamed around friends. She's discussed this with him, and he's trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him, and he apologizes. She loves him and considers him the nicest guy she's met.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed and making her boyfriend feel bad about his weight. From a moral standpoint, feeling ashamed of someone else's appearance is problematic. It implies a judgment that can be harmful to their self-esteem, even if the person is okay with themselves. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's trying to address the issue, but the author's actions are contributing to his emotional distress. \n\nEven though the author says she's fine with his looks, her behavior (avoiding friends and using his weight as a point of argument) suggests otherwise. This can be hurtful and may not be fair. The fact that he apologizes when it comes up in arguments indicates that he feels guilty or bad about it, which the author's comments are causing. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without making the other feel ashamed of who they are. While body image issues are common, using them as a point of contention in arguments and avoiding social situations because of someone's appearance can be damaging. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing her own feelings over her boyfriend's well-being, which could be considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because her behavior is causing emotional harm to her partner, even if her intentions aren't malicious.\n"
