My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. They mention that he's sweet, prioritize their well-being, and is trying to lose weight. But they avoid introducing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. Also, when they argue, they bring up his weight, which affects him and makes him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if being ashamed is inherently wrong. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's self-aware and trying to improve. The author is okay with his appearance but still feels ashamed around friends. That's a personal feeling, but acting on it by not introducing him and bringing it up during arguments might be problematic.\n\nShaming someone for their weight, even if it's not directly stated, can be harmful. The boyfriend being affected and apologizing suggests that the author's comments during arguments are making him feel bad about himself. It's important to consider if this is contributing to his self-esteem or creating a negative environment. Even if the author isn't explicitly cruel, using someone's body as a topic during arguments can be a form of using their insecurities against them. \n\nAlso, the author's desire to avoid judgment from friends is understandable, but it's a choice that affects her boyfriend. It might be that she's projecting her own fears onto the relationship. Since the boyfriend is making efforts, maybe the author's shame isn't justified. The fact that he's affected by it means she's impacting his emotional state. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other. While she loves him and he's nice, her actions (not introducing him, using weight in arguments) could be seen as not fully supporting him. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. She should address her own feelings of shame and perhaps seek a more supportive approach rather than using his weight as a point of contention.\n"
