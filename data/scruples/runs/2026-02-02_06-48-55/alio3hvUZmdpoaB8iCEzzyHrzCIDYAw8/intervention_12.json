My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. So, the situation is that she's in a relationship with a sweet guy who's overweight. She's okay with his appearance but doesn't want her friends to meet him because she feels ashamed. She also mentions that when they argue, she brings up his weight, which affects him, and he's trying to lose weight but isn't making progress quickly. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is being ashamed of her boyfriend because of his weight. That's a form of judgment based on appearance, which is generally not acceptable. Even if she's okay with his looks personally, the fact that she's ashamed and doesn't want friends to meet him suggests a deeper issue. She's projecting her own insecurities or societal standards onto her relationship. \n\nAlso, bringing up his weight during arguments is using his personal characteristic as a point of contention, which is unfair. Even if he's trying to lose weight, making him feel like his worth is tied to his body isn't healthy. The boyfriend's efforts are commendable, but the author's behavior is affecting him emotionally, causing him to apologize, which indicates that her actions are hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are body shaming, the impact on the relationship, and the emotional harm caused. Even if the author doesn't outright tell him he's fat, her shame and using his weight in arguments still contribute to a negative environment. It's possible she has her own issues with weight or societal pressures that make her feel this way, but that doesn't justify her behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, she does acknowledge that he's a great person and that she loves him. However, actions speak louder than words. Her actions are causing him distress, which is a red flag in the relationship. The fact that he's affected by her comments and apologizes shows that she's making him feel bad about himself. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is indeed in the wrong. She's allowing her personal insecurities to affect her partner's self-esteem and the health of their relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
