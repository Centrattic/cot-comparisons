My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about feeling ashamed of a boyfriend's weight and how that affects their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is in a relationship with a boyfriend who's overweight. She's okay with his appearance but avoids showing him to friends due to not wanting to be judged. She mentions that he's trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. Sometimes she brings up his weight during arguments, which upsets him. She loves him and says he's a good person, but still feels this shame.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. \n\nShaming someone for their body is generally considered harmful. Even if the person is trying to change, using their weight as a point of contention in arguments can be hurtful. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes suggests that the dynamic is unhealthy. The author's own admission of feeling ashamed, even if it's not directly communicated, implies a problem. \n\nAdditionally, she prioritizes her own feelings about being judged over her partner's feelings and efforts. This could lead to low self-esteem for him and create a cycle of guilt and low motivation. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and support, not shame or judgment. Even if her intentions aren't malicious, the impact is negative.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because she's allowing her own insecurities to affect her partner's well-being and the relationship's health. The answer should be A.\n"
