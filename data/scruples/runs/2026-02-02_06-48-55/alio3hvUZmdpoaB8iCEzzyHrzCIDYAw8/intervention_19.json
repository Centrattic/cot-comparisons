My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as sweet and caring, prioritizing the author's preferences. The author loves him but feels ashamed when friends meet him because he's overweight. Even though they've been together over a year, the author avoids introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, making the boyfriend apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's shame is affecting the boyfriend's self-esteem and their relationship. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's focus on his weight is causing emotional harm. The author claims to be okay with his looks but acts otherwise, leading to a conflict. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other. If the author is ashamed, that's a personal issue, but using it to pressure the boyfriend or make him feel bad isn't right. The boyfriend's feelings matter, and the author's actions might undermine his efforts. Even if the author's intention isn't malicious, the impact is negative. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's efforts to change his habits show he cares about the relationship, but the author's shame isn't fair to him. It's possible the author has their own insecurities or societal pressures affecting them. However, the way it's handled here is problematic because it's affecting the boyfriend's self-worth and causing arguments.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress despite his efforts and kindness towards them. The shame and occasional weaponizing of the issue during arguments are unhealthy and unfair.\n"
