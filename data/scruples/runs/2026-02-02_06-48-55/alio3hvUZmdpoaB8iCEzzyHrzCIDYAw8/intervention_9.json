      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend because he's overweight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together over a year. The boyfriend is described as sweet, prioritizes her well-being. The author is in good shape, and while she's okay with his weight, she avoids her friends meeting him because she feels ashamed. She's discussed this with him, and he's trying to lose weight but making slow progress. When they argue, she brings up his weight as a point, which affects him, and he apologizes. She loves him and thinks he's great, but she feels ashamed when friends see him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image, self-esteem, and how one's feelings affect their partner. The author is ashamed of her boyfriend's weight, even though she's okay with it herself. She's causing him to feel like he needs to apologize for his body, which is his own. Even though he's trying to lose weight, the fact that she brings up his weight during arguments suggests that she's holding him to a standard that might not be healthy or fair.\n\nShame and body image issues can really hurt relationships. When someone feels ashamed of their partner's body, it can lead to the partner developing low self-esteem or even eating disorders. The boyfriend is already affected by it, which is a red flag. The author might be projecting her own insecurities or societal pressures onto her relationship. Even if she's not directly bullying him, her behavior is still contributing to his emotional distress.\n\nMoreover, the boyfriend is making an effort, but the author's focus on his weight might be counterproductive. It's possible that her shame isn't about his health but about her own discomfort with societal expectations. The fact that she avoids friends meeting him because of his weight shows that her feelings are impacting their relationship's social aspects, which isn't fair to him.\n\nSo, even though the author loves him and he's a nice guy, her being ashamed of his body is wrong. It's about respecting his autonomy and accepting him as he is. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
