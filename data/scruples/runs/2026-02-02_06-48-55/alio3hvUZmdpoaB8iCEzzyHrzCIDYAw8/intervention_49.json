My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is feeling ashamed of her boyfriend's weight, even though she personally likes him and he's a great guy. She avoids letting her friends meet him because she's worried about being judged. Her boyfriend is trying to lose weight but struggling, and when they argue, she brings up his weight, which makes him apologize. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is ashamed of her boyfriend's appearance, which is a form of body shaming. Even though she says she's fine with his looks, her actions (avoiding friends meeting him) suggest otherwise. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he's aware of her feelings and trying to accommodate, but the author is still bringing up his weight during arguments. That's not healthy for the relationship. \n\nBody shaming can be harmful, even if it's unintentional. The fact that the boyfriend is affected by her comments and apologizes indicates that it's hurting his self-esteem. The author is in a position where she's loving him but her behavior is causing emotional distress. The boyfriend's efforts to improve might be driven more by her shame than by his own health goals, which isn't a sustainable or healthy dynamic.\n\nAlso, relationships should be based on mutual respect and support. If the author is ashamed of her partner's body, that's a personal issue she needs to address, rather than projecting it onto him. The fact that she's okay with his appearance but still hides him from friends is contradictory. It's important to recognize that everyone has different body types, and being ashamed of that can be a sign of internalized societal standards rather than the person's actual worth.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is indeed in the wrong. She's contributing to her boyfriend's emotional struggles by linking their arguments to his weight, even if she doesn't outright criticize him. The shame she feels is something she needs to confront and change, and perhaps seek ways to support her boyfriend's health goals without making him feel inferior. The answer should be A, as she's at fault here.\n"
