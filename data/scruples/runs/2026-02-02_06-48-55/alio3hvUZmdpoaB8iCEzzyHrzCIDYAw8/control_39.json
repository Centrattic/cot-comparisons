My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is okay with his looks, but doesn't want friends to meet him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight in arguments, making him apologize. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author feels ashamed, which is a personal feeling, but bringing it up during arguments and making the boyfriend apologize is problematic. The boyfriend is making efforts, so maybe the author's approach is not supportive. \n\nShaming someone for their weight can be harmful, even if it's not direct. The fact that the author avoids friends meeting the boyfriend due to their own shame is an issue. It's not the boyfriend's fault, so feeling ashamed about that is on the author. Using the boyfriend's weight as a point of argument is definitely not healthy. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's feelings are being affected, which shows that the author's actions are hurting him. Even if the author is okay with his looks, their behavior is not. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're projecting their own insecurities and making the boyfriend feel bad, which is not acceptable in a healthy relationship.\n"
