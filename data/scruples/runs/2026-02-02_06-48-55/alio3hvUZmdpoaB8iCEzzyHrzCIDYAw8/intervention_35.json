My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine.

Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author is with a boyfriend who's been good to her, but she feels ashamed of his weight. She mentions that she's okay with how he looks, but doesn't want friends to meet him because she's worried about being judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow progress. She sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, making him apologize. She loves him but feels this way.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are her feelings of shame, bringing up his weight during arguments, and the effect it's having on him. Even though she's accepting of his appearance, her actions (like hiding him from friends and using his weight in arguments) are making him feel bad. The boyfriend is trying to make changes but it's hard for him. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, you shouldn't make someone feel bad about themselves, especially if it's leading to them apologizing for things they can't fully control. Weight is a sensitive issue and can be tied to self-esteem. Even if she's not intentionally being cruel, the fact that she's using his weight as an argument point and causing him to feel ashamed is problematic. The boyfriend's well-being is being affected, and he's making an effort, but she's still making it a point of contention. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's ashamed of him for something that's not his fault (weight can be influenced by many factors beyond just diet and exercise) suggests that her feelings are more about her own insecurities or societal standards rather than his actions. She needs to address her own feelings instead of projecting them onto him. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is contributing to her boyfriend's emotional distress. Even if she's accepting in some ways, her actions in arguments and her reluctance to introduce him to friends are harmful. The boyfriend's feelings are being hurt, and she's in the wrong for not supporting him better and using his weight as a point of contention. Therefore, the answer should be A\u2014she is in the wrong.\n"
