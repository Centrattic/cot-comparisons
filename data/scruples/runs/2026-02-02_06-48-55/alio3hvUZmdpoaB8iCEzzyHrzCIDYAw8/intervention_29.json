My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend for being overweight. The author mentions that they're fine with his looks but don't want friends to meet him. They also bring up weight as an argument point, which affects him.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the shame and the way it's affecting their relationship. The boyfriend is already making efforts to lose weight, which suggests the author's comments are influencing him. But he's making slow progress because of his schedule and habits, and the author turns it into an argument point. That's probably not healthy. \n\nShaming someone about their weight can be really hurtful, even if it's not direct. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or fear of judgment onto their boyfriend. The fact that he apologizes instantly shows he feels guilty or ashamed, which the author's behavior is contributing to. \n\nEven though the author says they're fine with his appearance, the underlying issue is the social anxiety about friends seeing him. That's their own problem, but using it as a reason to avoid others and bringing it up during arguments isn't fair to him. It's important to respect someone's body and not make them feel like they're not good enough, even indirectly. \n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's behavior might be pressuring him without proper support. The arguments likely create a toxic dynamic where he feels he has to apologize for something that's not his fault. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're causing emotional distress through shaming, even if unintentionally. They need to address their own feelings and communicate more supportively instead of using his weight as a point of contention.\n"
