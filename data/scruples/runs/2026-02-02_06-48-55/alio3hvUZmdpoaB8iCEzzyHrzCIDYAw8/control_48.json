My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine.

Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their overweight boyfriend and causing him to feel bad during arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is okay with their boyfriend's weight in private but avoids him around friends because they're ashamed. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress due to his schedule and habits. When they argue, the author brings up his weight, which upsets him, and he apologizes. The author loves him and thinks he's sweet, but the issue is the shame and its impact on the relationship.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is whether it's right to feel ashamed of a partner's appearance and use it as a point of contention in arguments. The boyfriend is clearly affected emotionally, which is a red flag. Even though the author isn't directly criticizing his weight beyond being ashamed, the fact that they use it as an argument point and cause him to apologize suggests that they are contributing to his low self-esteem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's well-being without judgment. The author might have good intentions by discussing weight, but the way it's handled is harmful. The boyfriend is making efforts, so the author's approach might not be encouraging. Also, avoiding friends meeting him because of shame is a clear sign of insecurity and could be seen as devaluing him in front of others. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards AITA (Am I the Asshole). The author is making their partner feel bad about himself, even if they think they're doing it for his benefit. The emotional impact on the boyfriend is significant, which is a key factor in determining fault.\n\nSo, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong because they're causing emotional distress to their partner and being ashamed is a form of judgment that's negatively affecting the relationship.\n"
