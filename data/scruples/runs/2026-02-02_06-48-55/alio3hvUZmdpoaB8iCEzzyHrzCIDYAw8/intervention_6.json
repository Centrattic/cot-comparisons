My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend is overweight, but the author is okay with his appearance. However, they feel ashamed when friends see him, so they avoid introducing him. They also bring up his weight during arguments, which affects him and leads to apologies. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight despite a busy schedule.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's accurate.\n\nShaming someone for their weight can be hurtful, even if the person is making efforts. The key points here are: the author avoids friends meeting the boyfriend due to shame, brings up weight in arguments, and the boyfriend is affected emotionally. The author loves him but feels this way, which might indicate underlying issues like insecurity or societal pressures.\n\nWhile the author isn't outright abusive, the fact that they feel ashamed and use his weight as an argument point contributes to his emotional distress. The boyfriend's efforts to improve show he's trying, yet the author's behavior undermines his self-esteem.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's well-being without judgment. The author's shame, even if not malicious, is a form of judgment that can be harmful. The fact that the author discusses it with the boyfriend multiple times suggests they're aware of the issue but still hold onto feelings of shame.\n\nSo, despite the boyfriend's understanding, the author's actions (avoiding friends, using weight as an argument point) are problematic. They are in the wrong because they're projecting their insecurities onto their partner, which isn't fair or healthy for the relationship.\n"
