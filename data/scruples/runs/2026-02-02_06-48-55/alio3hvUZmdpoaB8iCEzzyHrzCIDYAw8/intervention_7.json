My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, and the author avoids introducing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which upsets the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is ashamed of their partner's appearance, which is a personal feeling, but the way they act on it might be problematic. Avoiding friends seeing the boyfriend because of shame is a social issue. Also, using the boyfriend's weight as an argument point during conflicts is emotional and could be harmful.\n\nThe boyfriend is described as sweet and making efforts to lose weight, but the author's behavior is affecting his emotional well-being. The author's actions might be contributing to the boyfriend's stress or insecurity, even if the author doesn't intend to be cruel. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes after arguments suggests he's hurt by the author's remarks.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's feelings. While the author isn't forcing the boyfriend to change, the shame and conditional acceptance (only when around friends) can be seen as judgmental. The boyfriend's efforts to change his habits are commendable, but the author's role in this dynamic might be unhealthy. The author's shame is personal, but acting on it in a way that affects the boyfriend's self-esteem is where the issue lies.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong. They're projecting their insecurities onto the relationship and affecting the boyfriend's emotional state, even if unintentionally.\n"
