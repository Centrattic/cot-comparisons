My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate, which is a good sign. The author says they're fine with his looks but don't want friends to see him, leading to shame. They also mention bringing up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nThe key points here are the author's shame and the impact on the boyfriend. Even if the author is okay with his weight, the shame aspect is problematic. Making someone feel bad about their body, especially when it's part of arguments, can be hurtful. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but struggling, so the author's criticism might be adding pressure without being supportive.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's feelings are being hurt when the author uses his weight as an argument point. That suggests the author isn't handling the situation well. While it's one thing to want to improve, it's another to make the partner feel ashamed. The author's behavior might be contributing to the boyfriend's stress rather than helping.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's goals. If the author is concerned about their own feelings around friends, maybe they should address their own insecurities instead of making the boyfriend feel bad. So, the author is likely in the wrong here because their actions are causing emotional harm.\n"
