My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but isn't making much progress due to a busy schedule and habits. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, making the boyfriend feel bad even though he's okay with his appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Feeling ashamed of someone for their appearance is a form of body shaming, which is generally considered unacceptable. Even if the author is okay with the boyfriend's weight, the fact that they feel ashamed and want to hide him from friends is problematic. It's about treating the boyfriend as if his appearance is something to be embarrassed about, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to change, but the author is using it as a point in arguments. That could be manipulating his insecurities rather than supporting him. Even if the author claims to love him, causing emotional harm through shaming and using it as a weapon in arguments isn't healthy. It's important to respect a partner's autonomy and their comfort with their body unless there are health concerns, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's effort to lose weight suggests he might be affected by the author's comments, even if he says he's okay with his looks. That could indicate that the author's behavior is contributing to his self-esteem issues or body image problems, which is not fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions they love him and he's a good person. But feelings of shame and body shaming are still harmful regardless of other positive aspects. The key here is whether the author's actions are wrong. Since they are making the boyfriend feel bad about himself and hiding him from friends, that's definitely in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
