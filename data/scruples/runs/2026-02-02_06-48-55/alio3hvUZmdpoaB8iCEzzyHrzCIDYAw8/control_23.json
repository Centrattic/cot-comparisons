My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine.

Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is in good shape, and they've been together over a year. The author is okay with his looks but avoids friends meeting him to avoid judgment. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow due to his schedule. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author seems to care for their boyfriend, acknowledging his sweetness and efforts. However, the shame they feel is affecting their relationship. The boyfriend is trying to improve his health, which shows he's responsive, but the author's bringing up the issue during arguments is causing him distress. Even if the author is fine with his weight, the fact that they avoid friends meeting him due to shame is problematic. It's one thing to want to support each other, but feeling ashamed can lead to negative self-esteem for the boyfriend and could damage the relationship's foundation.\n\nAlso, body image issues in relationships often lead to unhealthy dynamics. The author's actions might be unintentionally pressuring the boyfriend, which could be why he apologizes instantly. Even if the author isn't being cruel, the emotional impact is there. The key point is that everyone deserves to be loved and accepted for who they are, including their body. Feeling ashamed of someone for their weight is a form of body shaming, which is generally considered wrong. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their feelings of shame are causing harm, even if they aren't overtly abusive. The answer should be A.\n"
