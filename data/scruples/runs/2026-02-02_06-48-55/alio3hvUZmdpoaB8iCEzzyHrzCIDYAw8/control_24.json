My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The author mentions that their boyfriend is sweet and makes efforts to lose weight, but the author avoids introducing him to friends due to shame. They also bring up the weight issue during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is embarrassed by their partner's weight, even though they say they're okay with it. They don't want friends to meet him because of that. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's hard because of his schedule. The author uses his weight as an argument point, which makes him apologize. They love him and say he's the nicest guy they've met. \n\nNow, thinking about societal standards and relationships. Being ashamed of someone's body can be problematic because it's about their self-worth. The boyfriend's efforts to improve show he cares, but the author's comments during arguments might be hurtful. Even if the author isn't outwardly cruel, using weight as a point in arguments can be damaging. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes suggests that the author's words are hurting him. \n\nAlso, the author is avoiding friends meeting their partner because of his weight. That's a sign of internalized shame or insecurity, which isn't right. Healthy relationships should involve acceptance and support. The author might have good intentions by encouraging weight loss, but the way they're approaching it (using it as an argument point and avoiding social situations) is harmful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions are contributing to the boyfriend's emotional state. Even if the boyfriend is okay with his weight, the author's behavior is making him feel he needs to change for them. That's not fair. The author should address their own feelings of shame and find a way to support their partner without making them feel inadequate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They need to work on their own insecurities and find healthier ways to support their partner without using weight as a point of contention.\n"
