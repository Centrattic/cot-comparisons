My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but is making slow progress. The author also mentions bringing up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author claims they're okay with his weight but feel ashamed for friends to see him. That seems contradictory. The boyfriend is making an effort, but the author uses his weight as an argument point, which can be hurtful. Even if the author loves him, shame and using someone's appearance as a point of contention in arguments is problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend is affected by this, which shows it's impacting their relationship negatively. The author's behavior might be causing emotional harm, which is a red flag. Even if the boyfriend is okay with his weight, the author's actions are making him feel insecure. The author's shame isn't just their own feeling; it's affecting the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's well-being without making them feel ashamed. The author is prioritizing their own comfort over their partner's self-esteem. Even if they think they're being kind, the way they handle it is harmful. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes after arguments about his weight suggests he's internalizing the criticism. \n\nSo, the answer is likely AITA A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The shame and using weight as an argument are harmful, regardless of the author's intentions. The solution would be to address their own feelings of shame and find healthier ways to support their partner's goals without making them feel bad.\n"
