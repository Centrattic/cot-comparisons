My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they say they're fine with it. The author avoids friends meeting the boyfriend because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but struggling, and the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which hurts him.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the feeling of shame and the judgment towards the boyfriend's weight. Even if the author claims to be okay with his weight, their actions (avoiding friends meeting him, using weight as an argument point) suggest otherwise. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's behavior might be undermining his confidence and efforts.\n\nI need to consider the emotional impact. The boyfriend is affected by the comments and apologizes, which shows that the author's words are hurting him. Even if it's not intentional, it's still harmful. The author's shame could be contributing to his low self-esteem, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is in good shape and the boyfriend is overweight might be a double standard. The author's focus on their own image versus their partner's could be an issue. The boyfriend prioritizes the author's well-being, but the author isn't reciprocating in terms of support for his self-esteem or health journey.\n\nSo, even if the author loves him and he's a nice guy, the behavior of avoiding friends and bringing up weight in arguments is problematic. It's about respecting the partner's feelings and not letting personal insecurities or societal judgment affect the relationship negatively. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions and words are causing harm despite their claims of being okay with it.\n"
