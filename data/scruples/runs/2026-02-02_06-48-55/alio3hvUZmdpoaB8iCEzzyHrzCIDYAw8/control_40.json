My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as sweet and prioritizes the author's well-being. He's trying to lose weight but it's slow because of his busy schedule and habits. The author is okay with his appearance but avoids friends meeting him because she feels ashamed. She also uses his weight as a point in arguments, which makes him apologize.\n\nThe key issue here is the author's feelings of shame. Even though she's fine with his looks, the shame is causing her to avoid social interactions and contribute to arguments. That's not healthy for the relationship. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's trying to address her concerns, but the author's behavior is affecting him emotionally. \n\nBeing ashamed of someone because of their weight can be a form of judgment that's harmful. It's possible she's projecting her own insecurities or societal pressures onto the relationship. The fact that she brings up his weight during arguments and he feels the need to apologize suggests that her comments are hurtful and not supportive. \n\nEven though she loves him and he's a good person, her actions are causing emotional distress. The boyfriend's slow progress in weight loss is due to external factors, not laziness, so the author's focus on that might not be fair. She might need to work on her own feelings of shame and find healthier ways to communicate if there are genuine concerns about health, rather than using it as a point of contention. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her shame and using his weight as an argument point are negatively impacting the relationship and his self-esteem.\n"
