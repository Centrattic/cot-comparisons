My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The scenario describes a relationship where the boyfriend is overweight, and the author feels uncomfortable introducing him to friends, even though they love him and he's a good person. The author also mentions that they sometimes bring up the boyfriend's weight during arguments, which affects him negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is ashamed of their partner's appearance, which leads them to avoid introducing him to friends. That's a form of embarrassment or shame, which can be harmful. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health, but progress is slow. The key point is whether the author's actions are wrong.\n\nShaming someone about their body, even if it's not directly stated, can perpetuate negative self-image. The author admits they're fine with his looks but still feel ashamed. That contradiction might indicate an internal conflict. The boyfriend is affected by the arguments about his weight, which suggests that the author's words are impacting his self-esteem. Even if the author's intention isn't malicious, the consequence is harmful.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's well-being without judgment. The fact that the author brings up the boyfriend's weight during arguments and makes him apologize shows that the author is making the boyfriend feel guilty about his appearance. This can erode trust and self-worth in the boyfriend. The author's friends not seeing the boyfriend is a result of the author's discomfort, which might lead to social isolation for the boyfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author loves the boyfriend and acknowledges his positive qualities. They might be struggling with their own insecurities or societal pressures about body image. However, the responsibility lies with the author to address their own feelings rather than letting them affect the relationship negatively.\n\nIn terms of accountability, even if the author isn't overtly cruel, the underlying shame and using the boyfriend's weight as an argument point are problematic. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health should be encouraged without the pressure of the author's shame. The author needs to reflect on why they feel ashamed and work on their own biases or fears, rather than projecting them onto their partner.\n"
