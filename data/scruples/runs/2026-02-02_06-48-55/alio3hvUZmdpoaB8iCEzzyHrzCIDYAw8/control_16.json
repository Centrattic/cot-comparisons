My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's ashamed and avoids showing her boyfriend to her friends. Even though she says she's fine with his appearance, the shame is causing issues. She also brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize. That's a red flag because using someone's body as a point of contention in arguments is unhealthy.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author has discussed it with him, but pushing someone to change their body for your comfort might not be fair. The key here is that the shame is hers, not his. The boyfriend seems to accept himself, which is positive, but the author's behavior is affecting his emotions. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's well-being without making them feel inadequate. The fact that she brings up his weight during arguments shows it's a trigger for him, which isn't healthy. Even if her intentions aren't malicious, the impact is there. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (she's in the wrong) because she's allowing her own shame to affect her partner's self-esteem and their relationship dynamics. It's about respecting his body and not making him feel he needs to change for her validation, even if it's about her friends' opinions.\n"
