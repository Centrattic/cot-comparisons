My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation details that the boyfriend is sweet and does a lot for the author, but they feel ashamed to introduce him to friends because of his weight. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but has started trying to lose weight. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author's feelings of shame are personal, but they're affecting the relationship. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, which shows he cares about the author's feelings. However, the author is using the weight as an argument point, which can be hurtful even if it's not intentional. \n\nShame and judgment can be harmful in relationships. Even if the author is okay with his appearance, the fact that they feel ashamed to show him to friends might indicate deeper issues. It's important to respect someone's autonomy and body image. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are positive, but the author shouldn't be using his weight as a point of contention. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction to the argument points shows that the author's words are impacting him negatively. Even if the author loves him, the behavior of shaming during arguments isn't healthy. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and support. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is contributing to the boyfriend's distress by bringing up the weight issue during arguments. Even though the author might not mean to hurt him, the effect is there. The shame they feel isn't the boyfriend's fault, and the author needs to address their own feelings rather than project them onto their partner. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
