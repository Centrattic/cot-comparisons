My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong (AITA) for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's okay with her boyfriend's appearance but avoids showing him to her friends due to fear of judgment. She also says that when they argue, she brings up his weight as a point, which makes him apologize. He's trying to lose weight but it's slow progress because of his schedule and habits.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: shame about his weight, using his appearance in arguments, and causing him emotional distress. Even though she loves him and he's sweet, the behavior of making him feel bad about his body could be harmful. Body shaming is generally considered unacceptable, especially in a relationship where one partner should support the other. She's making him feel ashamed and contributing to his anxiety about his weight. Even if she's not overtly cruel, the fact that she uses it as an argument point and he apologizes suggests she's in the wrong. The right thing to do would be to support his efforts and address her own feelings of shame without criticizing him. So the answer is A.\n"
