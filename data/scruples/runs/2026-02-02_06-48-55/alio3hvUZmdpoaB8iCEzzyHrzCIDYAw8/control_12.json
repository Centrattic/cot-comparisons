My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being ashamed of their overweight boyfriend and not wanting friends to meet him. They mention that they love him and he's sweet, but their shame is causing issues.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the criteria for AITA. Typically, it's about whether the person's actions or attitudes are unkind, unfair, or unethical. The key points here are the author's shame, the boyfriend's efforts to lose weight, and the author bringing up the issue during arguments.\n\nThe author is being honest about their feelings of shame. They don't outright reject the boyfriend but are hesitant to introduce him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to improve, which shows he's not resistant. However, the author is using the boyfriend's weight as a point in arguments, which could be hurtful. Even if the author is okay with the boyfriend's appearance, the shame and bringing it up during conflicts can be damaging. It's about respecting the boyfriend's feelings and not making him feel that his worth is tied to his weight. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes suggests that this is a sensitive topic. The author's actions, while not necessarily malicious, are contributing to the boyfriend's insecurity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're allowing their shame to affect the relationship negatively, even if unintentionally.\n"
