My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. The boyfriend is sweet and makes efforts to lose weight, but the author avoids showing him to friends out of shame. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are the feelings of shame, the boyfriend's efforts, and the impact on their relationship. The author admits they don't want friends to see their boyfriend because they don't want to be judged. That's a social issue but could lead to him feeling insecure. When the author brings up his weight during arguments, it's using his size as a point of contention, which can be hurtful even if they don't mean it to be. The boyfriend is making an effort, so maybe the author's criticism is undermining that. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes suggests that the author's words are hurting him. Even if the author isn't overtly cruel, making someone feel ashamed about their body in a relationship is generally considered harmful. It's about respect and acceptance. So, the author is likely in the wrong here because they're contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress and not being fully accepting of him as he is. The answer should be A.\n"
