Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged.

However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. They've been together over a year and mention he's sweet and prioritizes their well-being. The author is in good shape and is okay with his weight but doesn't want friends to see them together to avoid judgment. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to lose weight, though making slow progress. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him, and he apologizes. The author loves him and says he's the nicest guy they've met but feels ashamed when friends meet him.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author's issue is feeling ashamed of the boyfriend's weight. That's a form of body shaming, even if they don't realize it. They admit they avoid friends seeing the boyfriend to avoid judgment. That's a problem because it's not the boyfriend's fault. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve, but the author is still bringing up his weight during arguments. That's unfair because it's using his insecurities against him. Even if the author is supportive of his efforts, the fact that they feel ashamed and bring it up in arguments is hurtful. The boyfriend apologizing shows he's affected by it, which indicates that the author's behavior is causing emotional harm. \n\nEven if the author loves him, the fact that they feel ashamed is a problem. It's not right to make someone feel bad about their body, especially in a relationship. The boyfriend's efforts to change shouldn't be a point of contention, and using it as an argument point is not healthy. The key here is that the author's shame and judgment are negatively impacting the relationship and the boyfriend's self-esteem. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they are body-shaming the boyfriend and using it as an argument point, which is hurtful and wrong.\n"
