My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person asking is a woman in a relationship with a boyfriend who is overweight. She says she's fine with how he looks but feels ashamed when friends see him. She brings up his weight in arguments, and he's trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She's using her own feelings of shame as a reason to bring up his weight, which affects him emotionally. Even though she says she's okay with his appearance personally, her actions (avoiding friends meeting him, bringing up weight in arguments) are causing him distress. He's already making an effort to improve, but she's still making it a point of contention. That seems harsh because it's her discomfort that's the root issue, not his weight itself. \n\nAlso, relationships should be about mutual respect and support. If her shaming is causing him to apologize, that's not healthy. It's his body, and she shouldn't make him feel bad about it unless there's a health concern. But the problem here is her social anxiety about others' opinions, which is her own issue to handle. Pressuring him to change for her sake isn't right. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (she's in the wrong) because she's letting her own insecurities about societal judgment affect their relationship negatively, without considering his feelings and efforts.\n"
