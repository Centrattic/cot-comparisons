My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends, even though they love him. They occasionally bring up the weight issue during arguments, making the boyfriend apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and relationship dynamics. Feeling ashamed of someone for their weight can stem from personal insecurities or societal pressures. The boyfriend is trying to make changes, which shows he's self-aware and making an effort. However, the author is using his weight as a point in arguments, which can be harmful. Even if the author is okay with his appearance themselves, making him feel that his weight is a problem in the relationship can lead to low self-esteem and guilt.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's shame, the boyfriend's efforts to improve, the use of weight as a conflict point, and the emotional impact on the boyfriend. Even if the author's intentions aren't malicious, the behavior is affecting the boyfriend negatively. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and support. Body image issues can be sensitive, and criticizing someone's appearance, even if they're trying to change, can be hurtful. The author might need to work on their own insecurities and communicate more constructively instead of using the boyfriend's weight as a leverage in arguments. So, it seems like the author is in the wrong here.\n"
