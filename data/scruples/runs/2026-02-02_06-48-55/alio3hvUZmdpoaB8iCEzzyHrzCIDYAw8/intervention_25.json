My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The author mentions they love him and he's nice, but they don't want friends to meet him because they feel ashamed. They also bring up his weight during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, body image issues can be a sensitive topic. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but the author is still making him feel bad. Even if the author doesn't hate him, shaming someone for their weight can be harmful. Weight is a personal issue and not a valid basis for judgment. The fact that the author uses his weight in arguments and causes him to apologize shows that their comments are hurtful. The boyfriend is okay with his looks, so the author's shame isn't justified. The key point is that the author's actions are making the boyfriend feel bad about himself, which is wrong regardless of their intentions. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
