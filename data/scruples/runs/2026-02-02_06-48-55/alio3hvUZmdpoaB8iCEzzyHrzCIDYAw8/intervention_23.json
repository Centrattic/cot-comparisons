My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're okay with his appearance themselves but don't want their friends to meet him, which makes them feel ashamed. They also bring up his weight as an argument point, which affects him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress due to his schedule.\n\nSo, the main issues here are shame and using someone's appearance as a point of contention in arguments. Even if the author isn't directly bullying or being mean, feeling ashamed of someone's body can be hurtful. The boyfriend is already affected by it and apologizes, which shows he's hurt. The author loves him but their behavior might be contributing to his self-esteem issues.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is making efforts to improve, which shows he cares. The author's shame isn't just about themselves but could be impacting his mental health. Even if the author is fine with his looks, the fact that they're hiding him from friends suggests deeper issues, maybe their own insecurities or societal pressures.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other. Feeling ashamed and using that as an argument point isn't healthy. The author's actions, even if well-meaning, might be harmful. So, I think the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
