My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The author mentions that their boyfriend is sweet and makes efforts to lose weight, but they still feel ashamed and avoid introducing him to friends. They also bring up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: feeling ashamed of someone else's appearance. That's a personal feeling, but how it's acted upon matters. The author is in a relationship where they express shame, which can hurt the partner emotionally. Even if the boyfriend is okay with his own looks, the author's behavior might be undermining his efforts and self-esteem. \n\nThe boyfriend is making an effort to improve his health, which shows he cares about the relationship. The author bringing up his weight during arguments could be a way of using his appearance as a weapon in disagreements, which isn't healthy. It's important to recognize that body image issues are sensitive, and making someone feel ashamed can damage trust and self-worth.\n\nAlso, the author's fear of judgment from friends is a personal insecurity. Projecting that onto their partner isn't fair. The boyfriend might feel like he's not good enough if the author is hiding him. Even if the author is fine with his looks in private, the public aspect (friends) might make him feel devalued.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should support each other's well-being. While the author may not be physically harming their partner, emotionally, they are contributing to a negative environment. The boyfriend's efforts to change might be driven by a desire to please the author, which isn't sustainable if the author isn't addressing their own feelings.\n\nSo, even though the author has positive feelings towards their partner, the actions of shaming and using weight as an argument point are harmful. The answer would be AITA A (Yes).\n"
