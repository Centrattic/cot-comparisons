My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. The situation is that she's in a year-long relationship with a sweet boyfriend who takes care of her, but she's embarrassed for him because he's overweight. She doesn't want her friends to meet him, and even though he's making efforts to lose weight, he's not seeing progress quickly. She brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. The main issue here is her shame about his appearance, which is causing emotional distress. Even though she says she's okay with how he looks, her actions (not introducing him to friends, using weight as an argument point) are problematic. \n\nShame and body image are sensitive topics. The boyfriend is already making efforts to change, but the author is still making him feel bad. This could lead to low self-esteem for him, especially since he's apologizing after arguments. The fact that she's ashamed of him, even if she loves him, might indicate an underlying issue in the relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she's honest about her feelings and that he's aware and trying to improve. But the key here is the emotional impact. Making someone feel ashamed about their body in a romantic relationship can be considered harmful. The boyfriend's feelings are affected, which shows that her behavior is having a negative effect.\n\nAlso, the fact that she avoids introducing him to friends because of his weight is a sign of insecurity or judgment. Even if she's trying to be supportive, the way she's handling it is causing him distress. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight might be motivated by her comments, but if he's not making progress, the pressure is still on him, which isn't fair.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other unconditionally. While personal preferences exist, making someone feel ashamed for a characteristic they can't control immediately (like weight) is wrong. The author's actions are contributing to his emotional pain, which is a significant factor. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
