My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong (AITA) for being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. The situation is that they've been together over a year, the boyfriend is sweet and supportive, but the author feels ashamed when friends meet him, even though they're okay with his appearance themselves. They avoid showing him to friends, and sometimes use his weight as an argument point. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key points here are about body image, self-respect, and how the relationship is affected. The author admits to feeling ashamed, which is a negative emotion directed at their partner's weight. Even though they say they're okay with how he looks, their actions (avoiding friends, using his weight in arguments) indicate a problem.\n\nShaming someone for their weight can be harmful. The boyfriend is already making efforts to improve, but the author is using his weight as a point of contention during arguments, which isn't healthy. The fact that he apologizes after these arguments suggests he's hurt by it, which means the author's comments are having a negative impact.\n\nEven if the author doesn't overtly hate his weight, their shame and the way they handle conflicts related to it are problematic. It's important in a relationship to support each other's well-being without making them feel bad about themselves. The boyfriend's efforts to diet and exercise show he's trying to please the author, which shouldn't be a requirement for his self-worth.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is contributing to their partner's insecurity and potentially harming his self-esteem. The shame and using weight as an argument point are not right. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
