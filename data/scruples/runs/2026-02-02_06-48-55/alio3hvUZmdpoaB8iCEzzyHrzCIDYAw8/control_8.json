My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend because he's fat. The situation is that she likes him a lot, he's sweet and makes sacrifices for her, but she feels ashamed when her friends see him. She's brought up his weight as an argument point, and he's trying to lose weight but making slow progress. She says she's okay with his looks but doesn't want friends to meet him, which causes guilt for him when it's mentioned during arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if shame about a partner's appearance is inherently wrong. Society often stigmatizes weight issues, so there's a cultural aspect here. The key points are her actions: avoiding friends meeting him due to shame, bringing up weight in arguments, and him feeling affected. She also mentions he's trying to lose weight but it's hard for him.\n\nThe question is whether her behavior is in the wrong. Even if she's okay with him, the fact that she's ashamed and uses it as a point in arguments could be harmful. The boyfriend is affected by it, which indicates emotional impact. Being ashamed can be a sign of internalized bias or lack of support for his self-esteem. Even if she's trying to help him by encouraging weight loss, the way she brings it up during arguments might be a form of emotional manipulation or criticism that's hurtful.\n\nAdditionally, making him apologize when she's the one who brings it up shows that he's taking the blame, which isn't right. The fact that he's making efforts but not seeing progress might not be entirely his fault, considering his schedule and habits. Her shame might undermine his efforts and affect his self-worth.\n\nSo, even though she loves him, the act of being ashamed and using his weight as an argument point is likely hurtful and wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
