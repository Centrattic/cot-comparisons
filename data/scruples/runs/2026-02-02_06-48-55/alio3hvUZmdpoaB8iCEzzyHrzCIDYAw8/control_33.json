My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. They mention that he's sweet and tries to do things for them, but the author avoids showing him to friends because they're worried about being judged. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but is trying to lose it despite his busy schedule. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't directly saying they hate his weight, but they're ashamed and it's affecting how they interact with friends. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, but progress is slow. The author loves him but feels ashamed, which leads to using his weight as an argument point. \n\nShaming someone for their body is generally considered wrong because it's about appearance rather than character. The boyfriend is making an effort, which shows he's trying to please them, but the author is still using that as a point of contention. Even if the author isn't overtly cruel, the fact that they feel ashamed and use it in arguments could be hurtful. The boyfriend's reactions (apologizing instantly) suggest he feels bad about it. \n\nAlso, the author's friends not seeing him because they're ashamed is a social issue. The boyfriend's well-being is being prioritized over his own, which might indicate underlying insecurities or societal pressures on the author. The author might need to confront their own feelings about body image and how their actions affect their partner.\n\nSo, even though the author loves him, the shame and using his weight in arguments are problematic. The boyfriend's efforts are there, but the author's behavior is contributing to his stress. It's a matter of respect and how they treat each other's feelings. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
