My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The boyfriend is overweight, and the author avoids introducing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but is trying to lose it. The author sometimes uses his weight as an argument point, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's appearance, which is a personal feeling, but acting on that shame by avoiding friends and bringing it up during arguments is problematic. The boyfriend is making an effort to improve, but the author's behavior might be undermining his confidence. Even if the author is fine with his looks, the fact that they feel shame and pass that onto the boyfriend through arguments suggests that they are contributing to his insecurity. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014apologizing instantly\u2014shows that he's hurt by it. The author loves him but their actions are causing emotional harm. The core issue is about how the author is handling their own insecurities or societal pressures, which affects the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without letting personal insecurities affect the partner. Using someone's appearance as a point of conflict, even if it's about the author's feelings, is not healthy. The author is in the wrong because they are projecting their shame onto the boyfriend and making him feel like he's at fault for something that's not his responsibility to change for them. The answer should be A.\n"
