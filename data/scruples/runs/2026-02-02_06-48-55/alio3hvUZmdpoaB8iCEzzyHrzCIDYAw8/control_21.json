My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they personally are okay with it. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but isn't making much progress due to his schedule and habits. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend negatively, even though he's okay with his own appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author loves the boyfriend and acknowledges his positive traits. But the shame and the comments during arguments are causing emotional harm. Even if the author isn't directly saying something mean, the fact that they feel ashamed and project that onto their partner is problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to change, but the author's behavior might be contributing to his stress or lack of progress. Using his weight as an argument point is not healthy. It's about self-acceptance and respecting the partner's body. The author's desire to avoid judgment from friends is their own issue, but using that as a reason to make their partner feel bad is not right.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's feelings are being affected, which shows that the author's actions are causing emotional distress. Even if the author is in a good place with their own feelings, it's about how their partner feels. The key here is that the author is making their partner feel ashamed of himself, which is a form of emotional manipulation or pressure in the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They need to address their own insecurities about being seen with someone of a different body type and stop using the partner's weight as a point of conflict. The author should support the boyfriend's efforts without making it a source of shame during arguments.\n"
