My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend feeling ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and making it an argument point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is described as sweet, caring, and prioritizing her needs. He's also making an effort to lose weight, which shows he's trying. The author, however, is ashamed of his appearance, even though she says she's okay with his looks. She avoids letting friends see him because she doesn't want to be judged. This is a contradiction in her feelings\u2014she's fine with him but feels shame in social settings, which is affecting their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about respect, body image, and how one's insecurities can impact their partner. The author is making her boyfriend feel bad about himself by bringing up his weight during arguments. Even if she loves him, using his body as a point of contention in arguments is harmful. It's affecting his self-esteem because he's apologizing after arguments. That suggests he's internalizing her comments, which is not healthy for his self-image.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's making efforts to change, despite his busy schedule, shows he's trying to meet her expectations. But the author's shame is driving this, not necessarily his actions. The real issue here is her own feelings of shame rather than his weight itself. It's important to address her own insecurities about social judgment rather than making him feel like he's the problem.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other without causing emotional harm. The author's actions, even if unintentional, are contributing to her boyfriend's low self-esteem. The correct approach would be to address her own feelings of shame and work on self-acceptance, rather than projecting that onto her partner. So, yes, she's in the wrong for using his weight as a weapon in arguments and not supporting him despite her personal insecurities.\n"
