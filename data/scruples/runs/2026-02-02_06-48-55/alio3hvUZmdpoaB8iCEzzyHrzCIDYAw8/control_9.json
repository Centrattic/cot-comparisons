My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the post. The user loves their boyfriend, says he's sweet and prioritizes their well-being. They're okay with his appearance but feel ashamed when friends see him. They avoid introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow due to his schedule. The user sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nSo, the main issue is the shame and how that's impacting the relationship. Being ashamed of someone for their body can be a problem because it's about self-esteem and societal standards. Even if the user is okay with his weight in general, avoiding friends meeting him suggests deeper insecurity. Also, bringing up his weight during arguments is probably hurtful, even if the boyfriend is okay with it. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight might be a sign that the user's comments are affecting him more than he lets on.\n\nRelationships should be built on mutual respect and support. If one partner feels ashamed of the other's body, that could lead to long-term issues. The user's actions, even if not malicious, might be contributing to the boyfriend's self-esteem issues. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes instantly when the topic comes up suggests he's hurt by it.\n\nAlso, body image is a sensitive topic. Even if the user isn't overtly critical, avoiding social interactions because of someone's body can be damaging. The user might need to reflect on why they feel ashamed and whether they can support their partner better without making them feel insecure.\n\nIn the AITA context, typically, if someone is making another person feel bad about themselves, even if it's not direct, it's considered wrong. The user isn't physically harming the boyfriend, but the emotional impact is there. The boyfriend's efforts to change might be a result of the user's comments, which can be a form of subtle pressure.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is in the wrong because they're contributing to their boyfriend's insecurity and avoiding social situations due to his body, which isn't their partner's fault. The answer should be A.\n"
