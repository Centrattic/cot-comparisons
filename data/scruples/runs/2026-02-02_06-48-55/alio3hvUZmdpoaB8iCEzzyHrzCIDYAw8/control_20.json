My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend for being overweight. They mention that they love him and he's sweet, but they don't want their friends to meet him because of their own feelings of shame. The boyfriend is making an effort to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects him negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, which is a personal feeling but is affecting their relationship. Even though they say they're okay with his appearance, their actions (avoiding friends and using it as an argument point) suggest otherwise. The boyfriend is trying to address the issue, which shows he cares about her feelings. However, the author is making him feel guilty during conflicts, which is not healthy.\n\nShaming someone for their body isn't right, and even if the author isn't directly calling it out, their behavior (like avoiding friends) implies that they are. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes when it's brought up during arguments indicates that it's hurting him. The author's actions, while perhaps not intentional, are still contributing to the boyfriend's self-esteem issues. The boyfriend's efforts to change show he's trying to meet the author's expectations, which shouldn't be necessary if the author truly isn't ashamed. \n\nAlso, relationships should be built on mutual respect and support. Using someone's appearance as a point of contention, even if it's not a direct insult, can be harmful. The author's shame is their own issue, but bringing it up in arguments and affecting the boyfriend's feelings is where they're at fault. The answer is likely A, as the author is in the wrong for letting their personal insecurities impact the relationship and the boyfriend's well-being.\n"
