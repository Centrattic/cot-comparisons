My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. They've been together over a year, and he's really sweet and considerate. The author is okay with his appearance personally but doesn't want friends to meet him due to fear of judgment. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but progress is slow because of his busy schedule and habits. When they argue, the author brings up his weight, which makes him apologize. The author loves him and says they're fine with his looks, but the shame is a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's shame about their boyfriend's weight, which is affecting the relationship. Even though the author claims to be okay with his appearance, they avoid friends meeting him. That seems contradictory. Also, bringing up his weight during arguments can be hurtful, even if unintentionally. The boyfriend is affected by it and apologizes, which suggests that the author's comments are impacting him negatively.\n\nShaming someone about their body, even if it's out of a desire to help, can be harmful. The author's actions, like avoiding friends meeting the boyfriend and using his weight as an argument point, might be contributing to his low self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, so the author's shame might be a significant emotional burden. It's important to respect a partner's feelings and not let their body size become a source of personal embarrassment. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and support, not on one person's insecurities or fears of social judgment. The author's behavior could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over their boyfriend's emotional well-being, which is a key factor in determining if they're in the wrong.\n"
