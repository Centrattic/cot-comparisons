My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's acceptable to be ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoid introducing him to friends.\n\nFirst, the author says they're fine with his looks but still feel ashamed. That's a key point. Feeling ashamed of someone for their body size can be problematic because it's a form of body shaming, which is generally considered harmful. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing him, the fact that they hide him from friends suggests they're not comfortable with his appearance, which can affect his self-esteem.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight despite a busy schedule. The author brings up his weight during arguments, which he takes personally. That's a red flag. Using someone's weight as a point of contention in arguments can be emotionally damaging, even if the author isn't intentionally cruel. It shows that the author's comments are hurting him, which is not healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe author loves him and says he's the nicest guy, but the actions (hiding him, bringing up weight in fights) don't align with that love. Healthy relationships should be supportive, not make someone feel ashamed. The author's behavior could be leading to self-esteem issues for the boyfriend and might strain their relationship long-term.\n\nSo, even if the author doesn't realize the impact of their actions, they are contributing to a situation where the boyfriend feels he needs to apologize for his body. That's inconsiderate and unfair. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
