My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and making it an argument point.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a relationship where they love their boyfriend and acknowledge he's sweet and considerate. However, they feel ashamed of his weight and avoid friends meeting him. They mention that the boyfriend is aware and trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes uses his weight as a point in arguments, which affects him negatively.\n\nNow, considering ethical and relationship standards, shame and body image issues can be problematic. The author's feelings are valid, but acting on them in a way that harms the partner isn't. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's concerned about their feelings. However, the author's actions\u2014using weight as an argument, causing him to apologize\u2014might contribute to his insecurity. This dynamic can be unhealthy. It's important to respect a partner's body and avoid using their insecurities as leverage in conflicts. While the author isn't intentionally malicious, their behavior still has negative impacts. So, they might be in the wrong (A) because they're perpetuating shame despite loving him. Alternatively, if the author is struggling with their own insecurities, that's a personal issue, but it's still their responsibility to address it constructively. The key here is whether the shame and using it as an argument point is acceptable. Most advice would suggest that it's not healthy, so the answer is likely A.\n"
