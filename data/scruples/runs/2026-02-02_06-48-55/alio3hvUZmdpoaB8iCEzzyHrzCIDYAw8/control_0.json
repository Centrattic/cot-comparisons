My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids having friends meet him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The author sometimes uses his weight as an argument point, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says they're fine with his looks but don't want friends to meet him. That shame is the main issue. Also, bringing up his weight during arguments is problematic. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's actions might be hurting him. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's feelings is important. The author's shame could be causing emotional distress. Even if they don't realize the impact, making someone feel ashamed about their body is generally wrong. Also, using body issues as argument points is a red flag. The boyfriend's efforts to improve are positive, but the author's behavior might undermine his confidence.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They need to address their own feelings of shame and how their actions affect their partner. It's about respecting his feelings and supporting him instead of making him feel bad.\n"
