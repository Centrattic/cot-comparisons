My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they love him and he's a good partner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, so they avoid introducing him to friends. They mentioned that their boyfriend is trying to lose weight but progress is slow. However, when arguments happen, the writer uses his weight as a point, which makes the boyfriend apologize. \n\nNow, thinking about the ethical aspects. Feeling ashamed of someone for their appearance isn't uncommon, but acting on it can be problematic. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but is making efforts. The writer's behavior might be causing him emotional distress. Using his weight in arguments is hurtful, even if the writer isn't directly insulting him. The fact that he apologizes after these arguments suggests that he's affected, which could mean the writer's actions are contributing to his insecurities.\n\nAlso, the writer is in a healthy relationship in terms of his partner's behavior towards them, but their own feelings are causing a problem. It's important to consider that body shaming, even indirectly, can harm the relationship. The writer's avoidance of introducing him to friends due to shame could be seen as discriminatory or disrespectful towards his body.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer isn't outright bullying or making him feel bad about himself all the time. They do acknowledge his efforts and love him. However, the act of being ashamed and using his weight in arguments is still a form of being in the wrong because it's affecting his self-esteem and their relationship negatively.\n\nI think the key here is whether the shame and using weight as an argument point are justified. Since the writer admits they feel ashamed and it's causing the boyfriend distress, even if unintentionally, they are at fault. The right thing would be to address their own feelings without making the boyfriend feel bad. So, the answer is probably A, the writer is in the wrong.\n"
