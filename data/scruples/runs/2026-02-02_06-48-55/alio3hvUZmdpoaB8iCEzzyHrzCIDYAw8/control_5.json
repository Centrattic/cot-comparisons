      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend due to his weight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate, always putting the author's needs first. The author is in good shape, while he's overweight. She's okay with his appearance but avoids introducing him to friends because she doesn't want to be judged. She's discussed this with him, and he's making efforts to lose weight, though progress is slow due to his schedule and habits. During arguments, she brings up his weight, which affects him and makes him apologize. She loves him and acknowledges he's the nicest guy she's met.\n\nNow, considering the key points here: being ashamed based on someone's body is a sensitive issue. The author is making her boyfriend feel bad during arguments, which can be harmful. Even if she's not outwardly cruel, using his weight as an argument point and causing him to apologize suggests she's making him feel insecure. The fact that he's making efforts to change shows he's self-conscious, and her comments might be exacerbating that. Body shaming is generally considered wrong, and even if it's not direct, the emotional impact is there.\n\nThe author's avoidance of friends meeting him because of shame is also problematic. It's important to accept a partner for who they are, not just how they look. Loving him but being ashamed contradicts genuine acceptance. The boyfriend's apology after arguments indicates he feels guilty or inadequate, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions she's fine with his appearance and that he's a great person. But actions speak louder than words. The behavior described (using weight in arguments, avoiding friends) shows underlying shame and judgment. Relationships should be supportive, not make the other person feel bad about themselves. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is indeed in the wrong because her actions and words are contributing to her boyfriend's insecurity and affecting their relationship negatively. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
