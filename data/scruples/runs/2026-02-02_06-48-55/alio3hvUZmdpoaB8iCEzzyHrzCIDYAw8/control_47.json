Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that the boyfriend is sweet and prioritizes their well-being. She's okay with his looks but feels ashamed when friends see him. She's discussed this with him multiple times, and he's trying to lose weight. However, he's making slow progress due to a busy schedule and habits. She brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him, and he apologizes. She loves him but doesn't want friends to meet him because of the shame.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if she's in the wrong. Shaming someone for their weight is a common issue. Even if she's not overtly mean, feeling ashamed and bringing it up during arguments can be harmful. The boyfriend is trying to improve, but the fact that she uses his weight as an argument point could be damaging to his self-esteem. Even if she's supportive otherwise, the underlying issue is that she's ashamed, which can lead to internalized weight stigma. \n\nAlso, relationships should be about mutual respect and support. If her feelings of shame are causing conflict or affecting his efforts, that's a problem. The boyfriend's apology after arguments suggests that he feels the criticism affects him negatively. Even if she's not overtly cruel, the fact that she's avoiding friends meeting him because of his weight is a form of shame that's not healthy in a relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that she is in the wrong (A) because she's allowing her feelings of shame to impact her partner's self-worth and their relationship dynamics, even if her intentions aren't malicious.\n"
