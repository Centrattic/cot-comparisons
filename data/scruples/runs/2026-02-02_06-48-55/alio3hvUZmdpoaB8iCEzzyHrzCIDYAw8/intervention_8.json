Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged.

However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with a guy they find sweet and caring, but they feel ashamed of his weight and avoid introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but has tried to lose it upon the author's comments. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author says they don't want friends to meet the boyfriend because they feel ashamed. Even though the author claims they're fine with his weight, their actions (avoiding friends) show a conflict. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which he might be doing because of the pressure from the author. Using weight as an argument point is definitely problematic because it can hurt the other person's self-esteem. The boyfriend's instant apology after arguments suggests he's hurt and possibly internalizing the criticism, which isn't healthy.\n\nNow, I should think about the ethical implications. Feeling ashamed of someone's body is a personal feeling, but acting on it by excluding them from social interactions and making it a point of contention is where the issue lies. The author's actions could be contributing to the boyfriend's self-esteem issues, even if unintentionally. The boyfriend's efforts to diet and exercise might be driven by the author's comments, leading to potential health issues if he's not doing it for himself. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respect in a relationship. Making someone's body a topic during arguments isn't respectful. It's important to support a partner's self-image unless there are health concerns, which aren't mentioned here. The author's behavior might be fostering insecurity in the boyfriend, which can strain the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author loves the boyfriend and acknowledges his kindness. However, the shame and avoidance are harmful. The key here is whether the author's feelings are valid or if they're projecting their own insecurities onto the relationship. The fact that the boyfriend is making efforts because of the author's comments suggests that the author's behavior is influencing his self-perception negatively.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have good intentions, their actions are causing emotional harm. The shame and using weight as an argument point are not acceptable in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
