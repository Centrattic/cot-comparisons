My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is sweet and makes efforts to lose weight, but the author avoids showing him to friends because of their own shame. The author also brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's feelings versus the impact on their partner. The boyfriend is trying his best with diet and exercise, but the author is still ashamed. Even though the author says they're fine with his weight, their actions (avoiding friends and bringing up the issue during arguments) are causing him distress. That seems like a problem. The boyfriend is already making efforts, and the author's behavior is making him apologize and feel bad. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other. If the author is uncomfortable with their partner's body, especially when it's not affecting their relationship except for the author's self-image, then it's their own issue. But putting that pressure on the boyfriend to change for their sake, even if he's making efforts, can be harmful. The author might be prioritizing their own social anxiety over their partner's well-being. \n\nAlso, using the boyfriend's weight as an argument point is definitely not healthy. It's a personal issue that's being weaponized during conflicts, which can damage trust and affection. The boyfriend's prioritizing the author's needs shows he's considerate, but the author isn't reciprocating that support. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're making their partner feel ashamed and are not supporting him emotionally. They should address their own feelings of shame instead of expecting the boyfriend to change for them. The answer is A.\n"
