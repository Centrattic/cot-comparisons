My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends, even though they love him and he's trying to improve. The boyfriend is okay with his weight, but the author brings up the issue during arguments, making him feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is feeling ashamed, which is a personal feeling, but acting on it by avoiding friends could be hurtful. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, which shows he's responsive to her concerns. However, the author is making weight a point of contention during arguments, which can be emotionally damaging. Even if she's not outwardly criticizing him, the fact that she's ashamed and uses it as an argument point suggests she's internalizing judgment that might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's feelings are being affected, leading him to apologize. That indicates he's hurt by her comments. The author claims she's okay with his appearance but doesn't want friends to see him, which is a contradiction. She's comfortable with him but not with others seeing him, which is about her own social anxiety or societal pressures rather than his actual worth.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's self-esteem. If one partner's insecurities affect the other's self-image, that's a problem. The author might not be outright cruel, but her actions and words during conflicts are contributing to his emotional distress. It's about how she handles this issue. Even if she's trying to help him by discussing weight, doing so in the heat of an argument is not constructive. The fact that he's making slow progress doesn't excuse her making it a recurring issue. So, yes, she's in the wrong because her shame and using it as a leverage in arguments are harmful, even if her intentions are to help. The answer should be A.\n"
