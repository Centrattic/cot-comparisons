My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation involves the author being in a relationship with a sweet, considerate boyfriend who's overweight. The author is okay with his looks but doesn't want friends to meet him due to feeling judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but is making slow progress, and the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive qualities. The issue is the author's shame about his weight, leading to hiding him from friends and using his weight as an argument point. The boyfriend is affected by this, which indicates it's causing emotional harm.\n\nShaming someone for their body is generally considered harmful. Even if the author isn't directly hostile, the shame and using weight as a point of contention during arguments can be damaging. Body image issues are personal, but making someone feel that their body is a problem in a relationship can erode self-esteem. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight show he's aware of the concern, but the author's approach might be pressuring him in a negative way.\n\nAlso, the author's friends not meeting the boyfriend due to shame could isolate the boyfriend and prevent the relationship from being fully integrated into the author's life. This might indicate deeper insecurities or societal pressures the author is facing, but it's still the author's responsibility to address those feelings without shaming their partner.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without making someone feel inadequate. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, contribute to the boyfriend's emotional distress. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes after arguments about his weight suggests that the author's comments are hurtful, even if they don't realize it.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they are allowing their shame to affect their partner's self-esteem and the relationship dynamic. They should address their feelings constructively rather than letting them lead to judgment and conflict.\n"
