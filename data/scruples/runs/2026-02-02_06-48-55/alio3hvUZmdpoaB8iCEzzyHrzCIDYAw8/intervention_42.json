My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the author states they're fine with how their boyfriend looks but don't want friends to meet him because they feel ashamed. Even though the boyfriend is okay with his appearance, the author brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him emotionally. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow due to his schedule and habits.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings of shame and bringing up the weight issue in arguments. Even if the author isn't outwardly cruel, using someone's appearance as a point of contention during arguments can be hurtful. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are commendable, but the author's actions might undermine his confidence. The fact that the author avoids friends meeting the boyfriend due to shame suggests a deeper insecurity or societal pressure affecting their relationship. While the author isn't the worst person, prioritizing their own comfort over their partner's feelings and contributing to his emotional distress does place responsibility on them. So, the answer is A.\n"
