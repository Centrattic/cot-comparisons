My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, and even though the author says they're okay with his looks, they avoid friends meeting him because they feel judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow, and the author sometimes brings it up during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's feelings of shame might stem from societal pressures or personal insecurities. They mention that their boyfriend is making efforts, which is positive, but bringing up his weight during arguments is clearly affecting him emotionally. Even if the author is not directly criticizing him, using his appearance as a point of contention in arguments can be hurtful. \n\nThe boyfriend's well-being is prioritized by him, but the author's actions (avoiding friends, using weight as an argument point) might undermine that. The fact that he apologizes suggests that he feels the comments are his fault, which can be damaging to his self-esteem. \n\nAlso, the author is in a good shape, which might contribute to their self-consciousness. However, everyone deserves to be accepted for who they are, regardless of appearance. Making someone feel ashamed about their body, even indirectly, is not supportive. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight should be encouraged without making him feel like his worth is tied to his success in that.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without conditions. If the author is uncomfortable with their friends meeting the boyfriend because of his weight, that's a personal issue that needs to be addressed, not something the boyfriend should have to fix. The fact that the author brings it up during arguments shows that it's a sensitive and recurring issue, which can erode trust and affection over time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's behavior is contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress. Even if the author isn't outright cruel, the shame and using his weight as an argument point is harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
