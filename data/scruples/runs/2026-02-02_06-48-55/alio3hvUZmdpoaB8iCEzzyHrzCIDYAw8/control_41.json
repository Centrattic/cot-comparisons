My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they claim to be okay with it. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but it's hard for him due to his schedule and habits. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions loving their boyfriend and acknowledging his kindness. However, the feeling of shame about his appearance and the impact on their social interactions is a key point. Even if the author is fine with his looks privately, the public shame and using his weight as an argument point could be problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are noted, but the author's approach might be contributing to his lack of progress. Criticizing someone's weight, especially in the context of a relationship, can lead to low self-esteem and pressure. The fact that he apologizes after arguments suggests he feels hurt or inadequate because of her comments. \n\nAlso, the author's desire to avoid friends seeing them together because of shame indicates an internal conflict. While it's not uncommon for people to have insecurities, acting on those feelings by making the partner feel bad isn't healthy. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and support. The author's actions might be undermining the boyfriend's self-worth and their own relationship's foundation.\n\nIt's important to consider whether the criticism is constructive or just a reflection of the author's own insecurities. If the boyfriend is making efforts, the author's role should be supportive rather than critical. The fact that the author brings up weight during arguments shows a lack of empathy and could be a controlling behavior under the guise of concern.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not be malicious, their behavior is harmful and disrespectful. They are in the wrong because they are letting their personal insecurities affect their treatment of the boyfriend negatively. The correct answer is A.\n"
