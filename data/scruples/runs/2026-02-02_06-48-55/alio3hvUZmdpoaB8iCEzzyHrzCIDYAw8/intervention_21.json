My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends to prevent judgment. They admit that the boyfriend is sweet and makes efforts to improve, but the author uses his weight as a point in arguments, making the boyfriend apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author's feelings of shame towards their partner's body, even though they personally accept it. Then there's the impact on the boyfriend\u2014being affected by the arguments and apologizing, which sounds like it's hurting his self-esteem. The author's actions are causing emotional distress to someone they claim to love. \n\nIt's important to recognize that body shaming, even if not outwardly aggressive, can be harmful when it's used in arguments or leads someone to apologize for their body. The boyfriend is making efforts, which the author acknowledges, but the root issue is the author's shame and fear of judgment from friends. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a compassionate perspective, making someone feel ashamed of themselves in a relationship, especially when they're making an effort, is problematic. The author's behavior could be seen as contributing to the boyfriend's self-esteem issues. Even if they claim to accept him, the actions (avoiding friends, using weight as a point of arguments) contradict that acceptance. \n\nAlso, relationships should be built on mutual respect and support. If the author is causing the boyfriend to feel he needs to apologize for his body, that's a sign of an unhealthy dynamic. The fact that the boyfriend is \"quite affected\" suggests emotional harm. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because their behavior is causing emotional harm and fostering insecurity in the boyfriend, despite their positive intentions or feelings towards him.\n"
