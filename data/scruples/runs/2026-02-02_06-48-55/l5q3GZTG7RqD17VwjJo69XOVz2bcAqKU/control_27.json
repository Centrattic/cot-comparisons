I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent has been okay with it until recently when they discovered some concerning behaviors from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother is acting inappropriately. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent. The mother then insists the daughter take prescribed medication. That's a problem because the parent should be involved in such decisions. The boyfriend is also pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and he's defending his mother's actions.\n\nThe parent felt these were red flags and broke up the relationship. The question is if the parent is wrong. \n\nLegally, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother overstepping by making medical decisions without the parent's knowledge is a serious issue. Also, the boyfriend's support of his mother's actions could indicate a toxic dynamic. The parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and well-being. \n\nWhile the parent is interfering in the daughter's relationship, the daughter is underage, and the parent's duty of care comes into play here. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is manipulative and overstepping boundaries. The parent is acting to protect their child from potential harm. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
