I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parents have been okay with the relationship until now.\n\nThe main issues here are the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing. She's telling the daughter to think of her as a mother, makes comments about how the author raised her, and even arranged a therapy appointment without informing the author. The boyfriend is supporting this and even pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The author feels this is toxic and a threat to their child's safety, so they asked the daughter to break up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The daughter is a minor, so the parents have a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping by inserting herself into the daughter's life in a parental role, which could be a form of emotional manipulation. The mother arranging appointments and pressuring the daughter without the author's consent is concerning. The boyfriend's involvement in this suggests he's enabling the behavior, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe parents have the right to intervene if they believe their child is in a harmful situation. Even if the relationship seemed okay before, new red flags like this could justify their actions. The key here is the mother's interference and the boyfriend's support of it, which might indicate a controlling dynamic. The author's decision to break them up is based on safety concerns, so unless there's evidence of the author acting without reason or overreacting, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nBut I should check if the parents have the legal right to end their daughter's relationship. Since she's a minor, parents can make decisions for their children, but it's a gray area. However, the mother's actions by the boyfriend's side are problematic, so the author is trying to protect their daughter. The boyfriend's mother is essentially trying to take over the parenting role, which is inappropriate. The author's intervention could be seen as a protective measure rather than overstepping, especially given the potential manipulation and pressure involved.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting in their child's best interest based on the described toxic behaviors.\n"
