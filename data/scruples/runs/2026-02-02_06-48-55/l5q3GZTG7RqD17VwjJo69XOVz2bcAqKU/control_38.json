I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent hasn't had issues before, but now there are some concerning behaviors from the boyfriend's mom. The mom is acting like a mother figure, telling the daughter to think of her as her mom, even suggesting that once married, she'll have a good mother. Then there's this part where the daughter felt depressed, and the mom arranged an appointment and told her to take medication without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend and his mom are pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent breaks up the relationship because of these red flags.\n\nHmm, the parent's main concern is about the daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mom is crossing boundaries by taking on a parental role, making decisions about mental health care without the actual parent's input, and pressuring the daughter. The parent is acting out of concern for their child's safety. Even though the daughter is a minor, the parent has the right to protect her from what they perceive as a toxic situation. The boyfriend's support of his mom's actions adds to the parent's worry. Breaking up the relationship might be a tough call, but if there's evidence of manipulation and potential harm, it's a parent's responsibility to step in. The parent isn't wrong for prioritizing their child's safety over the relationship. So, the answer is B.\n"
