I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship with a 17-year-old boyfriend. The daughter is 16, so they're both minors. The parent discovered the boyfriend's mother has been acting overbearing, trying to take on a maternal role, making decisions about the daughter's mental health without consulting the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was toxic and broke up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since both the daughter and boyfriend are minors, parents typically have legal authority to make decisions affecting their children's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem problematic\u2014interfering in parenting decisions, controlling medical appointments, and pressuring the daughter. The parent's concern for their child's safety and mental health is valid. \n\nHowever, breaking up a teenager's relationship is a big step. The parent should ideally communicate with the daughter first, understand her perspective, and perhaps involve the boyfriend's family in a constructive way. But given the described red flags\u2014like the boyfriend's mother acting as a surrogate parent and undermining the parent\u2014it's understandable why the parent feels compelled to intervene. \n\nThe parent isn't necessarily the wrongdoer here. Their actions stem from concern for their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's family's behavior is the main issue. The parent might have handled it differently, maybe by setting boundaries or seeking counseling, but breaking the relationship under these circumstances could be seen as a protective measure. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
