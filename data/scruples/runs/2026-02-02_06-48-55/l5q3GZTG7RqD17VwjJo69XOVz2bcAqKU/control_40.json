I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mother has been acting overbearing, calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without consulting the parent. The boyfriend and his mother are pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is supportive of his mom's actions.\n\nFirst, the parent's concern seems valid. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping, acting as a substitute parent, and possibly manipulating the situation. The daughter's mental health is a key point here\u2014being pressured to take medication prescribed by someone else without the parent's knowledge is a red flag. The parent is worried about their daughter's safety and well-being, which is a natural instinct.\n\nThe boyfriend's support exacerbates the issue. If he's not calling out his mother's behavior or protecting his girlfriend, that shows a lack of support for the daughter's autonomy and a potential alliance with his mother against her. The parent's decision to intervene might be harsh, but the underlying issues (toxic dynamics, manipulation) justify the action. The parent isn't just being overprotective; they're responding to clear signs of a controlling and harmful relationship. The daughter's age also plays a role\u201416 is still a minor, and parents have a responsibility to protect their children from such situations. The key here is whether the parent acted unreasonably. Since the parent had legitimate concerns and the boyfriend's mother was actively undermining them, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
