I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy they've been with for three years. The parents have been okay with the relationship until recently, when the boyfriend's mother started acting inappropriately.\n\nSo the mother of the boyfriend is telling the daughter to see her as a mother figure, calling her a future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised their daughter, and even arranging a therapy appointment without informing the parent. She also pressures the daughter to move in with them. The boyfriend supports his mother's actions, which the parent sees as toxic and manipulative, leading them to ask their daughter to break up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the parent acted wrongly. The parent's main concerns are about the boyfriend's mother overstepping boundaries and potentially manipulating their daughter. The parent is trying to protect their child from what they perceive as a harmful situation. \n\nIn terms of the relationship between the two teenagers, it's a long-term one, and the parent had no issues before this. The new developments by the boyfriend's mother are the key factors here. The mother's actions seem to be encroaching on the parent's role and undermining their authority. The parent intervened because they felt the relationship had toxic elements that could affect their daughter's safety and well-being.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to make decisions for their minor children, and 16 is still a minor in most places. So the parent's intervention might be within their rights. However, ethically, it's more complex. The daughter might feel that her autonomy is being infringed, especially if she's happy in the relationship. But the parent's role is to protect, even if that means making tough decisions.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother's behavior is problematic. She's not just being a supportive figure but is actively trying to replace the daughter's mother, which is a red flag. The parent's response is to end the relationship to protect their daughter from what they see as manipulation. \n\nThe question is whether the parent was wrong. Given the circumstances, the parent is acting in what they believe is their daughter's best interest. While it's a tough call and the daughter might feel it's an overreaction, the parent is addressing potential harm. Therefore, the parent is probably not in the wrong here. They're responding to legitimate concerns about the boyfriend's mother's behavior and the boyfriend's support of it.\n"
