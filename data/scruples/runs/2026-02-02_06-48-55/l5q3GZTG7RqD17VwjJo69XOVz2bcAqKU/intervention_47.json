I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. The parent's daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. They've been fine with the relationship until recently when the boyfriend's mother started acting overly involved. The mother calls the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizes the parent's parenting, arranges a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent, and pressures her to move in. The parent then tells their daughter to break up with the boy because of these red flags.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. The daughter is a minor, so her parents have a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping\u2014interfering in medical decisions, undermining the parent's authority, and trying to take over the role of a mother. That's concerning. The mother arranging the appointment without the parent's knowledge is a big issue because minors usually need parental consent for medical treatment, especially medication. That could be a breach of confidentiality if the mother had no right to do that.\n\nThe parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being. They're trying to protect her from what they perceive as a toxic and manipulative relationship. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the parent's concern. While the daughter is in a long-term relationship, the parent's role is to ensure her safety, even if it means ending the relationship.\n\nIs the parent overstepping by breaking them up? The daughter is 16, so she's still under her parent's care. Parents can make decisions for their minor children, especially regarding their safety and mental health. If the parent believes the boyfriend's mother is a threat, they have a right to intervene. The parent isn't just acting on a whim\u2014they have specific concerns about manipulation and control. \n\nHowever, maybe the parent should have discussed this with the daughter first instead of just telling her to break up. But given the urgency of the situation and the potential harm, their actions could be justified. The boyfriend's mother's actions might be a form of emotional abuse or parental alienation. \n\nThe parent might be in the right here because their primary duty is to protect their child. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is inappropriate, and the parent is taking steps to mitigate that. So the answer is probably B\u2014the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
