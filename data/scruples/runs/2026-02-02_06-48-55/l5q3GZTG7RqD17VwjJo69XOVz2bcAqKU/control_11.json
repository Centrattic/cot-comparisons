I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parents were okay with it until the boyfriend's mom started acting like a mom to the daughter. The mom-in-law is calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging medical appointments without consulting the parent. The boyfriend's mom is pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is supporting this. The parent thinks it's toxic and breaks them up.\n\nFirst, the parent's main concern is about the daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping, acting as a substitute parent, and possibly manipulating the daughter. The parent is trying to protect their child from what they see as a toxic influence. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has a responsibility to ensure her safety. The actions of the boyfriend's mother\u2014like arranging medical appointments without the parent's knowledge\u2014could be problematic, even if well-intentioned. Pressuring a teenager to move out might be a red flag for control or manipulation.\n\nThe parent's response was to ask the daughter to break up with the boyfriend. While it's a parent's role to protect, some might argue that the parent didn't give the daughter a chance to handle the situation herself. However, given the age of the daughter and the concerning behavior from the boyfriend's family, the parent's intervention seems justified. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the toxicity. \n\nSo, considering the parent's intent to protect their child from potential harm and the red flags present, the parent's action is reasonable. The answer is likely B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
