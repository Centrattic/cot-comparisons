I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent was initially okay with the relationship. But now, the boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother figure to the daughter. She's making comments about the parent's parenting, suggesting the daughter will have a better mother once married, and even arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend and his mother are pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and toxic, so they told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the parent's actions. The key here is whether the parent overstepped. The parent noticed red flags, like the boyfriend's mother taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions without involving the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in. These are serious concerns. The parent's role is to protect their child from potential harm. If there's evidence of manipulation or undue influence, stepping in is reasonable.\n\nBut wait, the parent isn't just expressing concern; they directly asked the daughter to break up. That's a heavy-handed approach. However, given the described situation\u2014where the boyfriend's mother is trying to insert herself into the daughter's life in a harmful way\u2014the parent might feel justified. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to ensure her safety and well-being. If there's a real threat of manipulation or mental health interference, the parent's intervention could be seen as necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is interfering in the teenager's romantic life. But the boyfriend's mother's actions cross lines that aren't typical parent-like behavior. The fact that the daughter was feeling depressed and the mother-in-law took over the mental health decisions without consulting the parent is a red flag. The pressure to move in with them also seems inappropriate.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent is likely acting in the daughter's best interest. They identified concerning behaviors and took action to protect her. While breaking up the relationship directly might be seen as harsh, the underlying issues are significant. So the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
