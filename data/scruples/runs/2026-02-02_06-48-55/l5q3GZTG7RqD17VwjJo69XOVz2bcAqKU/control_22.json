I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The mother-in-law is acting like a mother to the daughter, making her feel like she's her future daughter, criticizing how they raised her, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the parent. Also, there's pressure to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're a guardian, so their responsibility is to protect their child. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem overstepping. Taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions without the parent's knowledge is a big red flag. Plus, the pressure to move in could be a form of manipulation. The parent might be trying to protect their daughter from a potentially toxic dynamic, even if the relationship itself isn't obviously problematic on the surface.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent did break up the relationship, which is a significant action. The daughter might feel that her autonomy is being undermined. However, at 16, the daughter is still a minor, and the parent has legal and moral responsibility for her well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is concerning, and the parent has valid reasons to intervene to protect their child from possible emotional harm.\n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the parent's concerns. If the boyfriend is enabling this, it's a sign of toxicity in the relationship. The parent's decision is based on safety and well-being, which is a parent's role. While the parent might have handled it differently, the main issue is the external manipulation from the boyfriend's mother, which the parent is trying to stop.\n\nSo, the parent is probably not in the wrong here. They acted to protect their daughter from a situation that could be harmful. The answer should be B.\n"
