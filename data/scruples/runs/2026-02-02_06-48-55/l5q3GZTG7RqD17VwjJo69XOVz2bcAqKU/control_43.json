I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is concerned about their 16-year-old daughter's 3-year relationship with a 17-year-old boy. The main issue seems to be the boy's mother's behavior. She's been acting like a mother figure, making decisions for the daughter, and criticizing the parent's parenting. The daughter started feeling depressed, and the boyfriend's mom arranged medical appointments without informing the parent. The parent confronted the situation, but the boyfriend supported his mother, and the couple even pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent then broke them up because they felt it was toxic.\n\nFirst, the parent's actions are driven by concern for their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping, possibly manipulative, and making decisions that should be the parent's role. The daughter's mental health is a key point here\u2014being forced into medical treatment without parental consent is a red flag. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests he's part of this dynamic, which could make the relationship toxic.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, parents have the right to make medical decisions for minors. If the boyfriend's mother is overriding the parent's authority here, that's a problem. The parent's decision to break up the relationship is a protective measure. Even though the daughter is 16, she's still a minor, and parents have a responsibility to ensure her safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses boundaries that could harm the daughter's relationship with her own parent and her autonomy.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the parent could have tried to address the issue with the boyfriend's family first before breaking up the relationship. But given the severity of the red flags\u2014mental health interference, pressure to move in, undermining the parent\u2014it's reasonable for the parent to act. The key here is the parent's intent to protect, not control. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions makes the situation more concerning. The parent isn't just being overprotective; there are clear manipulative elements. So, the parent is justified in their actions. Answer B.\n"
