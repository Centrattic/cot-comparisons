I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent breaking up their 16-year-old daughter's three-year relationship with a 17-year-old boy because of concerns about the boy's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been in a long-term relationship, and the parents were initially okay with it. But then the boyfriend's mother starts acting in ways that seem overbearing. She's calling the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge. The mother also pushes the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their authority, so they break up the relationship.\n\nI need to consider if the parent acted wrongly here. The parent's main concern is the daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions do sound concerning\u2014interfering in parenting decisions, making unilateral decisions about the daughter's health, and trying to relocate the daughter. The parent's intervention could be seen as protective. However, breaking up a teenager's long-term relationship isn't a small step. The parent should consider the daughter's feelings and maybe involve her in the decision, rather than making it for her. But given the red flags mentioned, the parent might believe they're acting in the daughter's best interest to prevent manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 16, so the parent might be overstepping by ending the relationship without her consent. However, the parent's role is to protect the child, especially from potential harm. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem like they could be overstepping boundaries, and the boy supporting this might indicate a toxic dynamic.\n\nThe key factors here are the parent's intent to protect their child from what they perceive as a harmful situation. While it's important to respect the daughter's autonomy, the parent's decision might be justified given the red flags. The answer likely depends on whether the parent's actions are seen as reasonable protection or as overstepping. Since the mother-in-law's behavior is questionable and the parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's safety, the parent might be in the right.\n"
