I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent breaking up their 16-year-old daughter's three-year relationship with a 17-year-old boy because of the boy's mother's behavior and the boy's support of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent discovered that the boyfriend's mother was acting overstepping, treating the daughter as her own, interfering in the daughter's mental health by arranging an appointment without the parent's knowledge, and even pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent felt this was manipulative and a threat to their daughter's safety, so they made the daughter break up with the boyfriend.\n\nNow, the key points here are the parent's concern for their daughter's well-being versus the daughter's autonomy. However, since the daughter is a minor (16), the parent might have a legal and moral duty to protect her from harmful influences. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem to be overreaching, possibly gaslighting or manipulating both the daughter and the boyfriend. The boyfriend supporting this behavior is also a red flag.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, parents have the right to make decisions regarding their minor children's relationships if they believe it's in the child's best interest, especially if there are signs of manipulation or harm. The parent here is acting on valid concerns about the daughter's safety and mental health, so their intervention might be justified. The daughter, being a minor, might not have the full capacity to recognize these red flags, so the parent stepping in could be seen as necessary.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the daughter's happiness. She's been with the boy for three years, and the parent is breaking them up. But given the boyfriend's mother's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's support, the parent's action is protective. The parent isn't just acting on suspicion but has concrete examples of overreach and potential harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong. Their actions are driven by concern for their daughter's safety and well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The answer should be B (No).\n"
