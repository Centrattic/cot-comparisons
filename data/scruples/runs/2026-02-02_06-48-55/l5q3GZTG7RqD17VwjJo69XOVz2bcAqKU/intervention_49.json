I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a parent) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The parent noticed the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing, trying to take the parent's role, pressuring the daughter, and the boyfriend supporting this. The parent then told the daughter to break up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're a parent concerned about their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping boundaries, acting as a surrogate parent, controlling aspects of the daughter's life (like mental health treatment), and possibly manipulating the daughter. The parent feels this is toxic and a threat to their authority and the daughter's safety. \n\nBut wait, the daughter is 16, so she's a minor, but in many places, they can date as it's within legal limits. The parent's role here is to protect their child, but stepping in and breaking up the relationship could be seen as overreach, especially if the daughter is happy. However, the mother-in-law's behavior seems genuinely manipulative and harmful. The boyfriend's support of this could indicate he's part of the toxic dynamic. \n\nOn the other hand, by intervening so directly, the parent might be violating the daughter's autonomy, assuming she's capable of making her own decisions. But given the daughter's age and the parent's responsibility to protect her, it's a gray area. The parent is acting out of concern for manipulation and safety, which are valid parental instincts. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong. If the mother's actions are indeed harmful and the parent is trying to prevent further manipulation, then maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the parent overreacted without considering the daughter's feelings or autonomy, that could be an issue. The parent didn't involve the boyfriend's mother or the boyfriend himself but directly told the daughter to break up, which might be harsh. \n\nIn some cases, parents might be advised to communicate with the other parent or involve the child's own decisions. However, given the context of the mother trying to undermine the parent and pressure the daughter, the parent might feel justified. The key factors are the manipulative behavior, the daughter's age and vulnerability, and the parent's role in protecting her. \n\nI think the parent's actions, while possibly harsh, are driven by concern for their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses into manipulative and overbearing territory, which the parent is trying to stop. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong, even if the approach could have been handled differently. So the answer is B.\n"
