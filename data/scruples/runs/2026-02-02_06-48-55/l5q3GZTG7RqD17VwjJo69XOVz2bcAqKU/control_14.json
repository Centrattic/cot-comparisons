I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parents have never had a problem with the relationship before, but recently the boyfriend's mother has been acting inappropriately. She's been calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the author's parenting, arranging a therapy appointment without informing the author, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The author confronted the mother, who told her son, who then berated the daughter. The author decided to end the relationship because they see it as toxic and manipulative, fearing for their daughter's safety.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is justified in breaking them up. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). To decide, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend's mother stepping over boundaries by acting as a parent, making decisions without the actual parent's input, and trying to undermine the author's authority. The daughter is feeling depressed, and the mother took initiative in getting an appointment, which could be seen as overstepping. Also, the pressure to move in with them is another red flag. The author is a parent, so they have a responsibility to protect their child.\n\nLegally, parents can have a say in their minor children's decisions, especially regarding safety. The mother-in-law's actions do seem manipulative and could create a toxic environment. The author's decision to break up the relationship is based on these concerns. The boyfriend's reaction (berating the daughter) and the mother's pressure might indicate a lack of respect for the author's role. While the author might have acted abruptly, the underlying reasons\u2014protecting their child from potential harm\u2014seem valid. So, the author is likely not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
