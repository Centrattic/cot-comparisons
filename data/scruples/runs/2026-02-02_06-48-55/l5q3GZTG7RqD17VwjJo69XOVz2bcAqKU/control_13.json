I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The user's daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. Up until recently, the parent was happy with their relationship. Now, the boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother figure to the daughter, giving unsolicited advice, making decisions about her mental health (like arranging an appointment and pressuring medication), and even trying to get the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is overstepping, possibly manipulative, and a threat to their relationship with their daughter. The parent then broke up the couple to protect their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent was right to intervene. The key points here are the mother-in-law's behavior and the boyfriend's role. The boyfriend's mother is taking an active role in her mental health care without the parent's knowledge, which could be concerning. Parents generally have the right to protect their children, especially minors, from potential harm or manipulation. However, the daughter is a teenager, so the line between healthy parental concern and overstepping can be blurry.\n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions is a red flag. If the boyfriend is enabling his mother's behavior, that could indicate a toxic dynamic. The parent is worried about the daughter being indoctrinated and turned against them, which is a valid concern given the described actions. Breaking up the relationship to prevent potential harm might be seen as protective, especially if there's evidence of manipulation or coercion.\n\nHowever, the parent should consider whether their actions were necessary. Did they try discussing the issue with the boyfriend or his mother first? Or did they immediately decide to break up the relationship? If the parent acted without giving the other parties a chance to address the concerns, that could be seen as harsh. On the other hand, if the behavior was clearly crossing boundaries and the parent felt it was a safety issue, their intervention might be justified.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, she's still under 18, so parents have legal and moral responsibility to ensure her well-being. The mother-in-law's actions could be undermining the parent's role, which is a legitimate concern. The pressure on the daughter to move in with them and the unsolicited medical decisions are significant red flags. The parent's decision to break up the relationship might be seen as an overreaction if the daughter is happy, but given the described manipulative behavior, it's a protective measure.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's approach might be intense, their primary concern is the daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions are problematic, and the boyfriend's support of her exacerbates the issue. Therefore, the parent's decision to intervene isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
