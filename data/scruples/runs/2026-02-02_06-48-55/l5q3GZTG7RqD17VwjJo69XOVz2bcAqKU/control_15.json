I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The daughter is 16 and dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parents initially approved and were happy with the relationship. Then, the boyfriend's mother started acting in ways that raised concerns. She called the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticized how the parent raised her, and took control of the daughter's mental health by arranging therapy appointments and pushing medication, without informing the parent. The boyfriend and his mother also pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their daughter, so they told her to break up with the boy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is wrong. The parent's actions were based on concerns for their daughter's well-being and safety. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping and potentially harmful. The parent isn't just being a controlling parent; they're reacting to what they perceive as a threat from an external figure (the boyfriend's mother) who's trying to replace them and manipulate their child. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions is also a red flag.\n\nIn terms of the parent's responsibility, they have a duty to protect their child from toxic or harmful influences. The parent isn't breaking up the relationship for no reason but because there are clear manipulative tactics being used. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has some authority in making decisions for her safety. While the daughter's happiness in the relationship is mentioned, the parent's concern is about the underlying toxicity and potential harm.\n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the parent overstepped by breaking up the relationship, but given the described manipulative behavior from the boyfriend's side, the parent's intervention seems justified. The key is whether the parent's actions were proportionate. Since they identified multiple red flags and acted to protect their daughter, it's more about protecting her from potential harm rather than just disliking the boyfriend.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the answer would likely be B (No, the parent is not in the wrong) because they acted in their daughter's best interest based on the concerning behaviors observed.\n"
