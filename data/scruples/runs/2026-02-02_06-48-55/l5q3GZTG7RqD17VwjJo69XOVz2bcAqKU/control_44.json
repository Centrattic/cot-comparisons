I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, same high school. The parent has no prior issues but now found out the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, making criticisms, arranging therapy appointments without consulting the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent feels it's toxic and broke up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, especially minors. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem overstepping\u2014acting as a mother, undermining the parent, and taking control of the daughter's mental health care without the parent's input. That's a red flag. The parent might be justified in stepping in to protect their child from potential manipulation or harm.\n\nHowever, the parent did break up the relationship directly, which could be seen as overstepping. But given the context, if the parent had valid concerns about the mother's influence and the boyfriend's support of it, maybe it's reasonable. The daughter is still a minor, so the parent has some authority. The key is whether the parent's actions were proportionate. They didn't just confront the boyfriend's mom but ended the relationship. But since the boyfriend is complicit, maybe it's necessary to protect the daughter.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're acting in their child's best interest based on concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother. The answer is probably B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
