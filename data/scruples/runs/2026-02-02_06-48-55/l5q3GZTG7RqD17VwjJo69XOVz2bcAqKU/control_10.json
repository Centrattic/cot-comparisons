I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent has a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy they've known for three years. The parents have been fine with the relationship, even hosting him over and vice versa. Recently, the boyfriend's mother has been acting in a strange way. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and saying once she's married to her son, she'll have a good mother. Then there's the issue where the daughter mentioned feeling depressed, and the boyfriend's mother arranged an appointment for her without telling the parent. She also pressured the daughter to take medication. The parent confronted the mother, who then told her son, who in turn berated the daughter for telling her parent. Plus, the couple is pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels the mother is trying to take over and turn the daughter against them, so they broke up the relationship. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong (ATA).\n\nSo the key points here are the mother's overstepping behavior, the lack of parental involvement in the daughter's mental health, and the pressure to move in. The parent is concerned about the daughter's safety and well-being. The question is whether the parent is right to break up the relationship.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother is acting like a parent without the mother's consent, making decisions about her mental health. That's a big red flag. Also, the boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests he's complicit, which adds to the toxicity. Pressuring a teenager to move in with them could be a sign of grooming or manipulation, especially if the parents aren't involved. The parent is justified in stepping in to protect their child from potential harm. Breaking up the relationship might be tough, but the parent's primary concern is the daughter's safety. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses boundaries, and the boyfriend enabling it makes the situation toxic. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
