I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's long-term relationship based on concerns about the boyfriend's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. They've been together for three years, which is a significant amount of time. The parent initially supported the relationship and even allowed the boyfriend to stay over and have dinner. So the parent wasn't opposed before. The issue arises when the boyfriend's mother starts acting in ways that the parent finds concerning. The mother refers to the daughter as her future daughter, critiques the parent's parenting, and takes over decisions about the daughter's health (antidepressants) without consulting the parent. The mother also pressures the daughter to move in with them. The parent confronts the boyfriend, who then berates the daughter for telling the parent. The parent feels the relationship is toxic and manipulative, so they tell the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nNow, the user thinks the parent is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. The key points are the mother's actions. She's overstepping boundaries, making decisions about a child's health without the parent's input, and trying to insert herself into the daughter's life to the point of pressuring her to move in. This could be considered parental overreach or even a form of manipulation. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern, as he's enabling her behavior by berating the daughter for the parent's actions.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, the parent is acting in their child's best interest when they see signs of potential harm. The mother's actions could be undermining the parent's authority and creating a toxic environment. The parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and well-being, which is a valid reason for intervention. However, breaking up a three-year relationship is a major decision. The parent might not have explored other options first, like counseling or mediation between the families. But given the specific red flags (interference in medical decisions, pressure to move in, undermining the parent), it's within the parent's rights to act to protect their child.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother's actions could be seen as inappropriate, crossing into the role of a parent. The boyfriend's support of his mother's behavior suggests he's not a protective partner but rather one who is complicit in the manipulation. The parent's decision might be harsh, but given the potential risks, it's a protective measure. The parent isn't acting out of jealousy but genuine concern for their daughter's mental health and safety.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent is likely not in the wrong. They're responding to clear red flags that could harm their daughter. The boyfriend's mother's actions are problematic, and the boyfriend isn't standing up for his partner's autonomy. The parent's intervention is an overreaction in terms of breaking up the relationship, but given the circumstances, it's a justified step to protect their child. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
