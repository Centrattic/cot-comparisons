I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parents have been okay with the relationship until recently, when the boy's mother started acting in a concerning way. \n\nSo, the main issues here are the boyfriend's mother taking over parenting roles. She calls the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizes the parent's parenting, arranges a doctor's appointment for the daughter without informing the parent, and even pressures the daughter to move in with them. The boyfriend is supportive of his mother's actions, which the parent sees as toxic and manipulative. The parent then intervenes by asking the daughter to break up with the boy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's right to protect their child. The daughter is a minor, so the parent's concern about her safety and well-being is valid. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses boundaries by overstepping parental roles. For example, arranging medical appointments without the actual parent's knowledge is a red flag. It's not just about the relationship between the daughter and her boyfriend, but the influence of his family, which seems to undermine the parent's authority and could harm the daughter emotionally.\n\nHowever, breaking up a three-year relationship is a big step. The parent might be seen as overstepping if there are no immediate dangers. But given the described actions of the boyfriend's mother and the boyfriend's support, the parent's intervention might be justified to protect the daughter from emotional manipulation and potential harm. The parent's concern isn't just about the relationship's duration but the toxic elements introduced by the boyfriend's family. \n\nIn family law, parents have a duty to protect their children. If there's evidence of someone else trying to manipulate or harm the child, intervention is reasonable. The key here is whether the parent had valid reasons. The boyfriend's mother's actions are clearly invasive and controlling, and the boyfriend's support suggests he's complicit. So, the parent's decision to step in is more about protecting the daughter rather than just personal dislike of the boyfriend. \n\nTherefore, the parent is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
