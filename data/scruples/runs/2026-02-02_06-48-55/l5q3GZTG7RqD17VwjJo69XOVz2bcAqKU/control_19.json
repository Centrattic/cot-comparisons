I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship because of the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The daughter is 16, and the boyfriend is 17. They've been dating for three years, and the parent hasn't had issues before. Now, the mother of the boyfriend is acting like a parent to the daughter, making her feel like her own mother, arranging medical appointments without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in.\n\nSo, the parent is concerned about the mother's overstepping and possible manipulation. The boyfriend is supporting his mother's actions, which makes the parent think the relationship is toxic. The parent then tells the daughter to break up with him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the daughter and boyfriend. They're both minors, so parental involvement might be more justified. The mother-in-law's actions are definitely crossing boundaries. Taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions without informing the parent is a major red flag. The pressure to move in also seems manipulative. \n\nBut is the parent overstepping by breaking them up? Well, the parent's role is to protect their child. Even though the daughter is in a long-term relationship, the parent is responsible for her well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions are concerning, and the boyfriend's support of those actions could indicate he's part of the problem. \n\nThe parent isn't just acting on suspicion but has concrete examples of boundary violations and potential manipulation. The parent is trying to protect their daughter from a toxic situation. So, the parent's decision, while it might seem harsh, is based on valid concerns for the daughter's safety and mental health. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the parent is not in the wrong because they're responding to serious red flags that threaten their daughter's well-being.\n"
