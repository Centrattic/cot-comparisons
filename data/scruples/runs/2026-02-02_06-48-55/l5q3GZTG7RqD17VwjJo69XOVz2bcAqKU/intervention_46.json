I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship with her 17-year-old boyfriend because of concerns about the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, 16 and 17-year-olds can date and even engage in consensual relationships if they're both of age (which varies by jurisdiction). The parent's role is to protect their child, but intervening in a relationship can be a grey area. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing, trying to replace the parent, making decisions about the daughter's mental health without informing the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they broke up the relationship. \n\nIs the parent justified? On one hand, the parent is protecting their child from what they perceive as a harmful influence. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem intrusive and possibly manipulative, especially taking control of the daughter's mental health without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend supporting this could indicate he's complicit, which adds to the concern.\n\nHowever, the parent made the decision to break them up, which removes the daughter's agency in the relationship. The daughter is 16, so she's a minor, and parents have a duty to protect her, but the method here is extreme. It's possible the parent could have addressed the issues with the boyfriend's mother or sought counseling instead of ending the relationship abruptly. \n\nBut considering the daughter's safety and the described red flags (like the mother taking control of mental health treatment without the parent's input), the parent might have felt compelled to act. The line between protection and overstepping can be blurry here. The boyfriend's role in supporting his mother's actions complicates things further.\n\nIn many cases, parents are advised to communicate and seek solutions rather than dictate outcomes, especially with teenagers. However, when there's a clear threat to the child's well-being, intervention might be necessary. The question is whether breaking up the relationship was the right approach. \n\nI think the parent's intentions were protective, but the method might be questionable. However, given the specific actions of the boyfriend's mother and the boyfriend's support, the parent might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their child's safety. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
