I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The parent has a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy they've known for three years. Initially, everything seemed fine. The boyfriend's mom started acting like a mom to the daughter, calling her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the parent. The boyfriend's mom is pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is supporting this. The parent feels threatened, thinks it's toxic, and breaks them up.\n\nFirst, the parent's actions: They confronted the daughter's boyfriend's mother, who then berated the daughter for telling them. The boyfriend is pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and the mother-in-law's overstepping. The parent steps in to protect their child. \n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, the boyfriend and his mom are overstepping boundaries. The mother is acting as a parent without permission, making medical decisions, and trying to replace the parent. The parent's job is to protect their child, especially from manipulative influences. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has the right to make decisions about her well-being. The parent isn't breaking up the relationship out of jealousy but due to valid concerns about the daughter's safety and mental health. \n\nHowever, maybe the parent didn't give the daughter a chance to handle it herself? But considering the daughter mentioned depression and the mother's actions, the parent intervened to prevent further harm. The boyfriend's involvement in pressuring the move also adds to the toxicity. The parent's actions seem justified to protect their child from a situation that could be emotionally harmful. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
