I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent usually supported the relationship but now has concerns. The boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother figure, making decisions without consulting the parent, and pushing the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels threatened and thinks the relationship is toxic.\n\nFirst, the parent's actions: they intervened after noticing red flags. They told the daughter to break up because they felt the relationship was harmful. The question is whether that was wrong. \n\nThe daughter is a minor, so parental involvement is expected for her safety. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping, possibly manipulative. The boyfriend supports his mother's actions, which could indicate a toxic dynamic. The parent's concern for safety and well-being is valid. Breaking up a minor's relationship isn't done lightly, but if there's evidence of manipulation and neglect, the parent might be justified. \n\nBut maybe the parent could have addressed the issues without breaking them up? Like talking to the other parent or getting the daughter's input. However, given the severity of the red flags\u2014mental health decisions made without consent, pressure to move in\u2014it's a safety issue. \n\nSo, the parent's action, while drastic, aims to protect their child from a potentially harmful situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
