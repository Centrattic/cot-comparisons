I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The parent has no issues with the relationship before, but now the boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother to the daughter, giving her advice, arranging medical appointments without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the daughter and the boyfriend. They're both minors, so the parent has a responsibility to protect the child. The boyfriend's mother is clearly overstepping by taking a parental role. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being and safety. The mother's actions seem controlling and could be harmful. The boyfriend's support of this might indicate he's not protective of his girlfriend but rather enabling his mother's behavior.\n\nThe parent's intervention could be justified because the daughter's mental health is a concern. The mother-in-law arranged an appointment without the parent's consent, which is a red flag. Pressuring a minor to move in is also problematic. The parent is protecting their child from what they perceive as a toxic influence. However, the parent's approach was to break up the relationship, which might be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, especially the safety and well-being concerns, it might be necessary.\n\nI should check if there are any legal aspects. In some places, parents can be involved in their child's decisions if they believe there's harm. The mother-in-law's behavior is inappropriate, so the parent's reaction is protective. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions could be a sign of a larger issue in the relationship. The parent isn't just being overbearing but is responding to real threats. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
