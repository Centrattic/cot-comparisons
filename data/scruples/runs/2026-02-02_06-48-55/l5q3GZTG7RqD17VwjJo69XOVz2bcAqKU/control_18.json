I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for three years. The parent hasn't had issues before but now notices the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing, trying to take on a maternal role, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent. The mother also pressures the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels it's toxic and breaks up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They intervened after observing concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother. The mother's actions\u2014like calling the daughter her \"future daughter,\" making unsolicited parenting critiques, and controlling the daughter's mental health care\u2014could be seen as manipulative. The boyfriend supporting this might make the parent feel their daughter's safety is at risk.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents have the responsibility to protect their children from harmful situations. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent might feel justified in stepping in, especially if they believe the other parent is overstepping. However, breaking up a long-term relationship could be seen as overreach if there's no legal issue involved. But given the described behavior, which includes potential manipulation and neglecting the parent's role, the parent's intervention might be protective rather than harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent should trust their daughter's judgment in a consensual relationship. But the boyfriend's mother's actions seem to go beyond typical parental involvement. The parent's decision is based on observed red flags that could affect the daughter's well-being. So, the parent acting to protect against manipulation and toxic influence might be reasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
