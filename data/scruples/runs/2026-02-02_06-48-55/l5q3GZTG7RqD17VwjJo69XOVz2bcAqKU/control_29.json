I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they did the right thing by breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The main issues come from the boyfriend's mother. She's been acting like a mother figure to the daughter, making comparisons to the parent, arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent, pressuring the daughter to move in, and the boyfriend is supporting this.\n\nThe parent felt these actions were manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their daughter. They intervened by asking the daughter to break up. Now, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the daughter is a minor, so parents have a responsibility to protect her well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping, especially with mental health decisions. The parent has a right to be concerned about their daughter's safety and mental health. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions could indicate a toxic dynamic. Intervening to prevent what they see as a harmful influence might be justified. However, breaking up the relationship directly might be seen as overstepping the parent's role if the daughter is happy and consensual. But given the red flags, the parent's actions could be seen as protective rather than harmful.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's intent was to protect their daughter from what they perceive as a manipulative situation. The boyfriend's mother's actions are concerning, and the parent's intervention is a response to those concerns. Therefore, the parent is likely not in the wrong here.\n"
