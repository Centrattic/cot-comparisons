I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parents were okay with the relationship until now. The boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, making the daughter think she's her future mother, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging therapy without the parent's knowledge. The mom also pressured the daughter to take meds without informing the parent. Plus, they want the daughter to move in with them.\n\nThe parent breaks up the relationship because they see red flags and are worried about their daughter's safety. The question is, are they wrong? \n\nFirst, the daughter is a minor. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from harmful situations. The boyfriend's mother's actions\u2014like making decisions about mental health treatment without the parent's consent\u2014could be problematic. Also, pressuring the daughter to move in is a big deal. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being, which is a valid reason. \n\nBut maybe the parent should have tried to talk to the other mother first or involve authorities instead of breaking up the relationship. However, given that the daughter is still under their care and the potential manipulative behavior, the parent's actions might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, could the parent be overreacting? The boyfriend is 17, but the mother's involvement is more concerning. The parent isn't breaking up the relationship out of jealousy but genuine safety concerns. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong. They're trying to protect their daughter from a potentially toxic and manipulative situation. So the answer is B.\n"
