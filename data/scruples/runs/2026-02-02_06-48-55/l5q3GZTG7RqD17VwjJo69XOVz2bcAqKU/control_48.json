I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent didn't have issues before, but now the boyfriend's mother is acting overly involved. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a therapy appointment without informing the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was manipulative and toxic, so they told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent's actions were justified. The boyfriend's mother's behavior does seem concerning. Taking on a parental role, making medical decisions without the actual parent's consent, and trying to undermine the parent's authority could be signs of overstepping. The boyfriend supporting this might indicate he's part of the dynamic. The parent's concern for their daughter's safety and well-being is a key factor here. While it's important for teens to have relationships, parental protection is also valid, especially if there's evidence of manipulation. The parent didn't act without reason; they observed red flags that justified their intervention. So, the answer is likely B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
