I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The main issue is the boyfriend's mother stepping over boundaries, acting like a parent, and trying to influence the daughter's life. The mother found out the daughter was depressed, and the boyfriend's mom arranged a doctor's appointment without informing the actual parent. She also pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt it was toxic and broke them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, minors can date someone a year their senior, so the age difference isn't the main issue here. The parent has a right to be concerned about their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem manipulative and overstepping. She's trying to replace the daughter's mother, making decisions about her health without consent, and pressuring her to move in. This could be considered emotional abuse or parental alienation.\n\nThe parent's actions were based on protecting their child from what they perceived as a harmful relationship. Even though the daughter was happy, the underlying manipulative behavior by the boyfriend's family could harm her mental health. The parent isn't just being overprotective; there are legitimate red flags. Breaking up the relationship to prevent potential harm isn't necessarily wrong, especially when there's evidence of manipulation and control.\n\nSo, the parent acted out of concern for their daughter's safety. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is problematic, and the parent isn't the one causing the issues. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
