I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent discovered that the boyfriend's mother is acting very much like a mother to the daughter, making her feel like she's replacing the parent. The mother-in-law is giving parenting advice, making decisions about the daughter's mental health without informing the parent, and even pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was toxic and broke them up.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is that the relationship's underbelly is toxic and manipulative, especially with the boyfriend supporting his mother's actions. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The daughter is a minor, so parents have a duty to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping. In some cases, parental involvement can be appropriate, but when it starts to undermine the daughter's own parent, it's concerning. The mother arranging a mental health appointment without informing the daughter's parent and pressuring medication could be a red flag. Also, pressuring the daughter to move in with them might be controlling behavior.\n\nThe parent's action was to break up the relationship based on these concerns. The boyfriend is 17, so he's also a minor, though older. The parent has the right to make decisions regarding their child's safety and well-being. The key points here are the mother's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's complicity. The parent acted out of concern for their child's safety, which is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, breaking up a relationship isn't something to take lightly. The parent should have considered other options first, like talking to the school, involving authorities, or having a mediated conversation. But given the circumstances, especially the mental health aspect and pressure to move in, the parent might feel it's necessary to step in. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, they might not be. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from harmful situations. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem manipulative and overbearing. The boyfriend's support of these actions suggests he's enabling the toxicity. The parent's decision, while extreme, could be justified given the potential risks to the daughter's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parent didn't consult with the daughter or give the boyfriend's family a chance to address their behavior, that could be a problem. But given the information provided, the parent acted to prevent what they saw as a dangerous situation. So I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
