I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent isn't usually against the relationship but noticed concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother. The mother-in-law is acting like a mother figure, making critical comments about the parent's parenting, arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent, and pushing the daughter to move in with them. The boyfriend also supported this, which the parent sees as manipulative and toxic.\n\nFirst, the parent's main concern is the safety and well-being of their daughter. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping boundaries by taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions, which is a red flag. Parents have a duty to protect their children from harmful situations. The mother's actions could be seen as intrusive and potentially harmful, especially if she's pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the parent's justification for stepping in.\n\nHowever, the parent is making a significant decision by breaking up the relationship. They should consider if there's a way to address the issues without ending the relationship, like talking to the boyfriend or his mother. But given the described manipulative behavior and the parent's role in ensuring their daughter's safety, it's understandable why they felt compelled to act. The key points here are the parent's right to protect their child from potential harm and the boyfriend family's overreach. The parent isn't just acting out of jealousy but genuine concern for their daughter's well-being. So, the answer is B\u2014the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
