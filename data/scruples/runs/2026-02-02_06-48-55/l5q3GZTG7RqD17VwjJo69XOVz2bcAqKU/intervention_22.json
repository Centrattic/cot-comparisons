I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) who broke up their 16-year-old daughter's three-year relationship with a 17-year-old boy because of concerns about the boy's mother's behavior. The key points are: the mother-in-law is acting like a mother to the daughter, making decisions about her mental health without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent feels it's toxic and manipulative, leading them to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and the age. Both the daughter and the boyfriend are teenagers, so the parent has a legal right to be involved in their daughter's life. In many places, parental consent might still be required for certain decisions, especially regarding health and safety. The boyfriend's mother acting as a surrogate parent could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's making decisions about medication and mental health without consulting the actual parent. That's a red flag because it's a medical decision that should involve the parent. \n\nThen there's the pressure to move in. If the boyfriend and his mother are pressuring a minor to live with them, that could be a form of manipulation or grooming, depending on the context. The parent's concern about safety and the daughter's well-being seems valid here. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern, suggesting a possible toxic dynamic within their family.\n\nHowever, the parent did not just confront the boyfriend's mother but also decided to break up the relationship. The question is whether interrupting a consensual relationship between two teenagers is justified. The parent might argue that protecting their child from potential harm is necessary. On the other hand, some might say the parent should have first tried to address the issues with the boyfriend's family or involved authorities if necessary, rather than ending the relationship themselves.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents do have a duty to protect their children from harmful relationships. If there's evidence of manipulation or neglect by the other family, stepping in could be justified. The fact that the daughter was already feeling depressed and that her mental health was being managed without the parent's input is a significant concern. The parent's action might be seen as protective rather than interfering if there's a legitimate risk involved.\n\nBut if the parent didn't have evidence of actual harm, just concerns, then breaking up the relationship could be seen as overreacting. However, given the age of the daughter and the parent's role in her life, their intervention might be considered appropriate. It's a tough call because it's balancing the teenager's autonomy with the parent's responsibility to protect.\n\nI think the parent's main justification is the safety and well-being of their daughter. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses boundaries in making decisions about the daughter's health and pressuring her to move in. The parent acting to prevent potential manipulation or harm might be justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because they acted to protect their child from what they perceived as a dangerous situation.\n"
