I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mother is acting overly involved\u2014calling herself the daughter's future mother, criticizing how the parent raised the daughter, arranging mental health appointments without consulting the parent, and even pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt it was toxic and decided to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. As a parent, their main concern is their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping. She's taking a parental role without the parent's consent, making medical decisions, and possibly manipulating the family dynamics. The boyfriend is supporting this, which adds to the concern.\n\nThe parent isn't just being overprotective here. The actions of the boyfriend's mother could be harmful. The daughter's mental health being managed by someone else without the parent's input is a big red flag. Also, the pressure to move in might be a form of control. The parent is reacting to protect their daughter from what they perceive as a toxic influence.\n\nBut wait, is the parent right to intervene? In some cases, parents might overreact, but in this scenario, the boyfriend's mother's actions seem invasive. The parent has a right to be concerned about their child's safety and mental health. The fact that the daughter reported feeling depressed and the mother-in-law took it upon herself to handle it without informing the parent shows a lack of respect for the parent's role.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's support of his mother's actions makes the situation more troubling. The parent isn't breaking up the relationship out of jealousy but out of genuine safety concerns. So, the parent's action seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
