I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent initially had no issues with the relationship. The boyfriend's mom has been acting very motherly towards the daughter, calling her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a therapy appointment without the parent's knowledge. The daughter felt depressed, and the boyfriend's mom took control of her mental health care, telling her to take prescribed meds. The boyfriend's mom also pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent confronted the boyfriend's mom, who then made the boyfriend upset with the daughter for telling. The parent then told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend because they felt the situation was toxic and manipulative, fearing for the daughter's safety.\n\nSo the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The main issues here are the boyfriend's mother overstepping her role, taking on a parental role, making decisions about the daughter's mental health without consulting the actual parent, and the parent stepping in to end the relationship. The parent is concerned about their daughter's well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and appropriateness of the mother's actions. The daughter is a minor, so her parent is the legal guardian. The boyfriend's mom arranging therapy and pushing medication without the parent's consent might be a problem. Also, the boyfriend's mom's comments about the parent's parenting and trying to replace her could be seen as undermining the parent's role. \n\nThe parent's decision to end the relationship is based on these red flags. But is that overstepping? The parent is acting out of concern for their child's safety. While the boyfriend and his mother are in their home, they shouldn't be making decisions about the daughter's health without the parent's knowledge. The parent has the right to protect their child from potentially harmful influences. \n\nHowever, breaking up a three-year relationship is a big step. The parent might have considered other options first, like talking to the boyfriend's mom, involving authorities if necessary, or the daughter seeking therapy independently. But given the situation described, the parent felt it was necessary to protect their daughter. \n\nIn terms of the parent's actions, they are acting as any concerned parent would. The boyfriend's mom's behavior is the main issue here. The parent isn't the one acting in a parental role for someone else's child. They are protecting their own. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. Did the parent give the boyfriend and his mom a chance to address the issues? The parent did confront the boyfriend's mom, but she retaliated. The parent's actions are justified due to the daughter's safety. Yeah, I think the parent is right to intervene here.\n"
