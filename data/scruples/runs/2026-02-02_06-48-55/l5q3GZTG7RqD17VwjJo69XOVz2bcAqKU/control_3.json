I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mother who broke up her daughter's 3-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The mother had no issues before, but now she's noticed the boyfriend's mother acting strangely. She's calling her daughter her future daughter, criticizing the mother's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the mother. The boyfriend's mom is pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is supporting this. The mother feels it's toxic and manipulative, so she told her daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the kids. They're both teenagers, so their judgment might not be fully developed. The boyfriend's mother is acting in a way that seems to overstep boundaries. By calling the daughter her future daughter and taking over her healthcare decisions, that's definitely concerning. The mother's actions here are trying to insert herself into the daughter's life in a parent role, which is not appropriate. The boyfriend's involvement in supporting this could indicate that he's not standing up for his girlfriend's autonomy.\n\nThe mother, as a parent, has a responsibility to protect her daughter from potential harm. The situation does present multiple red flags: manipulation, pressure to move in, and undermining the mother's role. The mother's decision might stem from fear for her daughter's safety and well-being. However, breaking up a long-term relationship is a big step. But given the manipulative behavior of the boyfriend's mother and his support, it's understandable. The key here is whether the mother acted in good faith to protect her child. Since the daughter is still a minor, the mother has the right to intervene if she sees signs of toxicity. So, the mother isn't in the wrong here; she's trying to shield her daughter from a harmful situation.\n"
