I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent is okay with the relationship but then discovers some concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother. The mother is acting like a parent to the daughter, making her feel like she's taking over, even arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent feels this is toxic and breaks up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They intervened because they were worried about their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem overstepping. She's trying to parent the daughter without the consent of the actual parent, which can be seen as manipulative. The boyfriend supports this, which adds to the concern. The parent has a responsibility to protect their child, especially from potential harm. Even though the daughter is a teenager, the parent is acting in her best interest based on the red flags they observed.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother's behavior includes taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions, which is a significant issue. Parents typically have the right to make decisions about their child's health and safety. The parent's decision to end the relationship because of these manipulative tactics seems justified. There's no indication that the parent acted out of jealousy or without cause. The daughter's feelings of depression and being pressured to move in are serious concerns. The parent's intervention is a protective measure, not an overreach. So, the answer is likely B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
