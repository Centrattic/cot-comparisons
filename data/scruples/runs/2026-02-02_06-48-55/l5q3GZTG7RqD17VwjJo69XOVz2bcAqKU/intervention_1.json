I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship because of the boyfriend's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. They've been together for over three years. The parents were initially okay with the relationship. But then the boyfriend's mother starts acting like a mother figure to the daughter. She tells the daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her future daughter, critiques the parent's parenting, and even arranges a therapy appointment without the parent's knowledge. The mother also pressures the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they tell the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nThe user initially thought the parent is in the wrong but is now unsure. I need to figure out if the parent acted correctly. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe main issue is the boyfriend's mother's overstepping. She's taking on a parental role, making decisions without the parent's input, and trying to undermine the parent's authority. The daughter is being influenced in a way that the parent sees as harmful. The parent's concern is valid because the mother-in-law's actions could be emotionally manipulative. The boyfriend supports his mother, which adds to the parent's concern about toxicity in the relationship.\n\nNow, the parent's action was to break up the relationship. Is that justified? Well, the parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's safety and well-being. The mother's actions could be seen as controlling or manipulative. Even though the relationship between the daughter and boyfriend was previously okay, the new elements introduced by the boyfriend's mother might create a harmful environment. The parent is not just reacting to their own child's behavior but to external factors that could be affecting their daughter negatively.\n\nHowever, breaking up a teenager's long-term relationship is a big step. The parent should consider if they have the daughter's input or if they're making the decision without understanding her perspective. But given that the daughter mentioned feeling depressed and the mother's interference, maybe the parent felt it was necessary to protect her.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue the parent overstepped, assuming the daughter can't handle the situation. But considering the manipulative behavior from the other mother, the parent's actions could be protective. So, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong here. The key is whether the parent had reasonable grounds to believe the relationship was harmful. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions also plays a role in making the relationship toxic.\n\nSo, the parent's decision might be justified as a protective measure against a manipulative influence. Therefore, the answer would be B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
