I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship was in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent didn't have issues before. Now, the boyfriend's mother has been acting like a mother figure to the daughter, calling her \"future daughter,\" criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge. She also pressured the daughter to take medication and suggested moving in with them. The boyfriend supported his mother's actions, and the parent, feeling the relationship is toxic and manipulative, broke them up.\n\nHmm. So the parent is concerned about the mother-in-law's behavior towards their daughter. The key points here are the mother's overstepping\u2014acting as a parent, making decisions without the parent's consent, and possibly undermining the parent's authority. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions is also a red flag, as he's not standing up for his girlfriend's boundaries with his family.\n\nIn the US, parents generally have the right to make decisions regarding their minor children's well-being. If the parent believes the boyfriend's mother is being manipulative or harmful, stepping in to protect the daughter seems justified. However, breaking up the relationship might be a heavy-handed approach. But considering the situation described\u2014pressuring medication, moving in, and undermining the parent\u2014it could be seen as a necessary step to protect the child from a toxic dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent overreacted without giving the couple a chance to resolve the issues or that the daughter is old enough to make her own choices. But since the daughter is only 16, her judgment might not be fully formed, especially if there's potential mental health involvement. The parent's role here is to safeguard their child's well-being.\n\nSo, based on the information, the parent's actions, while extreme, seem to be in response to what they perceive as a threat to their daughter's safety and mental health. The key factors are the mother's inappropriate interference and the boyfriend's support of it. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
