I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent usually supports the relationship but recently found some concerning behaviors from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They discovered that the boyfriend's mother is trying to take over the parenting role, calling the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizing the parent's methods, and even arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent. The mother also pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent then told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend because they felt it was toxic and manipulative.\n\nNow, the key points here are the parent's role in their child's life. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, especially minors. Even though teenagers can have relationships, parents need to intervene if there's a risk to the child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem overstepping. She's not just being a supportive figure but is actively undermining the parent's authority and making decisions that should involve the parent, like mental health treatment. This could create a toxic environment where the daughter is being manipulated against her own parent.\n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern. The parent's decision to end the relationship is based on protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a harmful dynamic. Even if the couple is happy on the surface, the underlying issues could be harmful in the long run. It's about the parent's duty to safeguard their child's emotional and mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is overstepping by breaking up the relationship. But considering the mother-in-law's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's complicity, the parent's actions are a protective measure. There's a risk of emotional manipulation and potential harm, which justifies the intervention. The parent isn't just acting on suspicion but has observed specific red flags that indicate a problematic situation.\n\nSo, the answer seems to be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting in their child's best interest to prevent potential harm from a toxic relationship dynamic.\n"
