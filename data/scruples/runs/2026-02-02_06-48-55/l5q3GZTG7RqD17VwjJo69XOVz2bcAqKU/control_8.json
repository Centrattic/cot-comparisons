I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parents had no issues before, but now the boyfriend's mom is acting in ways that concern the parent.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mom is telling the daughter to see her as a mother, calling her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and making decisions about her mental health without consulting the parent. That's a lot. The mom arranged an appointment for depression, prescribed meds, and pressured the daughter. The parent feels this is overstepping, and the boyfriend is supporting this. Also, they're pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent breaks up the relationship because they see red flags and fear for her safety.\n\nSo, the parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being. The actions of the boyfriend's mom seem intrusive and possibly manipulative. The parent isn't just being overprotective; there are specific behaviors that could be harmful. The boyfriend's support of his mom's actions suggests he's part of the issue. The parent isn't preventing a healthy relationship but intervening due to potential toxicity. Legally, the parent has authority until the daughter is an adult, but she's 16, so maybe the boyfriend's mom is overstepping boundaries. The parent's actions seem justified to protect their child. So, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
