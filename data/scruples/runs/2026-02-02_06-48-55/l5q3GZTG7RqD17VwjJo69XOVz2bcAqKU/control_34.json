I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent didn't have issues before but now notices the boyfriend's mom acting like a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. As a parent, their primary concern is the child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping\u2014taking on a parental role, making decisions without the parent's knowledge, and possibly undermining the parent's authority. That could create a toxic dynamic. The boyfriend supporting this might indicate he's complicit. The parent's decision to intervene is based on protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a harmful situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent didn't provide evidence of the daughter being directly harmed, just the mother-in-law's actions. However, the daughter did mention feeling depressed, which the boyfriend's mother addressed without the parent's knowledge. This could be a sign of manipulation or undue influence. The pressure to move in with them adds another layer. \n\nI think the parent is acting in their daughter's best interest, trying to shield her from a potentially toxic influence. The boyfriend's mother's actions cross boundaries typical of a parent-child relationship, and the boyfriend's support suggests he's not protecting his girlfriend's autonomy. So the parent's intervention is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
