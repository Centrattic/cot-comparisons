I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent has been okay with it until recently when the boyfriend's mom started acting like a mother figure to the daughter. The mom is giving parenting advice, criticizing how the parent raised the daughter, and even arranging a psychiatrist appointment for her without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend's mom is pushing the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend supports this. The parent feels this is toxic and a threat to their relationship with their daughter, so they broke up the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The key points here are the parent's concern for their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mom's actions seem overstepping. Arranging medical appointments without parental consent is a big red flag. Also, trying to position herself as the daughter's mother and undermining the parent's authority could be harmful. The parent is acting to protect their daughter from what they see as manipulation and toxicity. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has a responsibility to ensure her safety and well-being. The boyfriend's involvement in supporting his mother's actions adds to the concern.\n\nIn such cases, parents are generally expected to intervene if they believe their child is in a harmful situation. The boyfriend's family's behavior crosses boundaries that could be detrimental to the daughter's mental health and family relationships. The parent isn't just being controlling but is responding to specific harmful actions. So the answer is likely B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
