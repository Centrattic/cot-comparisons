I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's 3-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The parent didn't have issues before but now is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The mother seems to be overstepping, acting like a mother figure, making medical decisions, and pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent confronted the mother, who then told the son to berate the daughter for telling the parent. The parent then told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent acted appropriately. The mother-in-law's actions do raise red flags: controlling behavior, undermining the parent, making medical decisions without consent. The parent's concern for safety is valid. However, the parent took the step of breaking up the relationship. Is that justified?\n\nIn many cases, parents have a right to protect their children from harmful influences. If there's evidence of manipulation or danger, intervention might be necessary. However, the daughter is 16, which is an age where she's developing autonomy. The parent's actions could be seen as overstepping if the daughter isn't being given a say. However, the boyfriend's role in supporting his mother's actions is problematic. The parent might feel that the boyfriend is complicit, making the relationship unhealthy.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Breaking up a long-term relationship is a major step. The parent's reasons are safety concerns, which are important. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is concerning, but does that justify the parent's intervention? It depends on the jurisdiction and cultural norms, but generally, parents have a duty to protect their children. However, the method of breaking up might be seen as extreme. The parent should have perhaps spoken to the boyfriend's parents or sought mediation first. But given the situation, the parent might believe the risk is too high.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? I think not. The red flags are significant. The mother's actions are inappropriate and could be harmful. The parent's intervention aims to protect the daughter. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
