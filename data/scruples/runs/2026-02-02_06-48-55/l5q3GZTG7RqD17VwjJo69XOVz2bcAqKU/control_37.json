I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent had no issues until recently when the boyfriend's mother started acting overbearing. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, critiquing the parent's parenting, arranging therapy without their knowledge, and pushing the daughter to move in with them. The parent confronted the mother, but she involved the son, who reprimanded the daughter. The parent then ended the relationship due to these red flags.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The parent's main concern is the other mother's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's support of it. The daughter is under 18, so the parent has a legal and moral duty to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem intrusive and possibly abusive, crossing boundaries by taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions. The boyfriend's support suggests he's not protecting his girlfriend but enabling the mother's behavior.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to protect their children from harmful situations. The mother in question is acting beyond a parental role, which can be considered emotional manipulation or even emotional abuse. The parent's intervention could be justified as protective. However, breaking up a three-year relationship might be seen as overstepping if the daughter is happy, but given the red flags, it's a safety measure.\n\nThe key factors here are the daughter's safety and well-being. The parent isn't just acting on jealousy but on legitimate concerns about another adult's inappropriate influence. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be considered grooming or emotional manipulation, which is serious. The parent's decision to end the relationship is a response to protect their child from potential harm.\n\nConsidering all these points, the parent is acting in their child's best interest. The other mother's behavior is problematic and the boyfriend's support exacerbates the issue. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong; they're taking necessary steps to safeguard their daughter.\n"
