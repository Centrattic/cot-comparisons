I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter and her 17-year-old boyfriend. The main issues are the boyfriend's mother acting overstepping, inserting herself into the daughter's life, and pressuring her to move in with them. The parent felt these actions were manipulative and a threat to their daughter's well-being, so they ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They observed concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother, like calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing parenting, and taking control of the daughter's mental health treatment without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend supported this, and there was pressure to move in. The parent acted out of concern for their daughter's safety and well-being. \n\nLegally, the parent has the right to protect their minor child. The daughter is 16, so she's still a minor, and the parents are responsible for her welfare. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem overbearing and possibly manipulative, which could be harmful. The parent's decision might be seen as a protective measure rather than interference. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent shouldn't have intervened without the daughter's consent or without giving the boyfriend a chance to address the issues. However, given the potential toxicity and the parent's legitimate concerns, their actions seem reasonable. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern about a toxic dynamic. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong because they acted to protect their daughter from what they perceived as a harmful situation. The answer should be B (No).\n"
