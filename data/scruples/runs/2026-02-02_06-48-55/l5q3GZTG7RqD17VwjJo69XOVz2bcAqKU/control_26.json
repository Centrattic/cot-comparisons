I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The mom found out the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, criticizing how she raised her daughter, arranging therapy without informing the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent confronted the situation and ended the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the parent's actions. The boyfriend's mom's behavior seems overstepping\u2014acting as a substitute parent, making medical decisions without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend supports this, which adds to the concern. The parent is worried about her daughter's well-being and safety.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, minors can consent to their own relationships, but parents have a responsibility to protect them from harmful situations. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be considered manipulative or even illegal if she's making medical decisions without proper authority. The parent stepping in to protect her daughter from what she perceives as toxic and manipulative behavior might be justified.\n\nHowever, breaking up a three-year relationship could be seen as overstepping if there are no actual legal violations, just parental concerns. But given the described red flags\u2014control over the daughter's health, moving in pressure, undermining the parent\u2014it's a protective measure. \n\nThe key points are the parent acting in her daughter's best interest and the other parent's (boyfriend's mom) potential overreach. The boyfriend's support of his mom's actions makes the situation more concerning. So, the parent's decision might be seen as necessary to prevent harm. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
