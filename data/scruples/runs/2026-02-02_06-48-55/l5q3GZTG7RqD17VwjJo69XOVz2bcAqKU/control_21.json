I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parent is concerned because the boy's mother is acting inappropriately, trying to take over the parent's role, pressuring the daughter, and possibly manipulating her. The parent intervened by asking the daughter to break up with the boy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. As a parent, their primary concern is the safety and well-being of their child. The boyfriend's mother's actions\u2014criticizing the parent's parenting, acting as a surrogate mother, arranging medical appointments without consulting the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them\u2014could be seen as overstepping and potentially harmful. The mother's behavior might be enabling a toxic dynamic where the daughter is being manipulated into turning against her own parent.\n\nHowever, the daughter is of age where she can make her own decisions, even though she's a minor. The parents have a right to be concerned, especially if there's evidence of manipulation or harm. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern, suggesting a possible toxic influence. The parent's action to end the relationship could be seen as protective, especially given the age of the daughter and the potential for emotional manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is overstepping by breaking up the relationship. The daughter and boyfriend were in a long-term relationship, and the parent's intervention might be seen as undermining the daughter's autonomy. However, given the circumstances\u2014the mother-in-law's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's complicity\u2014the parent's actions might be justified as a necessary step to protect their child from a potentially harmful situation.\n\nI should also consider if there's any evidence that the parent acted without sufficient cause. The parent observed multiple red flags and the daughter's report of depression, which the boyfriend's mother took advantage of. The pressure to move in and the undermining of the parent's role are significant concerns. In such cases, parents have a right to intervene when they perceive a threat to their child's well-being.\n\nTherefore, the parent's decision, while possibly harsh, is likely motivated by genuine concern for their daughter's safety and mental health. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
