I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves their 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parent is happy with the relationship, but recently found out about the boyfriend's mother acting in a controlling way towards the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and maturity of the daughter. At 16, she's a minor, so parents have a responsibility to ensure her safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother is telling the daughter to think of her as her mother, arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. This seems like overstepping boundaries, possibly manipulative behavior. The parent is reacting to these red flags, which are concerning because they might indicate that the boyfriend and his mother are trying to undermine the parent's role.\n\nThe parent approached their daughter, who then told the boyfriend, leading to the boyfriend berating her. The boyfriend's mother is also involved in pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent's actions are based on fear for their child's safety, which is a valid concern. They're trying to protect their daughter from someone who might be toxic or manipulative in the relationship, even if the boyfriend himself is okay. \n\nBut wait, is the parent justifying breaking up the relationship purely based on the mother's actions? The parent isn't objecting to the boyfriend himself but the influence the boyfriend's mother is having. The daughter might be confused because the boyfriend is a part of this dynamic. It's possible that the mother is using the relationship to gain control, which is a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nIn such cases, parents have a right to intervene if they perceive threats to their child's well-being. The key factor here is the safety and mental health of the daughter. The boyfriend's mother is acting in a way that's intrusive and possibly harmful, so the parent's decision to ask for a breakup might be a protective measure. The fact that the parent has a history of being supportive but now sees these red flags could mean their concern is reasonable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent is overreacting or not giving the daughter enough autonomy. But since the daughter is underage, parents are expected to be more involved. Also, the mother's actions include arranging medical appointments and pressuring for cohabitation, which are significant. The boyfriend's support of this behavior adds to the concern. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent isn't in the wrong because they're acting in their child's best interest based on observed harmful behavior from the boyfriend's mother and the boyfriend's complicity. The answer should be B (No).\n"
