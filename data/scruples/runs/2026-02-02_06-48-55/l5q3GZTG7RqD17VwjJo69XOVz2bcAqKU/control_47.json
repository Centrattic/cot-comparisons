I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. Let me try to work through this.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent has been okay with the relationship until recently. The main issues now are with the boyfriend's mother. She's been acting like a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without the parent's knowledge. The mother also wants the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nHmm, the parent is concerned about their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem overstepping. Telling the daughter to move in, making medical decisions without the parent's input, and trying to undermine the parent's authority could be signs of a toxic influence. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's safety and mental health. \n\nBut wait, the parent is the one who ended the relationship. Is that appropriate? At 16, the daughter is a minor, so parents have a right to be involved in decisions affecting her well-being. However, the parent should consider talking to the daughter directly about their concerns instead of just ending the relationship. But given the situation described, where the boyfriend and his mother are pressuring the daughter and acting inappropriately, the parent's action might be justified. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their child from a potentially harmful situation. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is concerning, and the parent's intervention is a response to protect their daughter. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
