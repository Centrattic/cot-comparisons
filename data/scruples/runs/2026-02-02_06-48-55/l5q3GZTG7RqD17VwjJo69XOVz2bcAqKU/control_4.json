I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong here. The parent's daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent hasn't had issues before. Now, the boyfriend's mom is acting very involved, almost like a parent. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a therapy appointment without telling the parent, pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is supporting this.\n\nThe parent is worried this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up. The question is if the parent is wrong to do that. \n\nFirst, the parent's concern is about their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mom is overstepping, making decisions that should be the parent's role. The daughter is showing signs of depression, and the other mom is taking control without involving the parent. That's a red flag. Manipulation and trying to replace the parent could be harmful. \n\nThe parent isn't just acting on a hunch; they've observed several concerning behaviors. The boyfriend is involved in supporting his mom's actions. Breaking up might be a protective measure. Legally, the parents are the legal guardians, so they have a right to ensure their child's safety. \n\nBut some might argue that the parent is overreacting or interfering in the relationship. However, given the described behaviors\u2014control, manipulation, and undermining the parent's role\u2014it seems like a valid concern. The parent isn't just breaking up because of jealousy but because of actual harmful actions. \n\nSo the parent's actions are justified to protect their child. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
