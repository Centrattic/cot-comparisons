I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent intervening in their daughter's relationship because of the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, and they've been dating for three years. The parent is concerned because the boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother figure, making critical comments about the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent then told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, especially teenagers, from harmful situations. The mother of the boyfriend seems to be overstepping boundaries by acting as a maternal figure, making decisions without the parent's consent, and possibly manipulating the situation. The fact that the boyfriend supports his mother's actions adds to the concern about toxicity.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is an adolescent, and relationships can be complex. However, the boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory, which a parent might reasonably see as a threat to their child's well-being. The parent's decision to intervene is based on protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a manipulative and toxic environment. \n\nThere's no indication that the parent acted recklessly or without cause. The red flags mentioned are significant: interference in the daughter's health decisions, undermining the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in. Given these factors, the parent's action to break up the relationship might be justified as protective. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, as they are acting in their child's best interest based on the described circumstances.\n"
