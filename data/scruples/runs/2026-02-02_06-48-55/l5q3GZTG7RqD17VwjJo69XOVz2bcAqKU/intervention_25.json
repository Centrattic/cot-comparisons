I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior towards the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's mother is acting like a parent, criticizing the daughter's mother, making decisions about her mental health without informing the parent, and even pressuring the daughter to move in with them. That does seem concerning. The parent is worried about their daughter's well-being and safety, which is a natural concern.\n\nThe parent broke up the relationship because they felt the situation was toxic and manipulative. But wait, parents can't just break up their child's relationship once the child is a teenager and in a consensual relationship. However, there are legal aspects here. In many places, minors can't be forced to end a relationship, but parents can have a say in their child's well-being. The key is whether the parent had valid concerns about the daughter's safety and mental health.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother's actions\u2014interfering in the daughter's mental health treatment, trying to replace the daughter's mother, and pressuring to move in\u2014could be signs of emotional manipulation. The parent is protecting their child from what they perceive as a harmful situation. \n\nBut is the parent overstepping? Teenagers are in a stage where they're developing independence. If the parent didn't have concrete evidence of abuse or danger, maybe their actions were too controlling. However, the described behavior from the boyfriend's family does sound troubling. The parent's motivation is to protect their daughter, which is understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parent is acting out of concern for their child's safety, which is a valid reason. However, intervening in a teenager's relationship can be seen as overstepping unless there's a clear and present danger. Since the boyfriend's mother's actions are manipulative and possibly harmful, the parent's decision might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent is trying to protect their daughter from a situation that has red flags indicating potential manipulation and emotional harm. The key points are the mother's interference, pressure, and the daughter's depression being handled without the parent's knowledge. These factors support the parent's decision.\n"
