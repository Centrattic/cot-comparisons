I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. They've been together for over three years, and the parent has been happy with the relationship. The boyfriend's mom has been acting in a way that's concerning. She calls the daughter her future daughter, critiques the parent's parenting, and even arranged a mental health appointment for the daughter without telling the parent. The boyfriend supported his mom, and they pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent then decided to ask the daughter to break up with him due to safety concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent noticed red flags in how the boyfriend's mother is involved in their daughter's life. The mother's behavior seems overbearing and possibly manipulative. For example, taking charge of a mental health appointment without consulting the parent is a big issue. In many places, even if a minor is involved, a parent is typically informed or involved in medical decisions. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests he's complicit in this.\n\nThe parent's main concern is the safety and well-being of their daughter. They felt the situation was toxic and manipulative, leading them to intervene. But is that the parent's right? Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, especially when they see potential harm. However, breaking up a three-year relationship is a significant step. The parent's decision might be seen as overstepping if there's no concrete evidence of harm. But given the described behaviors\u2014gaslighting, undermining the parent's authority, and pressuring the daughter to move in\u2014it seems like there are valid concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 16 and in a high school relationship. The parent's involvement might be seen as necessary due to the daughter's age and the potential influence of the boyfriend's family. The boyfriend's mom acting as a surrogate parent and making medical decisions without the parent's consent crosses boundaries. The boyfriend's support of this could indicate a lack of respect for the parent's role.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? If the parent had concrete evidence of harm, their intervention is justified. However, if the parent acted on suspicion without sufficient proof, it could be seen as overreaching. But the described actions by the boyfriend's mother\u2014like arranging appointments and pressuring the daughter\u2014do seem like red flags. The parent is acting to protect their child, which is a parent's duty. So, the answer is likely B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
