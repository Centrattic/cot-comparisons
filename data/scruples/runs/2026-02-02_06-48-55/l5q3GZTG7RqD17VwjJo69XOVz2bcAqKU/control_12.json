I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's long-term relationship was in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent didn't have issues before, but now the boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother figure to the daughter. She's giving parenting advice, arranging medical appointments without consulting the parent, and even trying to get the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was manipulative and a threat to their relationship, so they told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping boundaries, taking on a parental role, and possibly manipulating the daughter. The boyfriend is complicit by not addressing his mother's actions and even berating the daughter for telling her parent. \n\nLegally, the parent has the right to make decisions for their minor child. The daughter is 16, still a minor, so the parent's intervention could be justified to protect her from potential harm. The mother-in-law's behavior is concerning\u2014interfering in medical decisions, trying to move in with them, and undermining the parent's authority. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests that the relationship might be enabling this behavior.\n\nThe parent's actions were based on red flags that indicate possible manipulation and a loss of parental control. While breaking up a teenager's long-term relationship is a big step, the parent's primary responsibility is to their child's safety and well-being. In this case, the parent acted to prevent what they saw as an abusive dynamic. \n\nThere's no indication that the parent acted without reason. The boyfriend's mother's actions were documented, and the boyfriend wasn't supportive. The daughter's depression being addressed without the parent's knowledge is a red flag. So, the parent's decision seems justified to protect their daughter from a toxic situation.\n"
