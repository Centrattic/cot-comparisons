I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship with a 17-year-old boyfriend. The daughter is 16, so they're both teenagers. The main issues are the boyfriend's mother acting overly involved, trying to take a maternal role, pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and making decisions without the parent's knowledge. The parent felt these were red flags and a threat to their daughter's safety, so they intervened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have the legal right to make decisions for their minor children, especially regarding relationships and safety. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems manipulative and overstepping. She's essentially trying to replace the parent, which is concerning. The daughter's mental health being addressed without the parent's involvement is another red flag. The parent's concern for their daughter's safety and well-being is valid here.\n\nHowever, the relationship itself has been ongoing for three years, and the parent didn't have issues before. The breaking point was the boyfriend's mother's actions. The parent's decision might be seen as overprotective, but given the described manipulative behavior, it's a protective measure. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the problem. \n\nI should check if there's any law or guideline that would make the parent's action wrong. In some cases, parents intervening in their child's relationships might be controversial, but when there's evidence of manipulation or potential harm, it's often justified. The parent isn't just breaking up the relationship out of jealousy but due to genuine concerns for their daughter's safety and mental health. \n\nSo, considering all the points, the parent is acting in their daughter's best interest. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
