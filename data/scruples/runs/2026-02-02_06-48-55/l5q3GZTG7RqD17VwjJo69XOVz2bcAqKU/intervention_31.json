I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mother has been acting overbearing, trying to take over the role of a mother, and even arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent. The boyfriend's mom is also pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was toxic and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are minors, so the parent's role is to protect their child. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem to overstep. She's taking on a parental role without the parent's consent, which is concerning. The parent's concern is about safety and the daughter's well-being. The key here is that the boyfriend's mother is making decisions that should be the parent's responsibility, like mental health treatments. That's a red flag for potential manipulation or control. \n\nThe boyfriend is part of this by supporting his mother's actions. The parent has the right to step in if they believe their child is in a harmful situation. The parent didn't just confront the boyfriend's mother; they addressed the daughter directly and then decided to break up the relationship because of the toxic elements. \n\nI should also think about the legal aspect. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has legal authority to make decisions regarding her welfare. The boyfriend's mother's interference could be seen as inappropriate, especially involving mental health. The parent's actions are protective, not just controlling. \n\nThe user thinks the parent is in the wrong, but from this analysis, the parent is acting in their child's best interest. The boyfriend's family is crossing boundaries, and the parent is justified in intervening. So the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
