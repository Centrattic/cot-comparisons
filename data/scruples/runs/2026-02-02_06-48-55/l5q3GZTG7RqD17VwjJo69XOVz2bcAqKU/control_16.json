I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy. The main concerns are the boyfriend's mother overstepping by acting as a mother figure, making decisions about the daughter's mental health without consulting the actual parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent then intervenes by telling their daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. As a parent, it's their responsibility to protect their child from potential harm. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem manipulative and overbearing. She's taking on a parental role, which is unusual since the parents are typically the ones in that role. The mother arranging mental health appointments without the parent's knowledge and dictating medication is concerning. This could be a form of gaslighting or trying to alienate the daughter from her real parents. Also, pressuring the daughter to move in with them adds another layer of red flags, possibly indicating an attempt to exert more control.\n\nThe boyfriend's involvement is also a factor. If he's supporting his mother's actions, that suggests he might not be protecting his girlfriend's well-being. The parent's decision to intervene is based on these red flags, which they perceive as toxic and manipulative. While the relationship might have been otherwise healthy, the influence of the boyfriend's mother introduces elements that could be harmful.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the parent overstepped. The daughter is 16, so she's a minor, and parents do have a legal right to make decisions on her behalf if they believe there's a threat to her safety. The key here is whether the parent's actions were justified given the circumstances. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses boundaries that are typically not appropriate for an adult to a teenager. The parent's concern is valid because the mother's actions could lead to emotional manipulation and harm.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's autonomy. If the daughter is old enough to date, some might argue she should be allowed to make her own decisions. But given the manipulative environment created by the boyfriend's mother, the parent's intervention might be necessary to prevent further harm. The parent isn't just acting on jealousy but on observed behaviors that could be detrimental to their child's well-being.\n\nIn summary, the parent's actions are a response to clear red flags that indicate potential emotional manipulation and control. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is inappropriate, and her influence could be harmful. The parent is acting in their child's best interest by protecting her from a toxic environment. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
