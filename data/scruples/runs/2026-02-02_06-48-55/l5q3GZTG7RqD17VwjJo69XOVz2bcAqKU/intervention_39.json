I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The situation is pretty complex. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nThe daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent initially supported the relationship. Then, issues started arising with the boyfriend's mother. She's been calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent, pressuring the daughter to move in, and the boyfriend is supportive of these actions. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, leading them to ask the daughter to break up.\n\nSo, the parent's main concerns are the boyfriend's mother overstepping her role, acting as a parent figure, and potentially undermining the parent's authority. The parent is worried about their daughter's well-being and safety. The boyfriend is involved in the actions, which is a red flag.\n\nThe parent's action was to intervene and break up the relationship. Now, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's right to be involved in their child's well-being. Since the daughter is a minor, parents have a legal and moral responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's behavior does seem concerning\u2014taking on a parental role without consent, making medical decisions, and possibly isolating the daughter from her biological parent. The boyfriend's support for this behavior is also problematic because he should respect the parent's role.\n\nHowever, the parent's method of intervention is to break up the relationship. But the daughter is 16, and relationships are a part of growing up. The parent might have other options, like talking to the other parents, involving school authorities, or counseling. Breaking up the relationship directly might not be the best approach, but the parent's intention is to protect their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is responding to what they perceive as threats to their daughter's safety and mental health. If the mother-in-law was genuinely manipulating or exploiting the situation, the parent's concern is valid. The key here is whether the parent overstepped in their response. While the mother-in-law's actions are troubling, the parent's decision to end the relationship could be seen as necessary to protect their child.\n\nBut the question is about whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent is acting in their child's best interest based on the observed behaviors. The boyfriend's mother's actions and the boyfriend's support do cross boundaries. The parent is within their rights to be concerned and take action to protect their daughter. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong here. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
