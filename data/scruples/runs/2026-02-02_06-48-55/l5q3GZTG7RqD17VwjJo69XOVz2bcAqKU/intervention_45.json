I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship with a 17-year-old boyfriend. The daughter is 16, they've been dating for three years, and the parent has generally been okay with the relationship. The issue comes when the boyfriend's mother starts acting overbearing: telling the daughter to think of her as her mother, making decisions about her mental health without consulting the parent, and pressuring her to move in. The parent confronts them and the boyfriend gets angry, leading the parent to ask the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent's actions were justified. The key points here are the mother's behavior, the parent's response, and the potential harm involved. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping by taking a maternal role and making decisions about the daughter's health and living arrangements. That's a red flag for emotional manipulation or boundary issues. The parent is concerned about their daughter's safety and well-being, which is a natural instinct. However, the parent took the step to directly tell the daughter to break up with the boyfriend instead of trying to address the mother's behavior first or letting the daughter handle it. \n\nIn some cases, parental intervention might be necessary if there's a clear threat to a child's safety. The mother arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge is concerning, especially since minors typically need parental consent for medical decisions. Pressuring the daughter to move in could also be a form of enabling a toxic dynamic or manipulating the relationship. The boyfriend's support of these actions might indicate that he's complicit, which could be problematic as well.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? The parent's main concern is their daughter's well-being. They observed multiple red flags and felt that the relationship was becoming toxic. However, breaking up the relationship is a heavy-handed approach. The parent could have tried to address the boyfriend's mother first, maybe through a conversation to set boundaries, or involved professionals if necessary. Also, considering that the daughter is 16, she's in a formative age where relationships can be a learning experience, but her safety is paramount. \n\nThe parent might not have given their daughter a chance to handle the situation or understand the context. For example, maybe the boyfriend's mother was trying to help and the daughter agreed to move in as a solution. However, the mother's actions seem controlling. The boyfriend's response of berating the daughter for talking to her parent is also concerning. It might indicate that he's not supportive of the daughter having a healthy relationship with her mother, which is another red flag.\n\nSo, the parent had valid concerns and felt the situation was crossing into harmful territory. But is it wrong to act on those concerns without exhausting other options? It's a judgment call. The parent's intention was to protect their daughter, but breaking up the relationship directly could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter and boyfriend are otherwise happy. However, the parent might have felt it was necessary due to the immediate risks involved. \n\nIn the end, I think the parent acted out of concern for their daughter's safety. While the approach might be seen as harsh, the underlying behavior from the boyfriend's mother and son could indeed be toxic. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. If the parent had documented the red flags and tried to address them before breaking up the relationship, maybe it's a better approach. But given the information, the parent's decision seems justified to prevent potential harm.\n"
