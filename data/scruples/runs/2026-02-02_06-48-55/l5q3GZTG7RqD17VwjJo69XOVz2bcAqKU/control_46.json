I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, same high school. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mom is acting like a second parent, telling the daughter to think of her as her mom, calling her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised the daughter, and even arranging a therapy appointment. The boyfriend's mom wants the daughter to move in with them, and the parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Both teens are minors, so the parent has a responsibility to protect their child. The boyfriend's mother is clearly overstepping by trying to replace the parent and making decisions about the daughter's mental health without the parent's consent. That's a red flag. The parent is concerned about safety and manipulation, which is valid. The parent's right to protect their child from what they perceive as harmful influences is a key point here.\n\nBut wait, the parent is intervening in their child's relationship. Some might argue that the daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but since she's 16, she's still a minor. Parents have a legal right to be involved in their children's lives, especially when there are concerns about safety or manipulation. However, the parent didn't approach the situation by trying to talk to the boyfriend's mother first or involve their daughter in the decision. They directly told the daughter to break up, which might be seen as overstepping, but given the circumstances, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother's actions are definitely concerning. She's trying to take control of the daughter's life, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The boyfriend supporting this behavior adds to the parent's concern. Breaking up the relationship might be a protective measure, especially if the parent believes the daughter is being indoctrinated. However, sometimes parents can act out of their own anxiety, so there's a balance here.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might have a right to be concerned. The boyfriend's mother arranging medical appointments and pressuring the daughter could be a form of undue influence. The parent's role is to ensure their child's well-being, so stepping in when there's a threat from a third party could be appropriate. But is the parent in the wrong for not considering the daughter's feelings or allowing her to decide? The daughter might feel her autonomy is being violated, but the parent's actions are to protect her from what they see as a dangerous situation.\n\nI think the parent's actions are justified given the mother's manipulative behavior. The key is the parent's role in protecting their child. Even though they broke up the relationship without the daughter's agreement, the intention is safety. So the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
