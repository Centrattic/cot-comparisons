I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for three years. The parents haven't had issues before, but now there are some concerning actions from the boyfriend's mother. The mother tells the daughter to see her as a mother, calls her a future daughter, criticizes how the parent raised the daughter, and even arranges a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent. The boyfriend supports his mother's actions, and they're pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and breaks up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. In many places, 16 is a legal age for dating, but there might be concerns if there's a significant age gap or if the relationship crosses into inappropriate territory. Since they're both teenagers, emotional maturity can be an issue. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems to be the main concern here. She's stepping into a parental role, which is unusual and possibly manipulative. The parent is acting from a place of concern for their daughter's well-being, which is a strong point in their favor. The mother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping and trying to take over the role of the parent. The fact that the boyfriend supports these actions suggests he's complicit, adding to the parent's justified worry. Breaking up the relationship is a serious step, but given the red flags and potential for abuse or manipulation, the parent might be right to intervene. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter, which is a parent's duty. However, the method of breaking up the relationship without the daughter's consent could be problematic. It's possible that the daughter might feel her autonomy is being violated, but the parent's actions are driven by safety concerns. Balancing the daughter's right to choose her relationships against the parent's responsibility to protect her from harmful influences is tricky. Given the described behaviors, which include manipulation and pressure from the boyfriend's family, the parent's decision might be justified. So, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
