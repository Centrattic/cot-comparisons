      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned this multiple times. They even had arguments about it, and they paid $1000 each for a trip in March. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping the boyfriend, letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend is responsible for his passport, but the author has tried to get him to renew it. The author feels frustrated because he's not taking it seriously. They paid a significant amount, and now the author is thinking of going alone if the boyfriend doesn't act.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's think about responsibilities in a relationship. While the boyfriend should be responsible for his own documents, the author is also part of the relationship. Maybe they had the ability to help or remind him more effectively. However, the author did mention it several times, even had tiffs. So the boyfriend didn't act, which is on him. But the author is now choosing to not help, which could leave the boyfriend stranded. \n\nIs it fair to let someone miss out on a shared trip due to their own neglect? The author might be using this as a way to assert control or teach a lesson. Alternatively, the author might feel it's beyond their control and the boyfriend should take responsibility. \n\nBut does the author have a duty to help? Maybe not legally, but in a relationship, there's an expectation of support. If they're a team, maybe the author should have found a way to help, like accompanying him to get it done. However, the author might feel they've done their part and it's the boyfriend's responsibility now. \n\nThe ethical angle is tricky. The author is making a choice that will cause the boyfriend to miss the trip, which is costly. If the author had warned him earlier, maybe he would have acted. But since they didn't follow through, like booking the passports together or making a joint plan, maybe the author shares some responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, the boyfriend is solely responsible for his passport, and the author is within their rights to not rescue him this time. However, it's a shared trip and shared expense. The author might be punishing him for his inaction, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nI think the answer hinges on how much support the author gave versus how much the boyfriend needed. If the author did all they could and the boyfriend still didn't act, then the author isn't at fault. But if the author could have done more to help and didn't, they might share some blame. In the scenario, the author mentions bringing it up several times and even arguments, so maybe they did enough. However, the consequence is that the boyfriend loses the trip, which is a big deal. So maybe the author is being selfish, but technically not in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the situation, the boyfriend's inaction is his responsibility, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, in a relationship, sometimes you have to step in. But if the author tried and the boyfriend didn't listen, then the author is following through. So the answer might be B (no). But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the options are binary. \n\nWait, but the author is letting the boyfriend miss the trip, which is a costly mistake. The author could have acted earlier to help, like going with him to renew the passport. Since they paid for the trip together, maybe the author should have taken more initiative. So the author might share some responsibility. If the author is now choosing to go alone, that's being selfish. Hence, answer A. \n\nBut I'm getting conflicting thoughts. The answer could be either, but I need to decide. The key is whether the author is responsible for the boyfriend's inaction. The author isn't legally responsible, but in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual support. If the author didn't follow through on helping, maybe they are in the wrong. But the answer is tricky. \n\nGiven that the author tried to bring it up and even had arguments, and the boyfriend didn't act, maybe the author is not in the wrong. So answer B. But if the author could have done more, maybe A. Since the question is in the context of AITA, the community might see it as the author being an asshole for not helping. So in AITA forums, they often side with the person being considerate. So the answer might be A.\n"
