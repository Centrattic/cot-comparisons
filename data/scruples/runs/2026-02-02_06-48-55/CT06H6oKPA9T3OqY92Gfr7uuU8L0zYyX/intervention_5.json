      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. They've been dating over a year and mention that their boyfriend can be juvenile, leading to a mother-child dynamic. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked and paid for a $1000 each trip in November. Now, the deadline for sending the passport for renewal is approaching, and the author is considering not saying anything so the boyfriend can deal with the consequences. The author wants to go on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get it done in time.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, let's look at the responsibilities. The author mentions that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. They've tried to get him to renew it multiple times, including arguments. So the main issue is the boyfriend not taking responsibility for his own passport. However, the author is now considering not helping or reminding him anymore, leading to him potentially missing the trip. \n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibility. The author paid for the trip, which is a significant expense. Even though the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, the author might have a stake in ensuring they can go together. By not saying anything, the author is letting the boyfriend face the consequences of his inaction. But does that make the author an asshole?\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend has been neglecting his responsibility for a long time, and the author has tried to push him. On the other, the author is choosing to abandon the trip for the boyfriend, which could be seen as a form of punishment. The author is not helping but also not holding the boyfriend accountable, which might be justified if the boyfriend is being negligent. However, the trip was a shared experience they both booked. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses a significant amount of money and the experience, but maybe it's a lesson for him to take responsibility.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they had helped him get the passport renewed, maybe they would both go. But the author is choosing not to intervene, leading to the trip being ruined for the boyfriend. Is that fair? The author might be using this as a way to make him learn, but it's a harsh punishment. Alternatively, the author could have given him a final reminder or set a deadline, but instead, they're just stepping back.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend should be the one to renew his passport. The author has done their part by bringing it up and arguing about it. However, by not taking any further action, the author is letting the situation play out. It's possible that the author is being passive-aggressive instead of taking a direct approach. Maybe they should have given a final warning before deciding not to help. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't do anything to prevent the situation from getting to this point, maybe they are partially at fault. But if the boyfriend has been ignoring the issue for so long despite multiple reminders, the responsibility shifts more to him. The author is being passive, but perhaps not entirely in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could depend on whether the author had a duty to ensure they both go on the trip, which they paid for. But since the passport is the boyfriend's responsibility, the author might not be at fault. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they could have taken more proactive steps to ensure the passport is renewed, even if the ultimate responsibility is the boyfriend's. By not doing anything, they're allowing a preventable problem to occur, which could be seen as neglecting their role in the relationship.\n"
