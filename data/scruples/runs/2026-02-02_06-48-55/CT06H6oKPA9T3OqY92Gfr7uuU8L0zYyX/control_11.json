I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The author's boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it multiple times, even having arguments. They paid $1000 each for the trip, and now she's considering not saying anything so he deals with the consequences if he misses the deadline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's responsibility: was she supposed to remind him again? She did bring it up several times and even had tiffs. But maybe she should have pushed harder or set a stricter deadline. On the other hand, the boyfriend has been neglecting his passport for a long time, which is his responsibility. The author might feel she's doing enough by reminding him, but maybe not enough if she's not following up closer to the trip.\n\nThe cost is a factor. They both paid a lot, so if he can't go due to his own negligence, she might feel it's his issue. But does that justify her not helping him? If they're a couple, maybe there's an expectation of teamwork. However, if he's been juvenile and she's been in a mother-child dynamic, maybe she's justified in stepping back.\n\nAlso, preemptively deciding to leave him without a word could be harsh. It's a big trip, and he might not be prepared. But she's frustrated with his behavior. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nLegally, she's not at fault because the passport is his. Emotionally, the dynamics matter. If she's been patient and he's not listened, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she had the chance to help more, maybe she is. The answer hinges on whether the author took reasonable steps to ensure he acted. She did mention it multiple times, so maybe she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
