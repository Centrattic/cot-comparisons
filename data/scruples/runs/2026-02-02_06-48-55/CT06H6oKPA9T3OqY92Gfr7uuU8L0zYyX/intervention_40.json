I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a boyfriend whose passport has been expired since 2018, and the writer is going on a trip in March. They've had arguments about it, and now the deadline is approaching. The writer is considering not saying anything and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences, meaning he might miss the trip.\n\nFirst, I should think about the responsibilities here. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. But since they're in a relationship, maybe the writer feels some responsibility to help or remind. The user mentioned bringing it up several times and even had tiffs. So they've tried to communicate. The key point is whether the writer is being negligent by not doing more now.\n\nBut the writer is also paying for the trip, right? They both paid $1000 each. If the boyfriend doesn't get his passport in time, they both lose the money. However, the writer is considering going alone. That might be selfish, but maybe they feel justified because they've warned him multiple times. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. If the author is in a position where they could have helped or reminded more, but chose not to, maybe they are at fault. However, the boyfriend is the one who didn't act despite being reminded. The writer might be within their rights to let him take responsibility now. On the other hand, being in a relationship might imply some level of support. \n\nAlso, the writer's motivation is important. Are they punishing him for being juvenile, or are they taking responsibility for their own actions? If they've given up on helping and are now cutting him off, maybe that's harsh. But if they've done everything possible and he's not listening, maybe it's his responsibility. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they are in a relationship, should they have stepped in more? Or is it the boyfriend's fault for not acting on his own responsibilities? The user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is that the author isn't wrong because the boyfriend was negligent, but the author has a right to prioritize their own plans if they've made their concerns clear. Alternatively, maybe the author should have helped more, making them at fault. \n\nI think the key is that the writer tried multiple times and even had arguments. The boyfriend didn't act. So the author isn't necessarily at fault for not doing more. Therefore, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because sometimes in relationships, you support each other. However, if the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, the writer isn't obligated to help beyond a certain point. So answer B.\n"
