I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The author mentions that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and they've had multiple reminders and even fought about it. They paid a lot for the trip, and the deadline is approaching. The author is planning not to say anything and let the boyfriend handle it, even if he can't go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The author knew the passport was expired for a long time. They had chances to address it earlier. Maybe the boyfriend wasn't taking it seriously, so the author's frustration is understandable. But by not reminding him now, are they being irresponsible? The trip is booked, and the boyfriend's responsibility is to get his passport sorted. However, the author might feel that since they've already tried multiple times and the boyfriend didn't act, they can't be held responsible anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's plan to not say anything could be seen as abandoning the boyfriend. If the author doesn't mention it, the boyfriend might not realize the urgency, leading to missing the trip. That could leave the boyfriend in a difficult situation, especially since they've already spent a lot of money. The author is choosing to go alone, which might be a consequence of the boyfriend's inaction, but they could be seen as not supporting their partner when he needs it.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship dynamics. The author mentions a mother-child dynamic, suggesting the boyfriend is juvenile. The author might feel they have to take care of everything, leading to resentment. However, cutting off communication here might not solve the underlying issues. The author might be trying to set a boundary, which is healthy, but the method could be harsh.\n\nLegally and practically, the author isn't responsible for the boyfriend's passport. But emotionally, they might feel responsible because they've invested in the trip and have tried to get him to act. The question is whether the author's inaction is neglectful or justified. If they didn't act, maybe they're avoiding conflict, but the boyfriend's responsibility remains.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing. However, the author could have made sure he understood the stakes. By not reminding him again, they're not helping him. But maybe they're done enabling his behavior. It's a tough call. The answer might hinge on whether the author's approach is seen as neglecting their duty to support their partner versus protecting themselves from someone's irresponsibility.\n"
