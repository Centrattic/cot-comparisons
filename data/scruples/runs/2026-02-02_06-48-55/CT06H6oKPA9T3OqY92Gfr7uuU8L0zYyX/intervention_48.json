I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport go unaddressed, leading to him missing their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times, even leading to arguments. They booked the trip in November, which cost $1000 each. The author is now considering not reminding him again and letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time. She's planning to go on the trip alone if he doesn't act.\n\nThe key points here are: the boyfriend's responsibility to manage his own passport, the author's repeated attempts to address the issue, and the financial investment involved. While the author has tried to bring it up, the final responsibility for travel documents usually lies with the individual. However, since they're a couple planning a joint trip, there's an expectation of mutual responsibility. But the author is now choosing to let him take full responsibility, even if it means he might miss the trip.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she's made multiple attempts to address the issue and he hasn't acted, then she's done her part. By not reminding him again, she's letting him face the consequences of his own inaction. However, some might argue that as a partner, she should support him in getting it done, especially since the trip is a shared expense. But others might say that after multiple reminders and arguments, she's justified in stepping back and not being the enabler.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer depends on where you draw the line between partnership responsibilities. In relationships, there's an expectation of teamwork, but individual accountability for personal tasks is also important. If the boyfriend didn't act despite her efforts, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not continuing to push. However, the fact that they both paid for the trip might mean she should have ensured he had proper documentation, but if she's already made her attempts, she's not solely at fault.\n"
