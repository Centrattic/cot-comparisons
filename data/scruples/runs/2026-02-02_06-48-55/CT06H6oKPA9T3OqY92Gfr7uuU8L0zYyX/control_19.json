I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport ruin their trip. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has tried to get him to renew it multiple times, even leading to arguments. The trip was booked and paid for in November with the knowledge that the passport needed to be renewed. The deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not saying anything and letting him handle the consequences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. The author did bring up the passport issue several times, but maybe not enough? Or maybe she didn't take more concrete steps to help him? She did argue with him, but if he's been resistant or neglectful, is it fair to blame her? The trip was paid for by both, so financially they're both invested. However, the author is now planning to go alone if he doesn't act in time. \n\nThe boyfriend's responsibility to get his passport is his own. If he failed to act despite being warned, then maybe the author isn't at fault. But maybe she should have done more to support him in renewing it, especially since they're planning a trip. However, the user says he can be juvenile, and she feels like the parent. In that case, maybe she's not in the wrong for not taking more responsibility for his mistake. \n\nAlso, the cost is a factor. If she goes alone, he loses the money and the trip, but she might feel it's his fault. The question is about whether she's the asshole. The community often looks at intent and responsibility. If she made her concerns known and he didn't act, she might not be in the wrong. But if she knew and did nothing, even if he's at fault, maybe it's a shared responsibility. \n\nI think the key points are that she tried to address it multiple times, he didn't act, and she's not forcing him to go. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
