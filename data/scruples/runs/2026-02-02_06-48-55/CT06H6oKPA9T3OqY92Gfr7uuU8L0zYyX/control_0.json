I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The key points here are the timeline and the responsibility.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Then, they booked the trip in November, which is a significant expense. Now, the deadline is approaching for him to get the passport renewed.\n\nThe author is considering not helping him anymore and letting him face the consequences if he doesn't act. She wants to go on the trip alone. The question is whether this makes her an asshole.\n\nI need to consider both parties. The boyfriend has been neglecting his passport, which is his responsibility. The author has tried to prompt him, but he's not taking action. She's now deciding to take no further steps, which could lead to him missing the trip. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. Even though he's responsible for his own passport, the author is part of the relationship. She might have a duty to help or at least communicate more to find a solution. However, she's also frustrated and feels like she's in a parent-child dynamic. \n\nOn one hand, not helping him might be seen as abandoning him, but on the other, he's aware of the deadline and the consequences. If she's been clear and he still doesn't act, maybe she isn't at fault. \n\nBut maybe she should have intervened more, like helping him renew it or covering the costs. However, the user states that she's not going to say anything and let him handle it. If he didn't take her warnings seriously, then she's not entirely to blame. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the passport is his. She can't force him to renew it. Her choice to go without him is her decision, but it's a harsh one. The community might judge her for not ensuring he can come, but legally and ethically, she isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's about personal responsibility and the limits of a relationship's expectations.\n"
