I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend has an expired passport, and they've already booked and paid a lot for a trip. The author has mentioned the passport issue several times, even had arguments about it. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get his act together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should contribute to planning a trip, especially when it's something they both wanted. But the boyfriend hasn't taken action despite being reminded. The author has tried to communicate and even had conflicts, which shows they did their part. However, the author is now thinking of abandoning the trip for the boyfriend if he doesn't fix it. That seems harsh because they both paid for the trip. But maybe the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing his passport. On the other hand, the author could have stepped in to help him renew it, but instead, they decided to let him face the consequences. Is that being overly harsh? It depends on whether the author did everything possible to ensure both could go. If the author didn't offer help or support in renewing the passport, just kept reminding him, maybe they share some responsibility. But if they did ask and he ignored it, then the author isn't entirely wrong. The key point is whether the author acted responsibly. Letting someone face the consequences of their own inaction isn't necessarily wrong, especially if they've been warned. But in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual support. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not helping more, or not? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the boyfriend is the one in the wrong for not acting. The author's plan is to let him deal with it, which could be seen as holding him accountable. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
