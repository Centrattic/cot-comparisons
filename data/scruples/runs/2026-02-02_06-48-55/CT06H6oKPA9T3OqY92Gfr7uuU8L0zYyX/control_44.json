I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and she's brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. The trip is booked, costing $1000 each. The deadline is approaching, and the author plans to let him deal with the consequences and go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has tried to get her boyfriend to renew his passport, but he hasn't taken action. She's made multiple attempts, even had conflicts over it. The trip is expensive and they've already paid. If the passport isn't renewed on time, he can't go. She's choosing to go without him. \n\nOn one hand, she's tried to communicate and push him to fix the issue. She's not the one responsible for the expired passport; that's his responsibility. However, she might have a duty to inform him more clearly or ensure he's aware of the deadline, even if she's frustrated. But she's already given him chances and he didn't act. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not helping him after multiple failures. If she's made her position clear and he still didn't act, then she's not necessarily at fault. But if she had the opportunity to step in and help, maybe she should have. However, the user says she's planning to let him deal with it, which some might see as selfish if she values the trip over his potential issues. \n\nBut considering the financial investment and the fact that he's responsible for his own passport, she's within her rights to follow through. The key point is that the passport is his responsibility, and she's given him multiple chances. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
