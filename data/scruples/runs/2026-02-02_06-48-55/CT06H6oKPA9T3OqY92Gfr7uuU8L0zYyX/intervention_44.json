I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up several times. They even booked a trip in November, costing $1000 each. Now, the deadline for renewing is approaching, and the author is planning not to say anything and let the boyfriend handle it, possibly missing the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should communicate effectively. The author did mention the passport issue multiple times, even had arguments. But maybe they should have set a specific time or reminded him closer to the deadline. However, the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. The author can't renew it for him. But in a relationship, some level of support is expected. \n\nThe cost of the trip is a factor too. The author might be thinking about not wasting the money they both paid, but if the boyfriend didn't act on his end, maybe the author isn't at fault. The question is whether it's the author's responsibility to push harder or if it's the boyfriend's own responsibility. \n\nAlso, the author's intention to go on the trip alone while the boyfriend deals with his mistake could be seen as cutting him off, but if he's aware of the consequences, maybe it's a valid consequence. However, maybe the author should have given a clearer deadline or helped him get it done. But the boyfriend's juvenile behavior and the author's feeling of being in a mother-child dynamic might mean the author tried their best. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points are communication, responsibility, and fairness. The author did communicate, but maybe not effectively enough. The boyfriend didn't take responsibility. The author's decision to let him face the consequences could be justified, but maybe they should have intervened more. However, given the repeated reminders and the boyfriend's inaction, the author isn't entirely at fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
