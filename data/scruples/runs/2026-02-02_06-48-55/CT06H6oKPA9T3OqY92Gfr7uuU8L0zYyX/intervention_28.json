I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire, leading to him missing the trip. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They had arguments, even tiffs, and the trip was booked in November. The author is considering not helping anymore and just going on the trip alone, letting him face the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author tried to bring up the passport issue several times. The boyfriend didn't act on it. The trip was booked and paid for, costing $1000 each. The author is now planning to go alone, not helping further. The question is whether this makes the author an asshole.\n\nNow, considering relationships and responsibilities. In a relationship, especially when planning something together, both parties share some responsibility. However, the boyfriend has been neglecting a critical task (renewing his passport) despite being reminded. The author has done their part by reminding and discussing it, but the boyfriend didn't follow through. The author is now choosing to take responsibility for their own part and let the boyfriend deal with the consequences of his inaction.\n\nBut is it fair for the author to leave him hanging? If the author had continued to help and maybe even tried to push harder, maybe the situation could be resolved. However, given that the boyfriend has been juvenile and the author feels like a parent in the dynamic, the author might be protecting themselves from further stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the trip was a joint decision. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses the trip and the money. The author might be seen as letting the boyfriend off the hook for his inaction. But the author has tried to communicate beforehand. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing his passport. The author has done their part by reminding. So the author isn't in the wrong for not helping further. However, letting the boyfriend miss the trip might be harsh, but the author is not the one who caused the passport to expire. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (no), the author is not in the wrong. They've tried to address the issue, and the consequence of the boyfriend's inaction is on him.\n"
