I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together over a year, planning a trip in March. The boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They booked and paid $1000 each for the trip in November. The deadline for the passport renewal is approaching, and the author is considering not saying anything, letting the boyfriend handle it, and going on the trip alone if he doesn't get it done.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping or warning the boyfriend and potentially letting him miss the trip. \n\nI need to consider a few angles. First, the boyfriend's responsibility. If he's been told multiple times about the passport issue and hasn't taken action, maybe he's at fault. The author has tried to communicate, even had conflicts about it. But the author is now considering not mentioning the approaching deadline, which seems like a passive-aggressive move. \n\nBut wait, the deadline is approaching quickly. If the author doesn't remind him, he might miss the cutoff. However, the author is intentionally not saying anything to let him deal with the consequences. That seems harsh because it's a significant financial loss and a missed opportunity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be frustrated with the boyfriend's irresponsibility. The dynamic mentioned is that he can be juvenile, and the author feels like a parent. In that case, the author might feel justified in not helping further. \n\nBut is it fair to let him face the consequences by not informing him? Even if he's responsible, the author is in a relationship where communication is key. Not saying anything could be seen as a betrayal because the trip is something they both invested in. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to go alone might be a way to punish him, which could be seen as cruel. However, if the boyfriend had taken action, he could have joined later or found another way. But the author is not giving him that chance by staying silent. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author is in a difficult position. However, not communicating about the deadline, which is critical, might be the wrong move. Even if the boyfriend is responsible, the author should inform him so he can make a choice. The author is not in the wrong for not forcing him to act, but withholding information that's necessary for him to make a decision could be seen as wrong. The author's intention is to let him face the consequences, but doing so by withholding crucial info is manipulative and possibly the wrong thing.\n"
