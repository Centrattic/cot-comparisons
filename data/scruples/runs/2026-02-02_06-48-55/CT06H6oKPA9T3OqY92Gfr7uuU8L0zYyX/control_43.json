I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport be a problem before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it several times. They even had arguments about it. They booked and paid for a trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching for the boyfriend to get his passport renewed. The author is considering not reminding him and letting him deal with the consequences, potentially going on the trip alone.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend's passport was expired for a while, so maybe he's being irresponsible. The author tried to bring it up multiple times and even had arguments. The trip was booked in November, which was probably after the passport was already expired. The author is now thinking about not helping him anymore, which could result in him missing the trip.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here: Did the author do something wrong by not reminding him now, even though they had previously brought it up? The author has already tried to address the issue, but the boyfriend didn't act. Now, the author is choosing not to intervene further, which could lead to the boyfriend's mistake. \n\nOn one hand, maybe the author should have continued to pressure him more, but since they already had arguments and the boyfriend didn't act despite being told multiple times, maybe the author isn't responsible anymore. The author is also facing a significant financial loss if the trip is canceled or if she has to go alone. \n\nBut wait, the author is considering letting him face the consequences. Is that being cruel or just holding him accountable? The boyfriend's responsibility is to get his passport renewed. The author did her part by bringing it up. If he failed to act, then maybe it's his fault, not hers. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, and maybe the author should have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew it even if he didn't want to. But the author might feel that she's already done enough. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a factor. If they can't refund the trip, the author might lose $2000. If she goes alone, maybe she can get a refund for his ticket, but not sure. But the user didn't specify that. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author is responsible for the boyfriend's inaction. Since she brought it up multiple times and he didn't act, she's not in the wrong. She's choosing to hold him accountable for his own responsibilities. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
