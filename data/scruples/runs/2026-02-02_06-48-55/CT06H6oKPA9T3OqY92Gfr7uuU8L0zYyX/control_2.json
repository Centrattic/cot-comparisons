I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and just going alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners usually share the planning and logistics of a trip. If one has a critical document like a passport expired, the other might expect help. But the author says they've tried to bring it up several times, even had tiffs. So maybe the boyfriend didn't take it seriously. The author's intention is to let him face the consequences. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate the issue. On the other, maybe they should have insisted more or helped him renew it. But if the boyfriend kept ignoring the problem despite warnings, the author might be justified in not helping further. The cost is a factor too; they both paid, so the author isn't financially responsible for his mistake. \n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned is that the boyfriend is juvenile, and the author feels like a mother. This might imply that the boyfriend hasn't taken responsibility for his own obligations. The author's decision to go alone could be seen as a consequence for his irresponsibility. But is it being an asshole? If they had a plan and the boyfriend didn't act, the author isn't to blame. However, maybe they could have nagged more or set up a system to track the deadline. But given the context, the author did their part. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
