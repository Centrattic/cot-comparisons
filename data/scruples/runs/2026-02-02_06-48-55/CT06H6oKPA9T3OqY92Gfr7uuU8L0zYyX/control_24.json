I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's mentioned this several times. They booked the trip in November, which costs $1000 each. The deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him anymore, letting him deal with the consequences. She's asking if she's an asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the boyfriend has been ignoring the passport issue for a long time, the author has tried to bring it up, even had arguments about it. She's frustrated, feels like she's the parent in the relationship. Now, with the trip booked and the deadline near, she's choosing not to intervene anymore, even if he messes up.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The question is about responsibility. The boyfriend is an adult; he's responsible for his own passport. However, in a relationship, partners often support each other. The author has tried to get him to renew it but he didn't act. Now she's withdrawing support. \n\nIs it her responsibility to keep pushing him? Maybe she's taken on too much, trying to handle his affairs. But on the other hand, she's investing in the trip (her own $1000), and she might be prioritizing her own well-being. If he's being irresponsible, maybe she's within her rights to stop enabling that behavior. \n\nBut then, maybe she should have set boundaries earlier. By not helping him now, she's letting him face the consequences, which could be seen as fair. The problem is whether she's being selfish by going on the trip alone. However, she's not forcing him to go; he's the one who didn't take action. The money is her own, so she can choose to use it. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other through issues like this. If she had a plan to make sure he got his passport, that would be better, but since he didn't act, maybe her hands are tied. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). She's taking responsibility for her own actions and not enabling his irresponsibility. The boyfriend is an adult and should have handled his passport. She's not forcing him to go; she's just going without him if he doesn't act. It's a hard choice, but not necessarily wrong.\n"
