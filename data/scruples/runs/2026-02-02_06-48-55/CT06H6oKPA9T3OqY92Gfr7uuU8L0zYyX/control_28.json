I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before the trip. The key points here are the timeline and the actions each person took.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport expired in May 2018, which is way before the trip was booked in November. The author mentions they've brought it up several times and even had arguments about it. So, there was prior knowledge of the issue. The trip is in March, and the deadline for the passport renewal is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences, meaning he might miss the trip.\n\nNow, the question is about responsibility. The author argues that the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, which is true because a passport is a personal document. However, the author also mentions that they've tried to get him to renew it multiple times. The boyfriend's negligence or inaction over an extended period (since May 2018) is a key factor here. \n\nThe author is being proactive by not wanting to delay the trip or take responsibility for his actions. The boyfriend's lack of action despite repeated reminders could suggest he wasn't taking the situation seriously. The author's decision to proceed with the trip alone isn't malicious but a consequence of his own failure to act. \n\nBut wait, is the author being too passive? They could have set stricter boundaries earlier, like refusing to book the trip until the passport was sorted. However, they did book the trip in November, which was after the passport was already expired. The author's current stance is to let him face the consequences, which is a valid approach if they've done their part in reminding him. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a partner, the author has a duty to ensure the trip can happen for both. But the passport is his responsibility. The author isn't actively sabotaging; they're just not intervening further. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend's inaction over a long period, despite multiple reminders, makes him primarily responsible. The author tried to address the issue and now is choosing to hold him accountable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
