It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before the trip. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend are planning a trip to another country in March. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned this multiple times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip. Now, the deadline is near for the passport to be sent in for renewal, and the author is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get it together.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The author has clearly communicated the issue several times, even had conflicts. So they've made their concerns known. The boyfriend hasn't acted on those warnings, which is on him. But the author is now deciding not to remind him anymore, even though it's his responsibility to get his passport renewed. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to keep nagging him? Maybe not. If they've already tried multiple times and the boyfriend ignored it, the author might feel justified in not taking further action. However, by not reminding him, the author is allowing the situation to escalate. But the main issue here is that the boyfriend is an adult and should be responsible for his own documents. The author could have helped him get it done, but they chose not to now. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a position where they are planning a trip they've paid for. If the boyfriend doesn't get his passport, he can't join, and the author would be left with the financial loss and maybe guilt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not taking further action when they've already tried. \n\nI think the key points are: the boyfriend's responsibility to renew his passport, the author's attempts to address it, and the boyfriend's inaction. The author isn't forcing the boyfriend to go; they're just not helping anymore. Since the passport is his responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
