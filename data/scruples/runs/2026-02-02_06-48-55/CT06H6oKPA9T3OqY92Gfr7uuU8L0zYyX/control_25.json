It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe couple has been together over a year. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for a trip in March. The deadline is approaching for him to get his passport renewed. The author is considering not helping him and just going on the trip alone, knowing he might miss out. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider responsibility in a relationship. Both partners have responsibilities. The author brought up the passport issue multiple times, which shows she tried to address it. The boyfriend didn't act on it despite knowing the consequences. The author is now planning to let him deal with the consequences, even if it means he can't go. \n\nIs it fair for her to take that stance? Well, in a relationship, people often help each other out. But if one partner is repeatedly ignoring their responsibilities despite being reminded, maybe the other is not at fault. The author is not forcing him to go, but she's choosing to go without him. She's not directly causing the problem, but she's not helping either. \n\nHowever, she might be seen as abandoning him because she's aware of the deadline but isn't giving him a final push. But she might feel she's done her part. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, and if he didn't act, the consequence is on him. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other. If she had pushed harder, maybe he would have complied. But she's already asked multiple times and had conflicts. It's possible she's done all she can. \n\nThe cost is also a factor. They paid a lot, but if he doesn't act, she's not going to refund him. She's choosing to go on her own. Is that being selfish? Maybe, but she might not want to waste the money or miss the trip due to his neglect. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is not maliciously causing the problem but is allowing the natural consequence to happen. If she had actively prevented him from renewing it, that would be different. Since she's not helping, but the issue was his own responsibility, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, in a relationship, some might expect her to take more responsibility, especially since it affects both of them. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But given that she's made multiple attempts to get him to act and he didn't, the responsibility is on him. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
