I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire and then not helping him, so he might miss the trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's been with him over a year, and he's been neglecting to renew his passport since May 2018. She's brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They booked and paid a significant amount for a trip in March. The deadline is approaching, and she's decided not to help and let him deal with the consequences. She wants to go on the trip alone if he doesn't fix it.\n\nSo, the key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, but the girlfriend has been reminding him. However, she hasn't taken any action beyond discussing it. Now, she's choosing to go ahead without him if he fails to act. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, partners often help each other with important matters. But this is his responsibility. She's given him chances and warned him. If she doesn't step in, it's his fault for not taking action. On the other hand, maybe she should have helped more, like accompanying him to renew it or setting up reminders. But she did bring it up several times. \n\nThe cost of the trip is significant, and they both paid for it. If he misses the trip, is she right to go alone? Some might say she's holding him accountable, others might think she should support him even if he's at fault. But considering he's been neglecting it for a long time, she's tried to communicate, and she's not the one causing the passport issue. The responsibility lies with him. So, she's not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
