I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has mentioned it several times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for a trip in March. The deadline is approaching for the passport to be sent in, and the author is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone if he doesn't get his act together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Both partners in a relationship usually share responsibilities, especially when planning something important like an international trip. The author did mention the passport issue multiple times, which shows they were concerned. The boyfriend is described as juvenile, which might explain why he's not taking this seriously. However, the author is now deciding to let him face the consequences, which could mean he misses the trip. \n\nThe key points here are: Who is responsible for the passport? The passport is his, so technically the responsibility is on him to renew it. The author has tried to bring it up, so maybe they did their part. But when the trip was booked, both were supposed to be involved. If the author is going alone, they might be prioritizing their own plans over helping him. But if the boyfriend is at fault for not acting on the information given, then the author isn't entirely to blame. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more proactive in helping him renew the passport, like assisting with the process or even doing it for him. But since it's his passport, the final responsibility lies with him. The author might feel frustrated and decide to take a stand. However, leaving him in the lurch after the trip was booked together could be seen as selfish, especially since both paid for it. \n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. They both paid for the trip, so if he can't go, he might not get his money back. The author might end up losing their money too. But maybe that's a consequence of not taking responsibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they've done their part to warn and remind him, then maybe not. But if they could have helped more or ensured the passport was renewed before booking, then maybe they share some blame. However, since the decision is to let him handle it now, and the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the author should have intervened more, but given the information, they might be justified.\n"
