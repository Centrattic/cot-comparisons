It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a trip. They've known about the expired passport since May 2018 and brought it up multiple times. They had a tiff over it, and even booked the trip in November. The deadline is approaching, and they plan to do nothing, letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has tried to get their partner to renew the passport, even had arguments. They've invested $1000 each in the trip. The boyfriend's responsibility is to keep his passport updated, but the author might have a duty to remind or help. However, if the author has done their part (reminding multiple times), maybe the responsibility shifts. But is it fair to just let him face the consequences?\n\nAlso, the author is frustrated with the boyfriend's juvenile behavior, feeling like a parent. This dynamic might influence their decision. However, by not acting now, they're letting him miss the trip. The author might feel justified if they've done everything possible. But others might see it as abandonment, especially since the trip was booked together. The financial loss is mutual, but is it fair to let someone face that alone?\n\nLegally, the boyfriend is responsible for his passport. But in a relationship, shared responsibilities can exist. If the author has been proactive in reminding him and he ignored it, maybe the author isn't at fault. On the other hand, maybe the author should have taken more steps to ensure the passport was renewed, like helping him apply. But the author says they brought it up several times, so maybe they assumed he would handle it.\n\nThe key points are: repeated reminders, tiff over the issue, financial commitment. The author's plan to go alone could be seen as a consequence of his inaction. However, letting someone miss a planned trip due to their own negligence might be harsh, but if the author has tried enough, perhaps it's justified. The community might split, but in AITA scenarios, often the person who didn't take responsibility is at fault. Here, the boyfriend didn't act, but the author could be seen as abandoning him. Alternatively, if the author did their part, they're not wrong. I think the answer hinges on who's at fault for the passport issue. Since the boyfriend is responsible for his own documents, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
