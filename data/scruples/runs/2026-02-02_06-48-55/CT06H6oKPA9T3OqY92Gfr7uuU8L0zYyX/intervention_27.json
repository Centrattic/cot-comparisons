I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before a trip. They've had a year-long relationship and he's been neglecting to renew his passport despite multiple reminders and even arguments. The trip is paid for, $1000 each, and the deadline is approaching.\n\nFirst, responsibility. The boyfriend has been in charge of his passport since May 2018. The author has tried to bring it up, even had tiffs. So it's not like she didn't warn him. The onus is on him to get it done. But maybe she should have pushed harder? Or maybe she should have taken some action instead of just not saying anything?\n\nThen the consequence: she's planning to go alone if he doesn't get his act together. Is that fair? She's not making him miss it; he's making himself miss it by not acting. So maybe she's not at fault. But does the fact that she's not helping or reminding him now count as being an asshole? Like, is she being passive-aggressive or is she just holding him accountable?\n\nAlso, the money aspect. They both paid for the trip. If he can't go, she loses her money. But she's choosing to go alone, which is her right. However, maybe she should have canceled the trip if it's a joint decision. But the question is about her being an asshole for not helping him now.\n\nAnother angle: communication. She says she's not going to say anything. Maybe if she had communicated more clearly, he might have realized the severity. But she's already given him multiple chances. She might be frustrated and trying to teach him a lesson. However, letting someone face consequences they caused themselves isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). She's not the one who neglected the passport. She did her part by reminding. Not intervening further isn't her fault. The boyfriend is responsible for his own documents.\n"
