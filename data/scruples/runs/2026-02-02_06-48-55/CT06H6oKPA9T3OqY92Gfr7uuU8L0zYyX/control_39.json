I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed.

It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend are planning a trip in March. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned this several times, even had arguments about it. They booked and paid for the trip in November. Now the deadline is approaching for him to get the passport renewed to make the trip. The author is considering not helping him and just going alone, knowing he might miss the trip. The question is whether the author is the asshole for doing that.\n\nHmm. So first, the boyfriend's responsibility. His passport has been expired for a long time. The author has tried to bring it up multiple times, even had fights. So the boyfriend hasn't acted on it despite being told. The author is frustrated, and maybe feels like they're taking care of him like a parent. Now, the author is thinking of not helping him at all, even if it means he can't go. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend is an adult. He's been ignoring the problem for years. The author is trying to get him to take responsibility. By not helping him now, the author is letting the boyfriend face the consequences of his own inaction. But the trip was booked together and paid for. If the boyfriend can't go, he might lose the money. The author is considering going alone. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not helping? The author has already tried to bring it up. Maybe the boyfriend should have taken the initiative. The author is frustrated and might be holding their own peace by not being responsible for his mistakes. On the other hand, maybe the author should have stepped in more to help, like helping him renew it even if he didn't want to. But the author might feel that's not their responsibility. \n\nSo if the boyfriend didn't renew his passport despite being reminded, then the author isn't at fault for not helping anymore. The boyfriend is responsible for his own documents. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. But maybe some people would say the author should have helped more. But given the information, the author tried multiple times and the boyfriend didn't act. So the author is not wrong to let him deal with the consequences.\n"
