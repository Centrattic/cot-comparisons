I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since 2018, and they've brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, and the deadline is approaching. The author is considering not helping and letting him deal with it, so she can go alone.\n\nHmm. So, the author is thinking about bailing on the boyfriend if he doesn't renew his passport. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, relationships often involve compromise and responsibility. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for his own passport, which is his personal responsibility. The author has tried to bring it up, even had conflicts. But maybe she should have been more proactive in ensuring he got it done, especially since the trip was booked. However, the passport is his own document. She can't renew it for him. So maybe she's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut then again, they're a couple planning a trip together. If one person is neglecting their part, the other might feel responsible. However, the author is choosing to let him face the consequences. Is that fair? It might be seen as holding him accountable for his own actions. On the other hand, maybe the author should have intervened earlier, like setting a specific time to handle it together. \n\nBut since the boyfriend has been neglecting it for so long, and the author has tried to bring it up multiple times, perhaps the responsibility is more on him. The author is now at the point where they've paid a lot of money, and if he doesn't act, she's left with a loss. Letting him miss out could be a way to enforce responsibility. \n\nHowever, relationships also require support. Maybe she should have helped him renew it, but that's not her responsibility. The passport is his. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's negligence is the main issue. The author is choosing to take a stand by not helping further. \n\nBut would that make her an asshole? If they're in a committed relationship, maybe she should have done more to help him get it done, even if it's his responsibility. However, after multiple chances and arguments, maybe she's justified in not helping anymore. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author should have taken more proactive steps. If she only brought it up and didn't follow through, maybe she's partially at fault. But if she did everything she could and he didn't act, then she's not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the boyfriend's long-term neglect, multiple reminders, and the author's decision to let consequences happen. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the passport is his responsibility. She tried to communicate, and if he didn't act, she's not obligated to save him from his own mistakes. So answer B.\n"
