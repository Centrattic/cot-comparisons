I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author's boyfriend hasn't renewed his passport since May 2018. The author has brought this up multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked and paid a significant amount for a trip together in March. The deadline to get the passport renewed is approaching, and the author's plan is to not mention it anymore and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it done on time. She's considering going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The boyfriend's passport has been expired for a long time, and the author has tried to address it. But the passport is his responsibility. However, since they booked the trip together, maybe there's a shared responsibility here. If she's aware of the deadline and he hasn't acted, is it fair for her to go alone?\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is being responsible or abandoning her partner. On one hand, she's tried to make him renew his passport. On the other hand, by not reminding him now, she's allowing him to miss the trip. Is this a betrayal or a justified response to his negligence?\n\nAnother angle: financial aspect. They paid $1000 each. If he misses the trip because of his own fault, does she have a right to go without him? But maybe she should have set clear consequences earlier. Since she brought it up multiple times, maybe she's done her part. However, by not reminding him now, she's letting him face the consequences of his inaction. That could be seen as fair, but some might argue she should support him to fix it now, even if he was negligent before.\n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned is a mother-child one, which suggests the author might feel like she has to take care of him. Maybe she's using this as a way to teach him a lesson about responsibility. But is it fair to punish him by going alone? It could be seen as holding his past actions against him, especially since the trip is already paid for.\n\nI think there's a mix of factors here. The boyfriend is responsible for his passport, but the author has a role in their relationship. If she's made it clear multiple times and he ignored it, maybe it's his fault. However, leaving him behind could be seen as cruel, especially after investing money and planning together. On the other hand, if she's given up after repeated failures, maybe she's justified in letting him face the consequences.\n\nThe community might split here. Some would say she's right to take responsibility for herself and leave him to his mistakes. Others might say she should have intervened more to help him get his passport done, even if he was negligent.\n\nSo, considering both sides, I think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B). She tried to address the issue repeatedly, and the responsibility for his passport ultimately lies with him. By not helping him now, she's holding him accountable for his own actions, which could be seen as fair. However, there's a nuance where supporting each other in a relationship is important, so some might argue she should help him fix it even now. But given the scenario, she's made her stance clear and is letting him face the consequences. So, the answer is B.\n"
