I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are: the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, the author has brought it up several times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, which is expensive. The deadline is approaching, and the author plans to do nothing, letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time. She wants to go on the trip alone if he messes it up.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user already thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let's think from different angles. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend was responsible for his own passport. The author has clearly communicated the issue multiple times. If he failed to act despite her reminders, maybe it's his responsibility. She's trying to hold him accountable. But on the other hand, considering the relationship context, they're a couple planning a trip together. Did she have a duty to remind him more, maybe push harder? Or is it reasonable to expect him to take ownership of his documents?\n\nAlso, the cost of the trip is significant. If he can't go, she loses money. But is that her fault? She might feel she's protecting herself from being taken advantage of. The dynamic mentioned where she feels like a mother to a child might imply that he's not been responsible, and she's trying to enforce consequences.\n\nBut maybe there's a point where being a supportive partner means helping each other meet obligations. If she had stepped in more, maybe, but she chose not to. Is that being an asshole, or setting a boundary? \n\nLegally, the passport is his responsibility. However, in a relationship, sometimes partners pitch in for travel documents. But she didn't do that here. She's letting him face the consequences. If he knew about the trip for months and still didn't act, maybe she's justified. However, if she had a duty to ensure he had his passport, then she's at fault.\n\nI think the key here is whether she did her part in reminding him and he didn't act. If she did her part, then it's his responsibility. But if she could have done more, maybe she's at fault. The post says she brought it up several times and they had tiffs. That seems like she did her part. So, if he's responsible and she's holding him accountable, then she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
