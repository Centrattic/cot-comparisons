I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since May 2018. The author has mentioned this multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, each paying around $1000. The passport renewal deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and just going alone.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, especially since it's his document. The author has tried to bring it up several times, so they've done their part in communication. The boyfriend's negligence led to the expiration, and the author is now contemplating letting him face the consequences.\n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities can vary. However, personal documents like passports are typically the individual's responsibility. The author isn't necessarily at fault here because they've made their concerns known. The boyfriend didn't act on his end despite being reminded. The author's plan to go on the trip alone if the passport isn't renewed could be a lesson in accountability. While it's harsh to leave someone in the lurch, the fault lies primarily with the boyfriend for not handling his own responsibility.\n\nBut wait, is the author being fair? The boyfriend might have had reasons for not renewing, like forgetfulness or being overwhelmed. The author might be frustrated with his immaturity, but cutting off support entirely could be seen as punitive. However, if the author has made it clear multiple times and the boyfriend still didn't act, the author isn't obligated to bail him out now. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: each paid $1000. The author isn't responsible for the boyfriend's share, so they could argue that they've already contributed their part. If the boyfriend doesn't have a valid passport, he forfeits his spot. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the author might be seen as standing their ground after repeated failures. But some might argue that the boyfriend is just human and made a mistake, so the author should be more understanding. However, since the author has already tried to communicate and the boyfriend didn't act, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's inaction is the main issue here. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
