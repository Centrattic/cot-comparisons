I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe user and her boyfriend are planning a trip in March. He hasn't renewed his passport since May 2018, and she's brought it up multiple times. They've even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip. Now the deadline is approaching, and she's considering not saying anything and letting him handle it, possibly missing the trip. She wants to know if she's an a**hole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. However, since they're a couple planning a trip together, it's reasonable to expect that both would communicate and handle necessary tasks. The author did bring it up several times and had conflicts, so she's tried to address the issue.\n\nThe key point here is whether she's at fault for not continuing to push him. In a relationship, one partner can't force the other to act, but they can communicate and support each other. If the boyfriend ignored repeated warnings and failed to act, is the author responsible for his inaction? Or is she justified in not taking further action after making her concerns known?\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: they both paid for the trip. If he misses the deadline due to his own neglect, he might lose the money, but the author would still go. Is it fair for her to go without him? If he's aware of the consequences and didn't act, maybe she isn't at fault. But some might argue that she should have intervened more, like helping him renew the passport or maybe even going without him to avoid the waste. However, the user is considering not saying anything, which could be seen as passive-aggressive or not fully supporting him, but if he's aware of the risks, maybe she's not responsible for his choices.\n\nOn the other hand, in a relationship, you might expect mutual support and problem-solving. If she knew the deadline was approaching and he wasn't acting, maybe she should have taken more direct steps, like helping him get the passport, or at least discussing the consequences openly. But since he's an adult and she's already tried to bring it up without success, maybe it's his responsibility. The question is whether her inaction makes her an a**hole. If she's aware and lets it happen without further attempts to help, maybe yes. If she's already done her part by bringing it up, then no.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether she made her intentions clear and gave him enough time to act. Since they had tiffs and she brought it up, but he didn't follow through, she might not be at fault. However, not saying anything could be seen as not being supportive. But if she's already communicated and he's responsible, then she's not in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. Some people might think she should have done more, but others would say it's his responsibility.\n"
