I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The question is whether she's an asshole by not helping him and going alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, which is a long time. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which is a year before the trip in March. The deadline for renewing is approaching, and the author is considering not saying anything so he deals with the consequences.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The boyfriend has had over a year to get his passport renewed. The author has reminded him, but he didn't act. The cost was significant, $1000 each. Now, the author is deciding to let him face the consequences. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend is an adult and responsible for his own documents. The author did her part by reminding him. If he didn't take action despite multiple warnings, maybe he's at fault. The author might be justified in not wanting to enable his irresponsibility. However, maybe she could have set a deadline earlier, like before booking the trip. But she did book it, and now she's not helping. \n\nBut the question is about her being an asshole. If she's not helping, she's letting him face the natural consequences. On the other hand, maybe a partner should support each other in such situations. But the author mentions a mother-child dynamic, implying he's juvenile, so she might be trying to teach him a lesson. \n\nI think the key points are: boyfriend's responsibility, author's efforts to inform, and the timing. Since the deadline is now, and she's not planning to intervene, she's not in the wrong. So answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
