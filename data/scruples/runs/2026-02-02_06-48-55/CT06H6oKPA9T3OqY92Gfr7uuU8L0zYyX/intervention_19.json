I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. The trip was booked in November, costing $1000 each. The deadline for renewing is approaching, and the author is considering not helping, so if the boyfriend doesn't act, he'll miss the trip.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they feel like a parent to him, and he's being irresponsible. They want to let him deal with the consequences. But is that fair? \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is the one who didn't renew his passport despite repeated reminders. He's responsible for his own documents. The author did their part by warning him. So maybe the boyfriend is at fault here. \n\nOn the other hand, they are in a relationship, and going on a trip together. The author is choosing to go alone, which could be seen as abandoning the plan they made together. Even though the boyfriend is responsible for his passport, the author might have a responsibility to support the relationship. By not helping, they're letting him face the consequences, which could be harsh. \n\nBut the author has already tried multiple times to get him to renew it, even had arguments. So maybe they've done their part. If the boyfriend ignored all those warnings, the author isn't obligated to bail him out. However, the trip is a joint expense and a joint plan. Canceling the trip or not going at all might be an option, but going alone is another. \n\nIs it fair to let him miss out? Well, the author is not forcing him to go; they're just taking their own trip. But by doing so, they're also letting their own frustration and dynamic play out. The boyfriend's irresponsibility led to the problem, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried to help him more, like assisting in the renewal process. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. Since the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
