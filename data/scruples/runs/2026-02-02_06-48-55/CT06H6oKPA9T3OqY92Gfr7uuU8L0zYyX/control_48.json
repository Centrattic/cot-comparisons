I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, paid $1000 each. The passport deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the timeline and the responsibility. The passport was expired since 2018, which is a long time. The author mentioned bringing it up several times and even had tiffs. So the boyfriend had ample opportunity to renew his passport. The author's plan is to let him deal with the consequences, which could mean missing the trip. \n\nThe author's intention is to not intervene, even though they care about the boyfriend. The question is whether this makes them an asshole. On one hand, the boyfriend had the responsibility to renew his passport, and the author has tried to prompt him. On the other hand, maybe the author could have pushed harder, but given that they had conflicts and the boyfriend didn't act, maybe it's his own fault. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities are expected. However, some things are the individual's own responsibility, like official documents. If the author made it clear it was important and the boyfriend didn't act, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. Also, the financial aspect\u2014both paid for the trip. But the author is choosing to go alone, which might seem selfish, but if the boyfriend's negligence caused the problem, maybe not. \n\nPossible angles: Is the author responsible for his passport? No, usually each person is responsible for their own documentation. The author tried to help, but the boyfriend didn't follow through. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B (No).\n"
