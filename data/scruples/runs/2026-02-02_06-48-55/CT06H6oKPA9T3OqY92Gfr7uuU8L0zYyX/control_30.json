I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. So the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the user has mentioned it several times. They even had arguments about it. Now, they've booked a trip and paid $1000 each. The user is considering not doing anything if the boyfriend doesn't get his passport renewed in time, leaving him to miss the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The user brought up the passport issue multiple times. If the boyfriend wasn't taking action despite being reminded, maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. But maybe they should have pushed harder or helped him get it done. However, the couple had already booked the trip, so the user might feel that the responsibility is on the boyfriend now. \n\nAnother angle: the user is punishing the boyfriend for his own inaction. But is it fair to let him miss the trip alone? The user might be trying to teach him a lesson. However, the trip was a shared plan, and the user is using it as a consequence. The cost is also a factor\u2014$1000 is a lot, so maybe the user is trying to protect their investment by ensuring he's responsible.\n\nBut wait, if the user knew the deadline was approaching and didn't step in, maybe they're being passive-aggressive. The user might be using this as a way to assert control or express frustration about the dynamic in the relationship. However, if they didn't give him a final push, they might be seen as not helping enough. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned that the boyfriend can be juvenile and the dynamic feels like parent/child. So maybe the user is taking on a role where they're trying to enforce responsibility. But letting him miss the trip could be seen as holding his past behavior against him, which might not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't to blame if they've done their part in reminding him. The boyfriend failed to act, so the consequences are his own. The user isn't forcing him to go; he's the one who didn't take the necessary steps. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong here. \n\nBut some might argue that in a relationship, both partners should support each other in planning trips. If the user didn't take more active steps to help him get the passport, like accompanying him to the office or setting up reminders, they might share some responsibility. However, the user said they brought it up several times, which indicates they tried. \n\nIn the end, the user is choosing to let him face the consequences of his inaction, which could be a lesson. But it's also possible that the user is using this as a form of punishment for other issues in the relationship, not just the passport. The question is whether the user is in the wrong. If they did their part in communicating and the boyfriend didn't act, then the user isn't necessarily at fault. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
