      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been together over a year, planning a trip to another country in March. The boyfriend's passport expired in May 2018. The author has mentioned this issue multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked and paid $1000 each for the trip in November. The deadline for sending his passport in is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him handle the consequences if he doesn't renew it on time, so she can go on vacation alone.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong by doing that. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend has been neglecting his passport for a long time. The author tried multiple times to get him to renew it. He's described as juvenile, and the relationship sometimes feels like a mother-child dynamic. If he didn't take action despite her reminders, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely hers. She's making a choice to not intervene further, which could be seen as giving him a chance to grow, but also as abandoning him.\n\nOn the other hand, they booked a trip together, so maybe she has a duty to support each other. If she lets him face the consequences, he might not go, and she's going without him. Is it fair to hold him accountable for his own mistakes, even if it affects both of them? Or does her inaction make her complicit in the problem?\n\nAlso, financial aspect: They each paid $1000. If he doesn't go, she loses her money. But maybe he's responsible for his own documents, so it's his fault. However, she might feel it's her responsibility to ensure the trip happens since they planned it together.\n\nAnother angle: The author's intention is to let him deal with the consequences. If he's been warned multiple times and still didn't act, she's not necessarily in the wrong. But if she knew the deadline was approaching and didn't give him a final push, perhaps she's abdicating her role in supporting the relationship.\n\nBut the key point is that she's aware of the situation and chooses not to help. If she's been trying to manage his responsibilities for a while, maybe this is a way to enforce accountability. However, relationships often involve mutual support, so not helping could be seen as self-serving.\n\nIn terms of fairness, since the problem originated with the boyfriend's negligence, maybe she's justified in not wanting to take responsibility anymore. But by letting him miss the trip, she's making a decision that affects him, which might be harsh. However, she's also being honest about not wanting to be in a dynamic where she's the caretaker.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on whether she's shared the responsibility adequately. If she's made multiple attempts and he's ignored it, then she's not in the wrong. If she didn't do enough to help him renew, then maybe she is. But according to the scenario, she has brought it up several times, had tiffs, so she's tried. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
