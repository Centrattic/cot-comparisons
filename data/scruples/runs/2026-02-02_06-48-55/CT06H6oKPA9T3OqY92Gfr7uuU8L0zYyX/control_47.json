I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that his passport has been expired since 2018, and she mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which cost $1000 each. Now she's considering not helping him and just going alone if he doesn't get the passport sorted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners are responsible for their own travel documents, right? But maybe in a relationship, there's an expectation to support each other. She brought it up several times, so maybe she did her part. However, the passport is his responsibility. If he didn't act on her reminders, is she at fault? \n\nAlso, the cost. They paid a lot for the trip. If he can't go because he didn't renew his passport, they might lose the money. But she's choosing to go on her own. Is that selfish? Well, maybe she's frustrated with his irresponsibility. The question is whether she's an asshole for not helping him now. \n\nSome people might argue that she should have pushed harder or ensured he got it done, even if it meant being more aggressive. Others might say it's his responsibility, and she can't force him to act. The fact that they had tiffs shows there was conflict, but she still didn't take further action. \n\nSo, balancing the arguments: she did her part by reminding him multiple times. The passport is his to manage. If he didn't act, she can't be blamed for not stepping in at the last minute. However, choosing to go on the trip without him could be seen as letting him face consequences, which some might see as fair, others as cruel. But given that he's being irresponsible, maybe she's justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She tried to communicate, and the responsibility ultimately lies with him. Letting him deal with the consequences is reasonable.\n"
