It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has mentioned this several times, even had arguments over it. They booked the trip in November, which cost $1000 each. The deadline for renewing the passport is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him, so if he misses the deadline, she'll go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly frustrated because the boyfriend hasn't taken the responsibility to renew his passport despite being reminded multiple times. The boyfriend's lack of action led to this situation. But then, the author is planning to let him face the consequences without any support. Is that fair?\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the boyfriend should have taken care of his documents. However, in a relationship, especially one that's over a year, there's an expectation of support. But the author might feel that she's already given enough reminders and that he's not taking things seriously. She's trying to enforce accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting him off completely might be seen as harsh. Even if he's at fault, the author could help him get it done now, even if he's been neglectful. By not helping, she's making a choice that could leave him stranded. But maybe she's using this as a wake-up call. However, the financial loss is significant, and she's willing to go on the trip alone, which might be a valid choice if she's had enough of his irresponsibility.\n\nI should also consider the dynamic they mentioned\u2014feeling like a mother and child. That suggests a power imbalance, and maybe the author has been overstepping by trying to manage everything. But in this case, the passport is his responsibility. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's been clear and he ignored it, maybe she's justified. But if she could still assist him now, even without his previous cooperation, she might be adding to the problem. However, her decision to not intervene is a choice to let him face the consequences, which could be fair if he's been negligent. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. She's not in the wrong because ultimately, renewing a passport is his responsibility. If he failed to act despite her reminders, she has the right to let him handle it now, even if it means he misses the trip. Her decision to go on the trip alone is a consequence he must face for his own inaction.\n"
