I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They've even had arguments about it. Now, with the trip booked and the deadline approaching, she's considering not helping him and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should share responsibilities, especially when planning something important like an international trip. The boyfriend's passport expiration is his issue, but since it affects both of them, maybe the author has a duty to remind or assist more. However, the author has already tried multiple times without success, leading to arguments.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. They both paid $1000 each, so she might feel that her money is being wasted if he doesn't go. But is it fair to let him miss the trip to teach a lesson? That could be seen as harsh, especially if the boyfriend is solely responsible for the passport. On the other hand, she might feel she's done her part and can't be blamed if he doesn't act.\n\nThe user also mentions a mother-child dynamic, which suggests a power imbalance. Maybe she's been taking on more responsibility than him. If she's been the one pushing for renewal and he's neglected it despite her efforts, then she's not entirely at fault. However, the trip is a joint commitment, so both should have ensured all documents were in order. \n\nLegally, she can't be forced to wait for him, but morally, it's a gray area. She might argue she's not at fault since it's his passport, but others might see it as her responsibility to ensure he's prepared, given the previous warnings. The key points are repeated reminders, failed attempts to resolve, and the personal choice to proceed without him. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because the responsibility for the passport lies with him. However, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so she should have helped more. But since she's made efforts and he didn't act, she's probably not the asshole. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
