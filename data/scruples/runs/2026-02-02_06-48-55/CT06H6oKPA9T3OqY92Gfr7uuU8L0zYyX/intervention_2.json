I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport ruin their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author kept bringing it up but he didn't renew it. They booked a trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. The author plans to let him deal with the consequences and go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should share responsibilities, especially for plans that affect both. However, the boyfriend has been neglecting his responsibility to renew his passport despite multiple reminders, leading to conflicts. The author is frustrated and feels like she's in a parent-child dynamic. \n\nIs it fair for her to take no action? Well, by not intervening, she's allowing him to face the consequences of his inaction. But since the trip is a joint booking and payment, maybe she should have stepped in sooner. However, she did try multiple times and even had arguments about it. \n\nThe question is if she's in the wrong for not helping him get it done now. If she had a responsibility to ensure he got it done, then not doing so could be seen as neglecting her share. But if the responsibility was his from the start and she's already taken steps to inform him, then maybe she's not at fault. \n\nAlso, the trip was booked with both names and paid for by both. If she goes alone, he loses his investment and the opportunity. But she's not forcing him to go; he's responsible for his own documents. \n\nOn one hand, she could be seen as holding him accountable. On the other, maybe she should have helped him renew the passport when she realized the deadline was approaching. But she says she's not going to say anything, so it's passive-aggressive. \n\nIn AITA threads, people often consider both parties' actions. The boyfriend is clearly responsible for his passport, but the author could be seen as not supporting him enough. However, if she tried and he repeatedly ignored it, then maybe she's not at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the main responsibility lies with the boyfriend. The author tried to communicate and even had conflicts. If he didn't act, she's not entirely to blame. However, some might argue she could have helped more. But given the context, she's not in the wrong.\n"
