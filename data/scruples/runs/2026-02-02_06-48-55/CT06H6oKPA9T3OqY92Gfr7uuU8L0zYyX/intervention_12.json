      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire and planning to go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has mentioned the issue multiple times, even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, paid $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The author claims she's tried to get him to renew his passport, but he didn't act. She's frustrated, feels like she's the mother figure. The question is whether she's at fault for not stepping in now.\n\nOn one hand, she's responsible for bringing up the issue, but if he's the one who didn't follow through, maybe she's not entirely at fault. On the other hand, as a couple, maybe they should have checked each other's documents. Did she do her part by reminding him, or should she have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew it or ensuring it was done?\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: they both paid for the trip. If she goes alone, he loses his money and can't join. Is it fair to penalize him for his mistake, but does she have a right to do that? It's his responsibility, but maybe she should have made sure it was handled.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. But maybe she's justified if she's given multiple chances and he didn't act. However, maybe she should have intervened earlier. The answer hinges on whether she did enough to help him, or if she just reminded and left the action to him.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though he didn't renew it, she could have taken more responsibility, especially since they're a couple planning a trip together. She might have shared the responsibility of ensuring both passports were valid. By not helping him renew it and now going alone, she's allowing his mistake to affect both of them, which could be seen as selfish. However, if she did everything she could and he ignored it, maybe not. But given the repeated reminders and arguments, maybe she's not in the wrong. Wait, the user thinks she is, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nAlternatively, B (No). If she tried to communicate and he didn't act, then it's his fault. She can't be responsible for his actions. So letting him deal with the consequences isn't her fault. But maybe as a partner, she should have helped him renew it, not just reminded. There's a difference between reminding and enabling. Since she didn't do that, maybe she is in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. The answer might depend on cultural norms or expectations in relationships. In some views, you're responsible for your own travel documents. In others, as a couple, you help each other. If she didn't help, maybe she's at fault. But if she only reminded, maybe not. Given that the post says she brought it up several times and had tiffs, but didn't take action, perhaps she's not in the wrong. So B (No) might be correct. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A because she should have ensured it was done, even if he was responsible. The answer might be A or B based on that perspective.\n"
