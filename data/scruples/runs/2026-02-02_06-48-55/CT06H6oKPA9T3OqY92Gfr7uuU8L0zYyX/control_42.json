I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They had arguments about it, and they booked the trip in November. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him and going on the trip alone.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend was responsible for renewing his passport, the author reminded him several times, and he didn't act. The author is now planning to leave him to deal with the consequences. The main question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend neglected his responsibility. The author tried to make him aware multiple times. On the other hand, maybe the author could have helped him more, but the question is whether she's in the wrong for not doing so. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities can be tricky. If one person consistently ignores important tasks despite being reminded, it's reasonable to hold them accountable. The author isn't forcing him to go; she's letting him take responsibility for his inaction. \n\nAlso, the trip was a mutual booking, so both should have ensured all documentation was in order. If he didn't act, then the consequences are on him. The author isn't preventing him from going; she's just not helping. So, she's not the asshole here. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
