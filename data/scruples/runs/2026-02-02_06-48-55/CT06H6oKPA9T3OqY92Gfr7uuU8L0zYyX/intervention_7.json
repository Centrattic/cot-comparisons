It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip they booked together.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has brought up the issue multiple times, even had arguments. They paid $1000 each for a trip in March. The deadline to renew the passport is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and letting him deal with the consequences, potentially going on the trip alone.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's responsibility here. They've tried reminding him, but it's the boyfriend's responsibility to renew his own passport. However, maybe they should have followed up more or taken some action to ensure it got done. The cost is a factor too\u2014both invested money, so maybe the author feels they're not responsible for his mistake. But is it fair to leave him hanging after multiple warnings?\n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned is a mother-child one, suggesting possible immaturity from the boyfriend. But that doesn't absolve the author of any responsibility. Maybe they should have set up a system or check-ins to make sure he renewed it. But ultimately, passport renewal is his legal duty. The author isn't legally obligated to cover that. \n\nHowever, in a relationship, there's an expectation of support. If they're a team, maybe the author should have helped him renew the passport, like reminding him in specific ways or even assisting in the process. But the author says they brought it up several times and he didn't act. So maybe the boyfriend is at fault for not taking the necessary steps despite being warned.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is being negligent. If they did their part by reminding and he didn't act, then the blame is on him. But if the author could have done more to ensure it got done, maybe they share some responsibility. However, the author's response is to let him face the consequences, which is a valid approach if they've done their part. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
