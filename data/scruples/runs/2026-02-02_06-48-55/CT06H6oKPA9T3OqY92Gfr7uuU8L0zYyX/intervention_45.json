      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The question is whether they should be considered an asshole for not helping him and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a trip planned in March, and the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned this issue multiple times, even had arguments about it. They even paid $1000 each for the trip. The deadline to get the passport renewed is approaching, and the author is planning to go on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get it together.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to analyze if the author is at fault here. Let me break it down.\n\nPassport renewal is the individual's responsibility. The boyfriend, despite being reminded multiple times, didn't act on it. The author tried to communicate and even had conflicts about it. The trip was booked in November, which gives time to handle the passport. However, the author's decision to not intervene and let the boyfriend face the consequences might be seen as a way to hold him accountable for his responsibility. But since they paid together, the author might be abandoning the trip, leading to financial loss for both.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is responsible for his own documents. On the other hand, the author is paying for the trip, and leaving him behind could be seen as selfish or harsh, especially if they had planned it together. However, the author might feel frustrated with the boyfriend's lack of responsibility, leading to the decision.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being fair. The boyfriend's inaction caused the problem, but the author could have taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew the passport or seeking alternatives. By not doing anything, the author is letting the boyfriend face the consequences, which might be a lesson. However, it also means losing the trip cost, which could be a significant financial hit. The author might be using this as a lesson, but it's a harsh way to handle it, especially if the boyfriend's irresponsibility is a recurring issue.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require compromise. If the author is prioritizing their own plans over helping the boyfriend, even though it's his fault, it might be seen as not supporting the relationship. However, if the boyfriend is juvenile and the author feels like a parent, maybe the author is trying to enforce accountability. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the responsibility is on the boyfriend. The author did their part by reminding him. But maybe they could have done more, like helping him submit the application. If the author didn't, they might be partially responsible. But if they tried and he didn't act, then it's his fault.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is an asshole. The author's reasoning is that they're not helping, so the boyfriend misses out. The answer depends on whether the author is being reasonable in their approach. If the author is taking a passive-aggressive approach instead of helping, maybe they are in the wrong. But if they've done their part and the boyfriend didn't, then maybe not.\n\nI think the key here is that the author could have helped more, but since they didn't, they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if they did all they could, maybe not. The original post says they've brought it up several times and had tiffs. So the author tried to communicate, but didn't help him with the actual process. Maybe they could have helped, but didn't. So the author's inaction might be their fault.\n\nBut the boyfriend is responsible for his own documents. So the answer is a bit tricky. If the author is not helping beyond reminding, maybe they are not at fault. If they had the chance to help and didn't, maybe they are. It's a gray area. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the boyfriend is responsible, the author could have taken more steps to help him, like assisting in the renewal process, which they didn't do. Instead, they chose to abandon the trip, leading to financial loss. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the responsibility is on the boyfriend. But if the author could have helped more, then they share some blame. I'm a bit torn here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if one person's inaction leads to a problem that affects both, they might be considered at fault. But since the passport is his, it's his responsibility. However, the author could have stepped in. Maybe the answer is A because they didn't take active steps to resolve it, just let it happen. Alternatively, they did their part. \n\nHmm. I think the final answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they could have helped more instead of just not saying anything and letting things happen. They have agency to help, even if it's his responsibility. So by not helping, they share some blame.\n"
