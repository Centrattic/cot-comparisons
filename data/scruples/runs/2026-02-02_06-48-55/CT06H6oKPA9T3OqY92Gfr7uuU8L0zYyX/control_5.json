I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. The author plans to go on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get his passport sorted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The author has clearly tried to address the issue before, so maybe they've done their part. But is it their responsibility to handle the passport renewal? Passport renewals are individual responsibilities, right? Unless they have a specific agreement where one person is looking after the other's documents. But in this case, the boyfriend was supposed to take care of it, and the author has been reminding him. \n\nThe author is now considering not helping further, leading to the boyfriend's possible exclusion from the trip. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend neglected his own responsibilities despite being reminded, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, the trip was booked together, so perhaps the author should have ensured both passports were valid before booking. But the user says they booked it in November, and the boyfriend's passport was already expired. So the author might have been aware of the problem at the time of booking but proceeded anyway, hoping he'd renew it. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't take action to help after repeated reminders, maybe they are partially responsible. But the key here is that passport renewal is the individual's responsibility. The author can't be held fully accountable if the boyfriend didn't act. However, since they are in a relationship and planning a joint trip, there's an expectation of mutual support. The author might be seen as abandoning the boyfriend now, but if the boyfriend didn't take action despite being told multiple times, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: the trip cost $1000 each. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses his money, but the author is the one who paid? Or did they split the cost? The scenario says they booked and paid for the trip, so maybe both paid. If the author is going alone, the boyfriend's portion is wasted, but the author isn't necessarily the one at fault if the boyfriend didn't take responsibility. \n\nSo the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend was responsible for his own passport and didn't act despite reminders. The author tried to help and now is letting the consequences happen. However, some might argue that in a relationship, you should assist each other more directly, but generally, passport renewals are personal. So leaning towards B.\n"
