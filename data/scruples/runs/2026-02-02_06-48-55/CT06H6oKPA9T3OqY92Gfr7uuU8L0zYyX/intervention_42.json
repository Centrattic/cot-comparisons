I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person's boyfriend has an expired passport since 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it. They booked a trip costing $1000 each, and now she's considering letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get his passport done on time, so she can go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The boyfriend's passport has been expired for years. Even after multiple reminders and arguments, he hasn't taken action. The author has tried to communicate and even had conflicts about it. The trip is already booked, paid for, and the deadline is near. \n\nNow, the author is contemplating not helping or reminding him anymore, essentially letting him handle it himself. The question is whether this makes her an asshole. \n\nOn one hand, she's trying to hold him accountable for his own responsibilities. He's an adult, and the passport renewal is his responsibility. She's already given multiple chances and reminders. By not helping further, she's not necessarily being cruel, just setting boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have intervened more. But the problem is that the responsibility lies with him. She's not legally or ethically obligated to take responsibility for his inaction. Relationships do require support, but there's a line where you can't force someone to take action. If she's already communicated her concerns and he hasn't acted, her hands might be tied. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a point. The trip is expensive, and she's not willing to let him miss it because of his own negligence. She's choosing to take responsibility for her own actions by going alone. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's holding him accountable for his part. The main issue is the boyfriend's failure to act despite multiple reminders. The author's decision, while harsh, is a consequence of his inaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
