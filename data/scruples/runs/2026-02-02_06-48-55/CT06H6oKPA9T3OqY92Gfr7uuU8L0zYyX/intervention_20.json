It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly.

I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the scenario again. The user is asking if it's \"asshole territory\" for them to let their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, which is about a year before the March trip, and now the deadline is near. The author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences, meaning she might go on the trip alone if he doesn't get his passport sorted.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author has known about the expired passport for a while. They've tried to address it, even had fights. They've paid a significant amount for the trip. Now, they're thinking of not intervening as a form of letting him take responsibility. The question is whether she's in the wrong by doing that.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author has tried to communicate, but the boyfriend hasn't acted. Maybe she didn't follow up enough? Or maybe she did enough, and it's his responsibility. But since they made a joint decision to book the trip, both are responsible for meeting the requirements. However, the author is punishing him by not helping, even though they're both responsible for the trip's logistics.\n\nOn one hand, the author could be seen as holding him accountable for his own actions. If she's been reminding him and he ignored it, maybe she's justified in not bailing him out. On the other hand, in a relationship, sometimes you support each other even if one person isn't proactive. By letting him face the consequences, she might be being fair, but also potentially heartless if he's not prepared.\n\nFinancially, they both paid for the trip. If she goes without him, maybe they split the cost, but he loses his investment. Is that fair? It's a big expense, so she might feel it's his own fault. However, in a relationship, sometimes you make sacrifices for the other person, especially if you've been in a serious relationship for over a year.\n\nAlso, the power dynamic mentioned (feeling like a mother and child) suggests that maybe the author feels like she's always taking charge. Maybe this is a way to push him to take responsibility. But is it right to withhold support when both are responsible for the trip's planning?\n\nI think there's a middle ground. Maybe she should have given one last reminder or helped him get it done. But if she's already tried multiple times and he didn't act, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether she did everything she could to help him, or if she just nagged and then let it go. If she's done her part in communication and he's inattentive, then she's not entirely at fault. However, by choosing not to help, she's letting him face the consequences, which could be seen as harsh but maybe justified. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe she should have taken more proactive steps to ensure his passport was renewed, making her complicit in some way. Hmm.\n"
