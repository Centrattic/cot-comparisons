      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport expired, and the author is considering letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time for the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple has been together over a year, and they've booked a trip that's already paid for, costing $1000 each. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times, even leading to arguments. Now, the deadline to renew is approaching, and the author is thinking of not reminding him and going on the trip alone.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole (ITA) if they let him miss the trip. From a moral standpoint, the author has a responsibility as a partner to support each other in making plans work. Even though the boyfriend hasn't taken action, the author might feel frustrated. However, the trip was a joint booking and payment. If the boyfriend's passport isn't renewed, he can't go, and the author is considering not helping him. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has already tried to get him to renew the passport. They've had arguments about it. The author is now choosing to let him face the consequences. The key point here is whether the author should have taken further action. If they had, for example, helped him renew the passport or at least reminded him again, maybe the situation would have been different. However, the author is now choosing to step back and not intervene. \n\nOn one hand, the author could be seen as being inconsiderate by not helping, especially since they paid a lot of money. On the other hand, the boyfriend's inaction might have been his own fault. The author might feel that after multiple reminders and arguments, they can't be held responsible anymore. \n\nBut in a relationship, some level of support is expected. The author might have a right to be frustrated, but letting the boyfriend miss the trip without any help could be seen as harsh. The author is punishing him for his inaction, which might not be fair. However, the boyfriend's responsibility to maintain his documents is his own, and the author can't be expected to force him. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the interpretation. If the author had provided support or reminders, maybe it's less about being an asshole. But since they're choosing to do nothing, it could be seen as abandoning the shared plan. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because the author is contributing to the problem by not helping further, even though the boyfriend is at fault. But the answer could also be B if the author is justified in letting him take responsibility.\n"
