I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire, leading to him missing a trip they both paid for. The boyfriend has an expired passport since May 2018, and the author has tried to get him to renew it, even arguing about it. They've paid $1000 each for the trip in March. The author is considering not helping and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The boyfriend's passport was expired long before the trip, so he's responsible for that. However, the author has brought it up multiple times. But the trip was booked in November, so the author should have known the deadline for passport renewal. Passport renewal takes time, so there's a window during which they could have acted. \n\nThe author is now planning to go on the trip alone, which is expensive. The question is whether they're at fault. The boyfriend failed to renew his passport, but the author might share some responsibility for not ensuring it was done. However, the author has tried to get him to do it. \n\nIf the author had known the deadline and the boyfriend still didn't act, maybe the author is within their rights to go alone. But the author might be blamed for not following up more strictly, like helping with the process or setting reminders. On the other hand, the boyfriend is an adult and responsible for his own documents. \n\nThere's also the dynamic mentioned\u2014feeling like a mother-child. That might indicate some imbalance in responsibility, but it's not directly relevant to fault here. The key is whether the author's inaction is justified. Since the author tried to communicate and the boyfriend didn't act, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the author could be seen as abandoning the trip they both paid for, which might be seen as selfish. \n\nBut the boyfriend's own failure is the root cause. If the author had warned him earlier or helped him with the process, maybe it's different. Since they didn't, maybe the author is partially at fault. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether they share responsibility. Since the author tried to remind but didn't enforce action, maybe they are partially to blame. But the main fault is the boyfriend's. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they could have taken more proactive steps to ensure the passport was renewed, like helping him with it. But if the author did their part and the boyfriend didn't, then maybe B. Hmm. It's a bit of a grey area. The author's inaction might be seen as not taking enough responsibility for a shared trip. So maybe A.\n"
