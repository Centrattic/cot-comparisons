I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author and her boyfriend are going on a trip in March. His passport expired in May 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it multiple times, even arguing about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip, and the deadline is approaching for him to get his passport renewed in time. She's considering not helping him and just going on the trip alone if he doesn't get it together.\n\nFirst, I should consider their relationship dynamics. She mentions that he's been juvenile and she often feels like a parent. That might mean she's been taking on a caretaker role. However, when it comes to something critical like a passport, which is necessary for international travel, both parties have responsibility. She's been bringing it up, but maybe he's not listening. \n\nBut wait, even if she's been reminding him, the fact that his passport expired in 2018 is on him. It's his responsibility to maintain his own travel documents. She can't be held responsible for his negligence. On the other hand, she's been involved in the planning and paid for the trip, so maybe she's shared the financial responsibility. However, the passport is his personal responsibility. \n\nIs it fair for her to let him face the consequences? If she's been proactive in reminding him and he's ignored it, then she's not the one at fault. However, if she's been nagging him and he's not acted, but she still has a duty to help him at the last minute, maybe she should? But that might not be fair either. \n\nAlso, the cost is a factor. If the trip is non-refundable, she might lose the money. But she might be choosing to prioritize her own stress and time over his. But since the passport is his responsibility, maybe she's justified in not helping further. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if she's been clear and he hasn't taken action, then she's not the one at fault. But if she's been in denial about the problem and only now realizing, maybe she's at fault. But the situation says she's been bringing it up multiple times. \n\nI think the key here is that the passport is his responsibility. She did her part by reminding him, and now he's the one who didn't act. So she's not in the wrong for not helping further and going on the trip alone. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
