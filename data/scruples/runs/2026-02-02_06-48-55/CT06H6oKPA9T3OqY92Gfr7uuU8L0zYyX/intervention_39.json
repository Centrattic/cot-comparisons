It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned it several times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for a trip in March. The deadline is approaching, and the author plans to go alone if he doesn't renew it in time. The author is conflicted but wants to know if they're an asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior warnings, the boyfriend's responsibility, financial investment, and the author's justification for not helping further. The author has tried to communicate the issue, but the boyfriend didn't act. The question is whether the author is wrong for letting him face the consequences.\n\nOn one hand, the author did their part by bringing it up multiple times. The boyfriend had the responsibility to renew his passport. The author is now choosing to hold him accountable. On the other hand, some might argue that being in a relationship means supporting each other, and maybe the author should have stepped in more, like helping with the renewal process or even financially if needed.\n\nBut the author has already tried to address it and the boyfriend didn't act. The author is now taking a firm stance, which some might see as justified. Others might think that the author is being cold by not helping further, especially given the significant expense involved.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and typical expectations in relationships. In many cases, both partners are expected to contribute to planning trips. However, if one partner repeatedly ignores responsibilities, the other might feel justified in not covering for them. The author's decision could be seen as teaching accountability, but it could also be viewed as selfish if the author is prioritizing their own plans without considering the boyfriend's possible reliance on them.\n\nAnother angle: the financial aspect. They both paid $1000 each. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses his money and the trip. Is the author being fair? It's possible the author feels that since the boyfriend didn't take responsibility, he should bear the cost. However, some might argue that the author should not have booked the trip without confirming the passport status first.\n\nAlso, the dynamic the author mentions\u2014feeling like a mother figure\u2014might influence their decision. They might be tired of taking care of the boyfriend's responsibilities and want to assert independence.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the author did their part to warn and the boyfriend didn't act, the author isn't entirely at fault. However, some might say the author should have intervened more. But given the information, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
