I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend whose passport expired in 2018, and the author is considering letting him deal with the consequences of not renewing it in time for a trip they booked together. The author has mentioned the issue before, even arguing about it, and now is thinking of going on the trip alone if he doesn't get it sorted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend has had an expired passport for over four years, which is a long time. The author has brought it up multiple times, suggesting she's tried to communicate the importance of renewing it. They even had arguments about it. The trip was booked in November, which is a few months before the departure in March. The author is contemplating not helping him at all and going on the trip alone if he doesn't act. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong by doing that. On one hand, she tried to address the issue, and he didn't take action. On the other, relationships often require compromise and support. Letting him face the consequences could be seen as holding him accountable, but leaving him out of the trip entirely might be harsh, especially since they both booked it. However, she's also paying for her own trip, so she's not wasting his money if he doesn't go. \n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to punish him for his own oversight? She might feel frustrated, and maybe he's not taking responsibilities seriously. But cutting off support entirely could be a way of expressing her own limits. However, the financial aspect is a factor. She paid $1000 each, so if he can't go, she loses her money. But maybe she's willing to accept that.\n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned (mother and child) might indicate that he's been neglecting responsibilities, which she's now addressing. But is it her responsibility to ensure he renews his passport? That's a personal responsibility he should handle. However, as a partner, there might be an expectation of helping each other with such matters.\n\nIn terms of accountability, if he's been told multiple times and ignored it, then she's not at fault. But if she had the means to help him (like accompanying him to renew) and didn't, that might be different. However, the scenario doesn't mention that she offered help beyond mentioning it. So she might be holding him responsible for his own actions, which is reasonable.\n\nBut leaving him out of the trip could be seen as a harsh punishment. Maybe a middle ground would be better, like helping him get the passport done before the trip. However, she's choosing not to intervene, which could be justified if she's had enough of his irresponsible behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because she tried to address the issue, he was responsible for his passport, and she's now choosing to let him face the consequences for his own inaction. It's a tough call, but accountability is important. She's not obligated to cover for his mistakes, especially after multiple warnings.\n"
