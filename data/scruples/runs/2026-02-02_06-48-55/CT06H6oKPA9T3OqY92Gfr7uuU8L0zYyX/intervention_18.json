It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire, leading to the boyfriend missing a trip they both paid for.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They had arguments about it. Now, they've booked a trip in March, and the deadline to send the passport for renewal is approaching. The author is planning not to mention it anymore and let the boyfriend handle the consequences, meaning he might miss the trip. The author is considering whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nI should consider responsibility in a relationship. The author did try to bring it up several times and had arguments. But ultimately, the responsibility for renewing a passport lies with the individual. However, since they are a couple and both paid for the trip, maybe the author should have taken more action, like helping him renew it or not booking the trip if he wasn't responsible. But the author might feel frustrated due to the boyfriend's juvenile behavior. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author do enough? They brought it up multiple times, which shows they tried. If the boyfriend ignored it despite knowing the consequences, he's responsible. However, the author could have set a firm deadline earlier, maybe even without going on the trip if the passport wasn't renewed. But they went ahead and booked it, so maybe they share some responsibility because they knew the risk. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not intervening further. If the boyfriend's passport was his responsibility, the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, in a relationship, sometimes you have to take more proactive steps. But the author might feel they've done their part. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author tried to communicate the issue repeatedly. If the boyfriend didn't act, maybe he's at fault. But the author could have been more proactive in ensuring the passport was renewed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they didn't push further beyond what they did, maybe they aren't. So the answer might be B (not wrong), but I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, the trip is a shared expense, so the author is also affected. If they go on the trip alone, the boyfriend loses the money, but the author loses money and the trip experience. However, the author might see it as a consequence for his irresponsibility. \n\nBut some might argue that in a relationship, supporting each other is important. The author might be punishing the boyfriend for his own mistake, which could be seen as harsh. But if the author has already tried multiple times and given chances, maybe it's justified. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not wrong) because the responsibility for official documents like a passport is on the individual. The author tried to communicate, but the boyfriend didn't act. The author isn't obligated to take over the responsibility entirely. However, if the author was the one who booked the trip, maybe they should have considered the boyfriend's responsibility. But the trip was a joint decision. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call, but I think the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
