      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're going on a trip in March. His passport has been expired since May 2018. She's brought up the issue multiple times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip. The deadline to renew his passport is approaching, and she's planning to not help him anymore, let him deal with the consequences, and go on the trip alone.\n\nThe question is whether she's an asshole (AITA) for doing that. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nLet me think about the factors here. The boyfriend's responsibility: he's been neglecting to renew his passport for a long time. The author has tried to bring it up, even had conflicts. That shows she's been proactive. But maybe she should have taken more steps to ensure it got done, like helping him through the process? But wait, the boyfriend is an adult, so maybe the responsibility is his. However, they're in a relationship, and sometimes couples help each other with such tasks. \n\nThe trip was booked in November, which gives time. The deadline is approaching now. She's decided to step back and let him handle it, but if he doesn't, she'll go alone. Is that fair? On one hand, she's not forcing him to come; he's the one who didn't take responsibility. On the other hand, maybe she should have pushed harder, maybe taken over the process if he wasn't responding. But if he's been juvenile and resistant to help, maybe she's justified in stepping back.\n\nAlso, the cost is $1000 each. If he can't go, she loses her money. But maybe she's being selfish by going without him? Or is she standing up for herself? The dynamic she mentioned (mother-child) suggests that he's been difficult to deal with, which might justify her decision.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even in a relationship, each person is responsible for their own documents. So if he neglected his passport, he's at fault. But she knew about it for over a year and didn't take action. Maybe she should have intervened more. However, if she's been nagging and he's ignoring her, maybe she's done her part. \n\nSo, the key points: He's responsible for his passport, she's tried to help, but he's not taking it seriously. She's now stepping back because he's not acting. Is she in the wrong? If she's given him multiple chances and he hasn't acted, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she had the means to force him to renew it (like paying for it), but didn't, maybe she is. But the renewal is his responsibility. So, perhaps she's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, some might say that in a relationship, you support each other, and she should have ensured he renewed it even if he didn't want to. But if he's been juvenile and she's been in a mother-child dynamic, maybe she's justified in stepping back. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's holding him accountable for his own responsibilities, even though it's a tough situation.\n"
