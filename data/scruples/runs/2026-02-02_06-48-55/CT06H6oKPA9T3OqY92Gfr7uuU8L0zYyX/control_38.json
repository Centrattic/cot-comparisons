I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it. They had even had some arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. The author is considering not helping and letting him deal with the consequences, which would mean he can't go on the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should be proactive about their own responsibilities, especially something as important as a passport for a trip. The boyfriend should have taken the initiative to renew his passport, especially after multiple reminders. But maybe the author should have followed up more or set specific deadlines. However, she did bring it up several times and even had tiffs about it. \n\nThe cost of the trip is $1000 each, so letting him miss the trip would mean losing that money. But is it fair to hold her responsible for his negligence? Or is it his own fault for not taking action despite being reminded? \n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned is that he's juvenile and she feels like a mother. That might indicate that she's taking on more responsibility than he is. But if she's been clear and he still didn't act, maybe she's justified in not bailing him out now. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if she had a role in planning the trip and he's responsible for his own documents, then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, in a relationship, there's often mutual support expected. But this seems like a personal responsibility that he neglected. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because the responsibility lies with him to renew his passport. She did her part by reminding him, so she's not in the wrong for not helping now. However, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other through mistakes, but this is a case of repeated negligence. \n\nI think the key is that he was informed multiple times, and it's his responsibility. She's not the one who should be held accountable for his inaction beyond a reasonable point. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
