I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and she's mentioned it several times. They even had arguments about it. Now they've booked the trip, paid $1000 each, and the deadline is coming up for him to renew his passport. The author is considering not helping him and letting him miss the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should share responsibilities, especially when planning something big like an international trip. The author brought it up multiple times, so maybe the boyfriend didn't take it seriously. But she's also not helping him now, which could be seen as abandoning him. \n\nFinancial responsibility is another angle. They both paid for the trip, so she's losing money if he doesn't go. But is it fair to charge him for this? The author might feel she's been trying to make him act responsibly, and now she's punishing him for not listening. \n\nEmotional factors: The user mentioned the boyfriend can be juvenile, and she feels like a mother figure. That dynamic might mean she's taken on more responsibility than he has. However, letting him face the consequences could teach him a lesson. But is it fair to her to be the one who's left out?\n\nEthically, is she wrong? If the boyfriend didn't act on her warnings, maybe she's not entirely at fault. However, in a relationship, supporting each other is important. By not helping, she's not supporting him, which could be seen as selfish. But some might argue she's holding him accountable.\n\nLegally, if they're both adults, each is responsible for their own documents. So she's not legally at fault. Emotionally, though, she might carry guilt if she leaves him in a lurch. \n\nThe key points are: Did she do enough to help him? She mentioned it multiple times, so maybe she did. But now, by not helping further, is she being unfair? It's a tough call. Some might say she's justified if he didn't listen. Others might say she should have helped him more, even if he was being irresponsible. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether she had a responsibility to keep pushing him beyond her initial efforts. If she tried multiple times and he still didn't act, then she's not entirely at fault. However, if she could have done more to assist him (like accompanying him to the passport office), maybe she did drop the ball. But given the information, she tried. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
