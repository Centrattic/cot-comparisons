      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The options are A for yes (she's in the wrong) and B for no (she's not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship with her boyfriend for over a year. They're planning a trip in March, and he hasn't renewed his passport since 2018. She's mentioned this issue multiple times, even had some arguments about it. They booked and paid for the trip in November. Now, the deadline for him to get his passport renewed is approaching, and she's considering not saying anything and letting him handle it if he doesn't get it done, resulting in her going alone.\n\nThe key points here are: the boyfriend's responsibility in renewing his passport, the author's attempts to address the issue, and her decision to let the consequences happen if he doesn't act. \n\nIn relationships, there's a shared responsibility for planning and preparing for trips. However, passport renewal is an individual responsibility. The author has tried to communicate and even had conflicts about it. But maybe she could have taken more proactive steps, like helping him process the renewal, setting reminders, or maybe even going with him to the embassy. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is an adult and should be responsible for his own documents. The author might feel frustrated that he's not taking it seriously, leading to the mother-child dynamic she mentioned. Letting him face the consequences could be seen as holding him accountable for his own actions. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If she's aware of the problem and the stakes, maybe she should have done more to ensure he took action. However, if she's already done what she could and he's still not acting, then maybe she's not at fault. The cost of the trip is significant, and she might not want to cancel it. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. Some might argue that she should have been more proactive in helping, while others might say she's justified in letting him take responsibility. The question is whether her inaction makes her the asshole. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether she did everything possible to ensure he renewed his passport. If she just told him and didn't follow up or help, maybe she could be in the wrong. If she made multiple attempts and he ignored them, then she's not. The fact that she even asked here shows she's considering the consequences. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author has made multiple attempts to address the issue. The responsibility ultimately lies with the boyfriend. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
