      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's expired passport and whether they're being an asshole by not helping him get it renewed in time for their trip. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018. The author has brought it up several times and even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author plans to let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't act in time, meaning she'll go alone.\n\nHmm. The key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, but the author has tried multiple times to get him to renew it. However, she's also aware of his juvenile behavior and the dynamic they have. She's planning to let him face the consequences, which could mean losing the money and missing the trip. \n\nIs she at fault? Well, she tried to get him to take action but maybe didn't follow up in a way that ensured he'd do it. But on the other hand, she's not his parent, even though she feels the mother-child dynamic. She's making a choice to take responsibility for her own actions, which is understandable. But maybe she could have done more to help, like setting a specific time to go with him or maybe even helping pay for the renewal. But she already paid for the trip, so maybe she's done her part.\n\nWait, the trip is paid for by both, so she's risking her own money too. If he doesn't get the passport, she might not get a refund. So maybe she's trying to hold him accountable. But is it fair to let him miss out because he didn't act? She did warn him, but maybe it's a bit harsh. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she should have set a firm deadline earlier and enforced it. But considering he's responsible for his own documents, perhaps she's not entirely at fault. The fact that she's letting him face the consequences could be seen as fair, but it's also possible that she should have intervened more. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, she's responsible and wants him to take accountability. On the other hand, maybe she should have stepped in more. But given that he's been ignoring it for over a year despite multiple reminders, maybe she's justified in not helping further. So maybe answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
