I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The author's boyfriend hasn't renewed his passport since 2018, and she's been nagging him about it. They had a fight, paid for the trip, and now the deadline is approaching. She's considering not helping him and letting him deal with the consequences, possibly missing the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's at fault. The key points here are responsibility and communication. The author mentions she's brought it up several times, and even had fights over it. The boyfriend's passport has been expired for a long time, which is his responsibility. However, she's in a relationship dynamic where she might feel like a mother, which could indicate he's not taking responsibility.\n\nBut wait, even if the passport is his responsibility, she's planning a trip together. If she knew the deadline was approaching and didn't step in, is she being negligent? On the other hand, she's paid a lot of money, and maybe she's frustrated with his lack of responsibility. She might feel justified in not helping anymore after repeated failures.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require teamwork. Even if it's his passport, maybe she should have followed up more strictly or set consequences earlier. But she did bring it up multiple times. The question is whether she's responsible for his actions. If she's aware of the deadline and doesn't act, she could be seen as letting him off the hook, which might not be fair. But if he's consistently irresponsible, maybe it's his fault.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the responsibility lies solely with him. If she's not at fault for not forcing him to act, then she's not the asshole. But if she had the means to help him (like accompanying him to renew it) and didn't, maybe she is. However, the user says she's not going to say anything, which might be passive-aggressive. Letting him figure it out alone could be seen as abandoning him, but if he's responsible, she's not in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The answer is likely B (No), because the passport is his responsibility. But maybe A (Yes) if she should have helped more. I think in this case, since she tried multiple times and he didn't act, she's not the one at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
