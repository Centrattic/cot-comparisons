I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. So, the situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it several times. They even had some arguments about it. Now, they've booked a trip and the deadline for the passport renewal is approaching. The author is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't get his act together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners usually share responsibilities, especially when planning a trip. The author has been nagging the boyfriend to renew his passport, which shows they've tried to address the issue. The fact that they had tiffs suggests there was some conflict, but maybe the boyfriend didn't take it seriously. \n\nNow, the author is deciding to let the boyfriend face the consequences. Is that fair? Well, the boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. However, in a relationship, partners often support each other. The author might have a point in expecting the boyfriend to handle his own responsibilities. On the other hand, the author could have taken a more proactive approach, like helping him apply or even going with the idea that if he doesn't renew it, she won't go. \n\nBut wait, the trip is booked and paid for. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses his share, which is $1000 each. That's a significant amount. The author might be using this as a punishment, but is it justified? If the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing his passport despite being reminded, then he's the one responsible. However, if the author didn't make it clear that the trip depends on both of them being ready, maybe they share some blame. \n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned is a mother-child relationship. The author feels like they have to take care of him. Maybe this is a pattern where the author takes over responsibilities, leading to this situation. By not helping now, the author is asserting themselves, which might be necessary if the boyfriend is juvenile. But is cutting off support after multiple warnings wrong? \n\nConsidering all angles: the boyfriend's responsibility vs. the author's support. The key is whether the author had a duty to ensure the passport was renewed. Since it's his passport, it's his responsibility. However, in a relationship, there's mutual support. The author might be right to let him face the consequences as a lesson, especially if they've tried to help before. Alternatively, maybe the author should have done more to assist, like accompanying him to renew it, but since they didn't, they might be partly at fault. \n\nHmm. The author's decision to go alone if he doesn't act might be seen as harsh, but if he's aware of the consequences and still doesn't act, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The main issue is whether the author had a responsibility to enforce the passport renewal. Since the boyfriend is an adult, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, if the author didn't make it clear that the trip hinged on both of them being ready, maybe they are. But given that they had multiple reminders and tiffs, it's likely the boyfriend is at fault. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
