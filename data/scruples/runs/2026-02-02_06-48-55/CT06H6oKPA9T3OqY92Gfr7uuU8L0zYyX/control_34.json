I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire, leading to him missing their trip. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author mentions bringing it up several times and even having arguments. They booked the trip in November, costing $1000 each. Now, the deadline is near for the passport renewal, and the author plans to not intervene, letting the boyfriend handle it if he can't get it done in time. The author is considering going on the trip alone.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author have responsibility for the passport renewal? The boyfriend is an adult, so maybe the responsibility is his. But the author kept reminding him. How many times did they bring it up? The user says \"several times\" and had tiffs. Maybe they tried to help but he didn't act. \n\nThe cost is $1000 each. If the trip is already paid for, and the boyfriend doesn't get his passport, they might lose the money. But the author is choosing to go alone. Is that fair? Well, the author's intention is to let him face the consequences. But is this abandonment? If the boyfriend is an adult, maybe he's responsible for his own documents. However, the relationship dynamic is mentioned as mother-child, which might suggest an imbalance. The author might be overstepping by not helping, but maybe they've done their part. \n\nAlso, the user is planning not to say anything, which could be seen as passive-aggressive. If the author had communicated clearly earlier and warned the boyfriend, maybe that's different. But since they've already booked the trip, and the deadline is near, the author might be holding them accountable. \n\nBut on the other hand, if they are partners, maybe they should have taken joint responsibility. The author could have helped more, but maybe they tried. The boyfriend's inaction led to the problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that in a relationship, both parties should support each other, so not helping could be seen as abandoning. \n\nBut considering that the boyfriend is an adult and the author has done their part in bringing it up multiple times, the blame might not be on the author. So the answer might be B (No). But maybe some people would think the author should have intervened more. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The key is whether the author is responsible for the boyfriend's inaction. Since the responsibility lies with the individual to get their own passport, the author isn't in the wrong. So B.\n"
