I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport go unaddressed, leading to him missing their trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating over a year, and the boyfriend's passport expired in 2018. The author has mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, paid $1000 each. Now, the deadline is near, and the author is planning to go alone if he doesn't get his passport in time.\n\nThe key points to consider: Who is responsible for the passport? The boyfriend is the one whose passport expired. The author has tried to remind him, but he didn't act. The trip was booked together, but the passport is his responsibility. \n\nIn most cases, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. The author might not be at fault here because she's made an effort to communicate. However, the fact that they paid together and planned the trip as a couple complicates things. But the author isn't the one whose passport is expired. \n\nIs she being unfair by not helping more? Well, she's allowed to set boundaries. If he's an adult, he should be responsible for his own documents. The author isn't forcing him to go; she's choosing to go if he doesn't act. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). She's taking responsibility for her own actions and not enabling his negligence. The boyfriend is accountable for his own passport. The author's choice to proceed without him is her right, especially since she's made her case and given warnings. The financial loss is on both of them, but she's not the one who caused the passport to expire. \n\nI think the correct answer is B.\n"
