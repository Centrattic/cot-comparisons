I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend has had an expired passport since May 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked and paid for a $1000 each trip in November. Now, the deadline is approaching for him to get his passport renewed in time. The author is considering not helping him and just going on the trip alone, letting him face the consequences.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, let's break it down. The boyfriend is an adult. It's his responsibility to renew his passport. The author has tried to bring it up and even had conflicts. She's not forcing him to go; she's just not helping him anymore. But she's also the one who booked the trip. Maybe she could have waited until he had his passport sorted before booking? But they did book it in November, and she had mentioned the issue before. It's possible she thought he would take care of it by then.\n\nHowever, by not helping him now, is she being an asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she's holding him accountable for his own responsibilities. On the other hand, they made a joint decision to book the trip, and she's choosing to go alone, which might be seen as abandoning him. But the boyfriend's inaction over a long period might make her decision understandable. \n\nI think the key points are: the boyfriend is an adult, she's given multiple chances, and she's not forcing him to go. The money is a shared expense, but she's not the one who is at fault for his expired passport. So the answer might be B (no), she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that as a partner, she should have ensured he had his passport sorted, making her an asshole for not stepping in. But given that the responsibility is on him and she's not helping, maybe B is the right choice.\n"
