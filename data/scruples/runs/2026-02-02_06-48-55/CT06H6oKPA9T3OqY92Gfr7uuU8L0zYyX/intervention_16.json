      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's boyfriend has an expired passport since May 2018. The author has mentioned this several times, even had arguments about it. They booked a trip together in November, costing $1000 each. The deadline to send the passport in is approaching soon. The author is considering not saying anything and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences, so she can go on the trip alone. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the boyfriend's passport has been expired for a long time, the author has tried to remind him multiple times, they've had conflicts over it, they paid a significant amount for the trip, and the author is thinking about not helping him and letting him miss the trip. The question is whether she's an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibility of each party. The boyfriend is the one with the expired passport, which is his responsibility to renew. The author kept reminding him, even had arguments. So she tried to get him to take action. Now, the deadline is near, and he hasn't acted. She's considering not helping, which would mean he can't go. But she's wondering if she's in the wrong by not helping him and going alone.\n\nOn one hand, he's responsible for his own passport. She did her part by reminding him. If he didn't take action, it's his fault. She might feel justified in not bailing him out again, especially since they had conflicts. On the other hand, even though it's his responsibility, maybe she has a duty as a partner to help him out, especially since they booked the trip together. The money is an issue too\u2014$1000 each is a lot, and if he can't go, she might lose that money. But she's okay with that because he should have taken care of his passport.\n\nAnother angle: the relationship dynamic. The author mentions feeling like a mother to a child sometimes with him. That might indicate that she's used to taking charge, which could make her decision seem less surprising. But even if he's irresponsible, is it her fault for not stepping in sooner? Maybe she should have been more proactive in helping him renew it, not just reminding. However, the responsibility for a passport is on the individual.\n\nAlso, considering the financial aspect. They both paid for the trip. If she goes without him, he might lose his share, and she hers. But she's okay with that. But is it fair to penalize him by not helping? If he's the one who messed up, then maybe she's right to let him face the consequences. However, relationships sometimes require compromise. If she cancels the trip, maybe they both lose, but if she goes alone, she's still spending the money while he's left out.\n\nBut the author is considering not saying anything, which could be seen as passive-aggressive. Maybe she should have confronted him earlier or made a decision to cancel the trip together if he wasn't going to act. But since she's already decided to go alone, it's more about accountability.\n\nIn terms of morality, is it wrong to enforce responsibility even if it means parting ways? If the boyfriend is an adult and responsible for his own documents, then she's not in the wrong for not helping. However, the fact that they made plans together and she's going without him might be seen as selfish, but if he's the one who failed to act, she's justified.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whose responsibility it is. Since the passport is his to renew, and she tried to help, then she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend is responsible for his own travel documents regardless of the relationship. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
