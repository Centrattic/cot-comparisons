I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The boyfriend has had an expired passport since 2018, and the person mentioned it multiple times. They even got into arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the person is planning to go alone if the boyfriend doesn't get his passport renewed.\n\nFirst, responsibility for the passport: usually, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. The boyfriend should have taken care of renewing his own passport. The author tried to remind him multiple times, which shows they tried to help, but ultimately, the onus is on him. If he didn't act, then he's the one who's responsible for the consequence of missing the trip.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more proactive. Like, maybe they could have reminded him more, or even helped him get the passport renewed. But the key point here is that the author is being honest about the situation and not intentionally hiding the deadline. They're letting him take responsibility for his own inaction. If they had covered for him or didn't mention the deadline, that would be different. Since they've discussed it before and the deadline is now near, the author isn't at fault for not bailing him out this time.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: they both paid for the trip. If the boyfriend can't go because of his own mistake, the author isn't stealing or being unfair by going alone. The cost is already incurred, but if they can't refund it, it's his loss for not getting his passport in time. \n\nThe relationship dynamic mentioned (mother-child) might imply that the boyfriend is used to the author taking care of his responsibilities, but in this case, she's setting a boundary. That could be a positive step in the relationship, encouraging him to take responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The responsibility lies with the boyfriend for not acting on his own passport renewal despite being reminded. The author isn't at fault for not intervening further when he hasn't followed through.\n"
