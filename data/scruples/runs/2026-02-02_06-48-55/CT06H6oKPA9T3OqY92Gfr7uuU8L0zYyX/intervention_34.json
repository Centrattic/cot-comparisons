It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause them to miss a trip. The author's boyfriend hasn't renewed his passport despite being reminded multiple times. The author is considering not helping him anymore and going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. Both partners in a trip are responsible for ensuring necessary documents are in order. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, which is a long time. The author has brought it up several times, even had arguments about it. Now, the deadline is approaching, and the author is thinking of letting him deal with the consequences. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author neglect their responsibility? Or is the boyfriend at fault for not acting on multiple reminders? The author has tried to communicate and even had conflicts, so maybe they've done their part. However, the trip is a joint booking and payment (1000$ each). If the author goes alone, they might lose their money, but that's a consequence of not renewing the passport. \n\nIs it fair to hold the author responsible for not forcing the boyfriend to renew his passport? Probably not. The boyfriend is an adult and responsible for his own documents. The author has made their concerns known. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. However, some might argue that as a partner, they have a duty to ensure both are prepared for the trip. But since the boyfriend repeatedly ignored the issue, the author might feel it's beyond their control. \n\nAnother angle: the author is in a dynamic where they feel like a parent. This could imply that the boyfriend is immature, and the author is trying to take a firm stance. If the author lets things slide, it might reinforce the boyfriend's irresponsible behavior. By deciding to let him face the consequences, the author is trying to teach a lesson. \n\nOn the other hand, the financial loss and the impact on the relationship might be considered. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend might feel abandoned, but the author might feel justified. The question is about whether the author is the asshole. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being the asshole usually involves not taking responsibility or being inconsiderate despite having the means to help. Since the author has already tried multiple times to get the boyfriend to act, they might not be at fault. The boyfriend's own inaction is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
