I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The author's boyfriend has had an expired passport since 2018, and the author has brought it up multiple times. They even had arguments about it. The trip was booked in November, costing $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend deal with the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The author has a responsibility to plan the trip, but the boyfriend's passport was his own responsibility. The author has tried to bring it up multiple times. The key here is whether the author is at fault for not taking further action. \n\nThe boyfriend's passport is his personal document. The author can't renew it for him. The author has communicated the issue, but the boyfriend didn't act. The cost is a factor here too. If the author pays for both, not going with the boyfriend might save the author money, but the boyfriend would lose his share. However, the author is considering letting the boyfriend face the consequences, which could be seen as a lack of support in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, mutual responsibility is important. The author might feel frustrated, but abandoning the trip without a fight could be seen as harsh. However, the boyfriend's negligence is a big part of the problem. The author isn't in control of the passport, so they can't be entirely blamed. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had taken more proactive steps, like helping him renew the passport or setting up reminders, maybe the outcome would be different. But the author did mention bringing it up several times. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for the passport lies with the boyfriend. The author tried to communicate, but the final responsibility is on him. Letting him deal with the consequences might be tough love, but it's not entirely the author's fault.\n"
