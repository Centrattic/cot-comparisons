I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, costing $1000 each. Now the deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and letting the boyfriend face the consequences, so they can go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the repeated reminders, the tiffs, and the significant financial investment. The author has tried to address the issue multiple times, but the boyfriend hasn't acted. The author's plan is to let him handle it, even if it means he can't go. The question is whether that makes the author an asshole.\n\nThe user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the responsibilities in a relationship. While the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, the author has tried to help and nagged him. However, the author is now choosing to let him face the consequences. Is it fair to hold the boyfriend accountable, or is the author being cruel by not helping further? \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing his passport despite being reminded. On the other hand, the author is using the trip as a consequence, which might be seen as a punishment. The financial loss is significant, and the author might be abandoning the trip together. However, the author might be trying to teach responsibility. \n\nBut letting someone miss out on a planned trip due to their own inaction could be seen as harsh. Maybe the author should have intervened more, like helping with the renewal process. But the author might feel it's the boyfriend's responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be showing some accountability by not letting the boyfriend off the hook. However, the act of going on the trip alone while the boyfriend is left out might be seen as selfish, especially since they had planned it together. \n\nI think the answer might be A because the author is choosing to leave the boyfriend in a difficult situation, even though he's at fault. The relationship dynamics, where the author feels like a parent, might contribute to this. Letting him face the consequences is fair, but the emotional impact of missing the trip together could be seen as harsh. However, it's also about personal boundaries. If the boyfriend didn't take responsibility, maybe the author is justified. Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nWait, the user thinks the author is wrong. Let me check the original scenario again. The author has tried to get the passport renewed, but the boyfriend didn't act. The author is now letting him deal with the consequences. Is it the author's responsibility to continue helping? Or is it the boyfriend's? If the author has done their part, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But by not helping anymore, they are allowing the situation to play out. Maybe the answer is B, that the author is not in the wrong because they've done their part and the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport. The author isn't actively sabotaging, just not helping further. So the answer could be B. But maybe the author is in the wrong because they could have helped more. \n\nAlternatively, the author is holding the boyfriend accountable, which is good. But the question is about being an asshole. If the author is punishing the boyfriend by not helping, maybe that's unfair. But if the author is just not helping further when it's the boyfriend's responsibility, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They've tried to get the boyfriend to act, and now it's his responsibility. Letting him face the consequences is holding him accountable. However, the user thinks the author is wrong. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A because the author is being cruel by not helping when they have the means to. But the author might not be obligated to help. It's a tough call. The key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not helping, but the boyfriend is at fault, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. So B.\n"
