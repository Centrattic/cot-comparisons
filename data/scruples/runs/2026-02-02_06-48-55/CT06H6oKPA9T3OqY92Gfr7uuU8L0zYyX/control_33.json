I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's boyfriend's passport expired in 2018. She's mentioned it several times, even had arguments about it. They booked a trip in November, costing $1k each. Now, the deadline to send his passport for renewal is approaching, and the author is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess responsibility. The boyfriend is an adult, so he's responsible for his own passport. The author can remind him, but she's not the one who needs to renew it. However, she brought it up multiple times and they had conflicts over it. So maybe she tried to communicate. \n\nNow, the author is thinking of letting him face the consequences. Is that being an asshole? Well, if she's not at fault for his passport not being renewed, then she's not wrong to let him go. But maybe she's being passive-aggressive instead of addressing it directly. Like, maybe she should have set up a plan or a deadline together. But she did mention it, and he didn't act. \n\nAlso, the cost is significant. If they both paid $1k, she might be out that money if he can't go. But the question is about moral wrongdoing. If she's not helping and he messes it up, is she responsible? Maybe not, because it's his responsibility. However, by not following up more, maybe she's abdicating responsibility. \n\nIn relationships, there's a balance between being supportive and enabling. She tried to push him, but maybe not enough. But if he kept ignoring it, then she's not wrong to take the trip. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, and she's not the one who failed to renew it. She tried to communicate, and if he didn't act, then she's not in the wrong for going on the trip. However, some might argue she should have done more, but given the info, B seems right.\n"
