I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. So, the boyfriend's passport expired back in May 2018, and the user has mentioned it several times. They even had arguments about it. Now they've booked a trip, paid $1000 each, and the deadline for renewing the passport is approaching. The user plans to do nothing and go on the trip alone if he doesn't get it done.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Both people in a relationship share responsibilities, but sometimes one person might be more responsible for a specific task. The passport renewal is something that the boyfriend was supposed to handle. The user has tried multiple times to get him to renew it but he didn't. Now, they're at a point where the user is considering making him take responsibility for his own actions, even if it means going on the trip without him.\n\nBut wait, the trip was a joint booking and paid for by both. If the boyfriend can't go because his passport is expired, the user is still out the money they paid. So, maybe the user is trying to hold him accountable, but it's also a financial hit. However, the user might think that since the boyfriend neglected his responsibility, he should face the consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user could have taken more active steps. Like, if they had a plan in place, maybe they could have tracked the renewal process themselves or set up reminders. But the user says they brought it up several times and even had tiffs. So perhaps the boyfriend wasn't responsive. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong by not helping him, leading to him missing the trip. If the user had forced the issue earlier, maybe they could have ensured the passport was renewed. But the user might be trying to teach him a lesson about responsibility. However, letting someone miss a trip they paid for and planned might be seen as harsh. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should have been more proactive. If the user really wanted to go on the trip together, maybe they should have intervened more. But since the user is choosing not to intervene, they're allowing the boyfriend's inaction to cause the problem. \n\nI think the key here is whether the user had a shared responsibility. If the user was supposed to help manage the passport renewal process, then not helping would be their fault. But if the boyfriend was solely responsible, then maybe the user isn't in the wrong. However, in a relationship, sometimes partners help each other with such tasks, so if the user didn't step in despite knowing the issue was unresolved, they might share some responsibility. \n\nBut the user says they brought it up several times and had tiffs. So they tried to communicate. The boyfriend didn't act, so the user is now letting him face the consequences. In that case, the user isn't in the wrong because they did their part to warn him. The problem is the boyfriend's negligence. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they made the effort to inform him, and now he's responsible for the outcome.\n"
