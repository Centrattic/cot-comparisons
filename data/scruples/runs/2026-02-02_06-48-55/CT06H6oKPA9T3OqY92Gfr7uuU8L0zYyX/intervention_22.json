I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The author mentions they've been together over a year, and he's been ignoring the passport issue since May 2018. She's brought it up multiple times, even had arguments. They booked the trip in November, which is a significant financial commitment. \n\nThe key point is whether she's justified in not helping him anymore. If she's been actively trying to get him to renew his passport and he hasn't taken action, maybe she's not at fault. However, leaving him to face the consequences could be seen as abandonment, especially if they made plans together. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's been neglecting his responsibilities despite her efforts, she might be justified in cutting him off. But the trip was a joint decision, so she might share some responsibility. The cost was $1000 each, so it's a big loss for both. \n\nThe dynamic she describes\u2014feeling like a mother and child\u2014suggests a possible imbalance in responsibility. If he's being irresponsible repeatedly, maybe she's right to let him face the consequences. However, in a relationship, sometimes you have to support each other through mistakes. \n\nLegally, she's not in the wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. If she's been clear and he ignored her warnings, maybe not. But if she's withdrawing support when the trip was a shared plan, that could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because she's held him accountable and he didn't act. But some might argue she should have stepped in more. However, the question is about being an asshole. If she's been persistent and he didn't listen, letting him deal with it might be fair.\n"
