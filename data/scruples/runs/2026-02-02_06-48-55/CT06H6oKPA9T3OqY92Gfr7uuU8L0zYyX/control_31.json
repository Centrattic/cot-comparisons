I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. \n\nFirst, look at the facts. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has tried to bring it up multiple times. They had even argued about it. The trip was booked in November, costing $1000 each. The deadline is approaching, and the author is considering not helping him and just going alone.\n\nNow, the key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend is ultimately responsible for his own passport. Even though the author reminded him, the onus is on him to renew it. However, she might be at fault if she didn't follow up more effectively or if she made promises to help him that she didn't keep. But in this case, she says she's been bringing it up and even had arguments. So she did her part.\n\nThe author's plan is to let him deal with the consequences, which is a valid choice. She's not forcing him to go; he didn't take action despite being warned. She's also not lying to him. She's just not helping further. That seems fair because he's responsible for his own documents. \n\nBut some might argue that she's using this as a lesson or punishing him for his juvenile behavior. However, since the trip is already booked and she's not canceling it, it's more about holding him accountable. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if she's been clear and he didn't act, then she's not the one at fault. The boyfriend's negligence is the main issue here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
