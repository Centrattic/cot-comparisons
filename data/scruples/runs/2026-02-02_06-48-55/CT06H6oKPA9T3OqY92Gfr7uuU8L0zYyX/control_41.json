I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend going on a trip, but the boyfriend's passport expired in 2018. The author has mentioned this several times, even had arguments about it, and then they booked the trip in November. Now the deadline is approaching for renewing the passport so it gets back in time. The author is considering not helping the boyfriend and letting him miss the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should contribute to plans, especially something as important as international travel. The boyfriend's passport being expired since 2018 is a long time, which makes me wonder if he's negligent. But the author also hasn't resolved this despite bringing it up multiple times. \n\nThe author paid for the trip, which costs $1000 each. If they cancel now, there might be financial loss. The author is thinking of going on the trip alone, leaving the boyfriend to deal with the consequences. Is this fair? Well, the author has a right to be upset if the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility. However, in a relationship, supporting each other's travel needs is part of the partnership. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's responsibility is to renew his own passport. The author can't renew it for him. If he didn't act on the reminders, maybe it's his fault. The author did her part by bringing it up. However, in a partnership, maybe the author should have taken a more active role, like paying for the renewal or helping him process it. But the question is about the author's responsibility. \n\nIf the author doesn't help and the boyfriend misses the trip, she's allowing the consequences to happen. But she's not forcing him; the passport is his responsibility. However, she is choosing not to communicate and leave him in the dark. That could be seen as a bit harsh, but if she's already made the decision and he's not acting, maybe she's justified. \n\nConsidering the arguments they had, maybe there's some blame on both sides. The author might be right to be frustrated. But in terms of being an asshole, if she's not helping and the trip is a shared plan, maybe she's somewhat responsible. However, since the passport is his to renew, maybe she's not to blame. \n\nHmm. I think it's a bit of a gray area. The author did her part in reminding him, but not taking further action could mean she's in the wrong because she's letting him face the consequences without support. But if she's been clear and he didn't act, maybe she's not. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the passport is his responsibility, and she's allowed to prioritize her own plans if he doesn't take action. But maybe there's a middle ground where she should have communicated better or offered help. However, the question is whether she's an asshole for not helping now. Since she's already warned him, maybe she's not at fault.\n"
