I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, and she's been reminding him to renew it. They even had arguments about it. Now, with the trip booked and paid for, she's considering letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get his passport renewed in time, so she can go on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility sharing in a relationship. Both partners usually share responsibilities, especially for something important like travel plans. She brought it up multiple times, so maybe she's done her part. But the passport is his, and ultimately, he's responsible for his own documents. However, in a relationship, supporting each other in planning is common. If he's been neglecting it despite her reminders, maybe it's his fault. But she could have stepped in more, like helping him renew it or even handling the renewal herself if he wasn't acting. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's made multiple attempts and he's not listened, then maybe she's not at fault. The cost is $1000 each, so it's a significant investment. Letting him miss out because he didn't act on his responsibilities could be seen as fair. But is it fair to cut him off completely without further intervention? Perhaps she could have given him a final deadline and then followed through if he didn't meet it. \n\nAlso, the dynamic mentioned is like parent and child, which might imply he's been irresponsible. She might be punishing him for his negligence. But is it right to punish him by going without him? It could be seen as harsh, but maybe he deserves it if he's been given multiple chances. \n\nI need to balance personal responsibility vs. relationship support. If the boyfriend was solely responsible and she tried enough to help, then she's not at fault. If she could have done more to assist him, maybe she shares some blame. But given the info, she brought it up several times. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that in a relationship, you help each other avoid such issues. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether she did enough to help him. If she only reminded and he ignored, then maybe she's not wrong. If she could have taken more active steps, maybe she is. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes, she's wrong), that implies she should have done more. If B (no), then she did enough. I'm leaning towards B, but I'm not sure. Maybe the key is that she's letting him face the consequences of his own actions after multiple reminders, so she's not at fault.\n"
