I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire. The key points here are that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, the person has brought it up multiple times, they even had arguments about it, and they paid $1000 each for the trip. The deadline for the passport renewal is approaching, and the author is considering not saying anything and going on the trip alone if the boyfriend doesn't handle it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider responsibility. The person mentions they've tried to get the boyfriend to renew his passport several times and had conflicts. That suggests they've made their concerns known. The boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't take action despite being aware. The author is now choosing not to intervene further, which could lead to the trip being ruined for him. \n\nBut wait, the author paid for the trip, so they might be trying to hold the boyfriend accountable. If the boyfriend wasn't proactive, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, letting someone miss a trip due to their own negligence could be seen as harsh, especially if the author didn't make one final effort to help or warn him. \n\nAlso, the dynamic they mentioned\u2014feeling like a parent to the boyfriend\u2014might imply that the author has taken on a caretaker role. If they've been nagging him and he hasn't listened, maybe the author is justified in stepping back. But is it right to let him face the consequences without support? \n\nOn the other hand, being in a relationship usually involves compromise and support. If the author had one last talk or tried to assist in renewing the passport, even if the boyfriend failed, they might be more absolved. But since they're just going to let it happen, maybe they are being neglectful. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author gave enough opportunity for the boyfriend to act. Since they've already had multiple discussions and tiffs, it's possible the boyfriend is at fault for not taking responsibility. The author might be within their rights to let him face the consequences, especially if they've done all they could. However, some might argue that in a relationship, both partners should support each other through such issues. \n\nBut the author isn't being malicious; they're trying to enforce responsibility. If the boyfriend didn't listen, the author isn't the one who expired the passport. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But others might see it as cruel to abandon the trip. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. The answer could depend on cultural or personal views on accountability in relationships. However, since the author has done their part and the boyfriend didn't act, the author might not be at fault.\n"
