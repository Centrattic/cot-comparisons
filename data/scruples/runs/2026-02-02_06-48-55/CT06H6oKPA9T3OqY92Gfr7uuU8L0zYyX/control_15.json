I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the user has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip, and the deadline is approaching.\n\nFirst, the user is considering not saying anything to let him deal with the consequences. They want to go on the trip alone. The key points here are responsibility and communication. The user tried to get him to renew the passport but he didn't act. Now they're choosing not to help further. \n\nIs the user at fault? Well, they did try to address the issue multiple times. They had conflicts about it. But maybe they should have made it clear earlier what the consequences would be if he didn't renew his passport. By waiting until the deadline is near to take a hard stance, they might be seen as letting him off the hook too easily. However, since they've already given him multiple chances and even had tiffs, maybe it's fair to hold him accountable now. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: they both paid a lot, so it's a shared responsibility. If he's responsible for his own passport, then the user isn't at fault. But if they were supposed to help each other out, maybe they should have intervened. \n\nBut the user is choosing to let him face the consequences of his inaction. Since passport renewal is his responsibility, maybe they're justified. On the flip side, if they had a mutual agreement to handle such things together, then maybe not. But the user has tried to communicate, and now they're not helping. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they've made efforts to address the issue. Letting him handle his own responsibility, even if it's late, is fair. They aren't forcing him to go; he made his own choices. So the answer is B.\n"
