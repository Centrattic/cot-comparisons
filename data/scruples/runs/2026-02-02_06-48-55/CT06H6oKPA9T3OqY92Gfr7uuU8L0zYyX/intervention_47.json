I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the person has brought it up multiple times, even causing arguments. They booked the trip in November, costing $1000 each. Now, the deadline is approaching for sending the passport to get it renewed in time. The author plans to do nothing and let him handle it, even if he misses the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has tried to address the issue repeatedly. The boyfriend's responsibility is to renew his passport, but maybe he's not taking it seriously. The author might feel frustrated and want to hold him accountable. However, the trip is a shared experience and expense. If the passport isn't renewed, the trip is effectively ruined for both, and the author is choosing to go alone, making their boyfriend miss out.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did warn him multiple times and even had arguments. Maybe they should have intervened more, like helping him renew the passport or delaying the trip. But the boyfriend had the final responsibility. The author is choosing to not help anymore, which could be seen as holding him accountable. But then again, the trip is a joint decision, so maybe they should have taken more action earlier. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the author is justified because the boyfriend is at fault, while others might think the author should have taken more proactive steps to ensure the trip happens. \n\nI think the key points are: repeated warnings, shared responsibility, and the financial aspect. If the author left it entirely to him, maybe they're not wrong because the boyfriend knew the consequences. But if the author had the means to help, maybe they should have stepped in. However, the boyfriend's responsibility is his own. The author might be within their rights to not help further, especially after multiple failures. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the responsibility lies with the boyfriend, and the author has tried enough. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the author could have helped more, maybe A. Hmm.\n"
