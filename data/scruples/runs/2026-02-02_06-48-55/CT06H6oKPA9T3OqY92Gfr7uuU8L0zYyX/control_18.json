I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author has mentioned it multiple times, even had arguments about it. They paid $1000 each for the trip in November. The deadline is approaching for sending the passport for renewal. The author is considering not saying anything and going on the trip alone if he doesn't get it done on time.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author has tried to get the boyfriend to renew his passport. He's responsible for his own passport, right? Legally, each person is responsible for their own travel documents. The author can't force him to renew it. But they've had arguments about it. The question is whether it's wrong to let him face the consequences.\n\nThe author is thinking of not helping and letting him deal with it. But maybe they should have reminded him again closer to the deadline? Or perhaps they were too passive before? However, the boyfriend is an adult and should know his own passport's expiration date. The author has already tried multiple times. If he didn't act on his own, is the author responsible?\n\nOn one hand, the author tried. On the other, maybe they could have pushed harder or helped with the renewal process. But if the boyfriend is juvenile, maybe he's being irresponsible. The author's plan is to go alone, which would be a consequence he chose. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility is on him. \n\nBut some might argue that in a relationship, partners support each other. If the author didn't follow up enough, maybe they share some blame. But the boyfriend's own negligence is the main issue here. The author has done their part by bringing it up. So the answer might be B (no), the author isn't in the wrong. They can't force him, and he's an adult. Letting him face the consequences is fair.\n"
