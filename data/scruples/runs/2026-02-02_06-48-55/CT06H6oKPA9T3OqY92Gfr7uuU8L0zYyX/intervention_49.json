I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The situation is that the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now, they paid $1000 each for a trip in March, and the author is considering not helping the boyfriend and letting him deal with the consequences if he doesn't renew it in time.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are communication and responsibility. The author has mentioned the passport issue before, and the boyfriend didn't act on it. The trip was booked in November, so there's been enough time to address this. The author is now planning to leave the boyfriend to handle it himself, which could result in him missing the trip.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, both parties share some responsibility. The boyfriend didn't take the necessary steps despite being reminded. However, the author has a choice here. By not helping or supporting him, they're allowing the situation to play out, even though the problem was the boyfriend's. The author's plan is to go on the trip alone, knowing that the boyfriend might miss out because of his own inaction. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't the one who let the passport expire. The boyfriend is responsible for his own documents. The author tried to communicate and even had conflicts about it. If the boyfriend didn't act, the author isn't obligated to continue reminding him. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own vacation, which is understandable since they paid for it. However, maybe the author should have set a deadline earlier or enforced consequences when the boyfriend didn't comply. But given that they've already booked the trip and the deadline is approaching, the author's decision to let it happen might not be entirely their fault.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that since they're in a relationship, the author should still support the boyfriend even if he's at fault. But the author feels like they've done their part and can't be held responsible for his inaction. The question is whether being passive in this case makes them an asshole. \n\nConsidering all angles, the main responsibility lies with the boyfriend. The author gave him chances and warnings. If he didn't act, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not intervening further. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the question asks if the author is in the wrong. Since the author isn't the one who let the passport expire, but chose not to help after previous attempts, the answer leans towards B.\n"
