I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The person is asking if they're at fault for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's passport has been expired since 2018. The author mentioned they brought it up several times and even had arguments. So they tried to address it. They paid $1000 each for the trip. Now, the author is considering not helping and letting him deal with the consequences.\n\nI need to consider responsibility in relationships. Both partners should share responsibilities, especially when planning travel. But the boyfriend didn't act on the warnings. The author tried to communicate, even had conflicts. If he ignored her and didn't take action, maybe the fault isn't solely on her. But if she knew the deadline was approaching and didn't push him harder, maybe she's partially at fault?\n\nHowever, the main point is that the author is now choosing to not intervene. Since the boyfriend didn't take initiative despite her reminders, maybe it's his responsibility to act. The author tried her part. Letting him face the consequences could be seen as fair because he didn't follow through. But others might say she should have taken more steps to ensure he renewed it. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if she's already made sure he knew the importance and deadlines, then maybe she isn't the one at fault. It's about shared responsibility. If he didn't act, he's responsible. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
