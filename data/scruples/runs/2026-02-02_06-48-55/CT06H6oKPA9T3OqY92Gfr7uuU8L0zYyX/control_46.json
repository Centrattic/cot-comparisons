I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's passport expire. The boyfriend's passport was already expired since May 2018, and the author had mentioned it several times. They even had arguments about it. Now, they've booked a trip that's expensive, and the deadline is approaching.\n\nFirst, the author's responsibility. She brought it up multiple times, so she tried to get him to renew his passport. But ultimately, each person is responsible for their own travel documents, right? So even if she reminded him, it's his duty to take action. \n\nBut wait, since they're in a relationship, maybe there's an expectation that they'd look out for each other. Did she take any active steps beyond reminding him? Like, maybe she could have helped him get the passport renewed, but she just brought it up. If she didn't do anything else, then maybe she's not at fault. However, if she had the means to help and didn't, that's a different story. \n\nThe cost of the trip is $1000 each. If the boyfriend misses the trip, he loses his money. The author is planning to go without him. Is that being cruel? Well, she might feel she's being held back because of his irresponsibility. But on the other hand, maybe she should have taken more action, like helping him apply or not going without him. \n\nAlso, the dynamic she mentions is a mother-child one. If he's acting juvenile, maybe she's trying to avoid taking responsibility again. But letting him face the consequences could be a lesson. However, is it fair to leave him hanging after they both paid for the trip? \n\nI think the key points are: she tried to remind him multiple times, it's his own responsibility, and she's not in the wrong for not forcing herself to stay and wait. But maybe she could have done more. However, in the end, the responsibility is his. So answer B, No.\n"
