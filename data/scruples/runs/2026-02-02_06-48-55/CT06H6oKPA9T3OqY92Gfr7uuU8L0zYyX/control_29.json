It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and despite several reminders and arguments, he hasn't renewed it. They booked a trip in November, and now the deadline is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences, possibly going on the trip alone.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the boyfriend's responsibility. The passport is his legal document, so technically, the responsibility to renew it lies with him. The author has brought it up multiple times, even had arguments, but he didn't act. So maybe he's at fault here. But the author is in a relationship, and they're planning a trip together. The author has invested money, $1000 each, which is a significant amount. \n\nNow, the author's plan is to not mention it anymore and let the boyfriend face the consequences. If the boyfriend doesn't get his passport done, he can't go. The author would go alone. The question is whether that makes the author an asshole. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has tried to communicate and push for it, but it's ultimately the boyfriend's duty. The author might feel that since they've done their part, they shouldn't have to take the blame. However, relationships often involve shared responsibilities. Even though the passport is his, maybe the author could have been more proactive. Like, maybe they should have checked the expiration date themselves or set a reminder. But the boyfriend's been neglecting it for a long time. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: the author is spending $1000 and if the trip is canceled, they lose the money. The author might be trying to protect their investment. But if the boyfriend is at fault, then maybe it's fair for the author not to take the blame. \n\nAnother angle is the dynamic described. The author mentions a mother-child dynamic, which implies that the boyfriend is acting juvenile and the author feels they have to take care of him. That might explain why the author is frustrated and wants to let him face the consequences. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at who is primarily responsible. Since the passport is his, and he didn't act despite reminders, he's probably the one at fault. The author tried but didn't force the issue. So letting him face the consequences might not make the author an asshole. However, some might argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other and maybe the author should have intervened more. \n\nBut given that the author has already done a lot (multiple reminders, arguments), and the boyfriend didn't act, the author's plan is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
