I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend whose passport expired in 2018, and the author is considering not saying anything so he can deal with the consequences of missing their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author has brought up the passport issue multiple times, even had arguments over it. They booked a trip in November, which is a few months ago. The deadline for getting the passport renewed is approaching, and the author is thinking of not helping and letting him miss the trip.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend was fully aware of the problem. He didn't take action despite being reminded several times. The author tried to communicate and even had conflicts about it. The trip is expensive, and both paid for it. If he didn't get the passport renewed, he's responsible for his own part. However, maybe the author should have taken more direct action, like helping him get it done, but he's an adult. \n\nBut the author is thinking of letting him face the consequences. Since he knew and didn't act, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that as a partner, she has a responsibility to ensure both can go. But if he ignored her warnings, perhaps she's justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he was fully informed and chose not to act despite her efforts.\n"
