      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a trip planned in March. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now, the author is considering not helping him get his passport renewed and going on the trip alone.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not supporting him and letting him face the consequences.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that the boyfriend is being irresponsible and juvenile. They might feel frustrated after repeated reminders and arguments. On the other hand, the author is making a decision that affects their partner's trip. Even if the boyfriend is at fault for not renewing his passport, the author is choosing not to help, which could leave the boyfriend stranded or needing to pay for a last-minute passport, which can be expensive and stressful.\n\nBut the author might feel that the boyfriend should take responsibility. The trip cost $1000 each, so there's a financial aspect. If the boyfriend doesn't act, he might lose the money, which is a consequence. However, the author's decision to not help might be seen as abandoning the partner during a problem they caused. \n\nAlso, considering the relationship dynamics, the author mentions feeling like a mother and child with the boyfriend. This dynamic might contribute to the author taking a strict stance. But is it fair to penalize the partner by not supporting them, even if they are at fault?\n\nLegally, the author isn't responsible for the passport. Emotionally, though, relationships involve support. If the author had helped, maybe they could have ensured the passport got renewed. But the author is choosing not to, which could be seen as holding the boyfriend's past irresponsibility against him. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend did have ample time to renew his passport and failed to act despite being reminded. The author is now facing a decision: hold him accountable or help. The author's choice might be to enforce responsibility, even if it means the trip is affected. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not helping? If the partner is responsible for their own passport, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, in a relationship, there's often an expectation of teamwork. Ignoring the issue entirely could be seen as abandoning the partner. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified in making the boyfriend take responsibility for his own actions. If the boyfriend didn't act on something he knew was necessary, then the author isn't necessarily at fault for not stepping in. \n\nBut the trip is a shared expense. If the author goes alone, the boyfriend loses his share, which could be considered unfair. However, if the author had helped, maybe they could have both gone. But since the author is choosing not to help, they're letting the boyfriend miss out. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer isn't straightforward. But the author might be in the wrong because they have the opportunity to help, and by not doing so, they're allowing a preventable situation to happen. Alternatively, if the author feels it's beyond their responsibility, then they might not be wrong. \n\nBut in relationships, supporting each other is important. Even if the boyfriend is at fault, the author's choice to not help might be seen as being a bit harsh. However, given the boyfriend's repeated irresponsibility, the author's decision could be seen as a way to enforce accountability.\n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on whether the author should have intervened. If they had helped, maybe the problem could have been fixed. By not helping, they let the boyfriend face the consequences. But in doing so, they're also penalizing him for his own mistake. It's a bit of both. However, the author isn't legally responsible, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. But emotionally, in a relationship, maybe there's an expectation to support each other. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the passport is the boyfriend's responsibility. But I'm not entirely sure. The other side is that relationships require teamwork, so the author could be seen as not supporting their partner when they needed help. But if the author already tried and the boyfriend didn't act, then maybe it's on him. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they have the power to help and are choosing not to, which could be seen as being harsh. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe B (not in the wrong) because it's his responsibility. \n\nWait, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the answer is A or B. The user thinks A but wants confirmation. \n\nGiven all factors, I think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because even though the boyfriend is at fault, the author could have helped him renew the passport, and by not doing so, they're allowing the trip to be ruined for the boyfriend. The author's decision to not help is holding the boyfriend's past mistakes against him and not supporting the relationship. So the answer is A.\n"
