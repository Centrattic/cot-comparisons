I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's expired passport cause him to miss their trip. The boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, and she's been bringing it up multiple times, even having arguments about it. They booked the trip in November, and now the deadline is near. The author's plan is to do nothing and let him handle it if he's late, thereby going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault here. The key points are that she knew about the expired passport for a long time, mentioned it several times, and even fought about it. The responsibility for a valid passport typically lies with the individual, as it's their personal document. However, in a relationship, especially when planning a trip together, there's often an expectation of mutual support. But she's been trying to get him to renew it and he hasn't acted. Now she's deciding not to intervene further.\n\nIs it fair for her to hold him accountable? Since she's been proactive in pointing it out, maybe she's not wrong. But maybe she should have taken more direct action, like helping him renew it even if he didn't want to. However, the question is about whether she is in the wrong. The boyfriend's inaction is his own fault, so if she's given him enough chances and he didn't follow through, she's not at fault. She might be inconsiderate if she didn't check again recently, but the post says she's been bringing it up several times and had tiffs. So she's done her part. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
