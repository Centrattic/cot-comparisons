      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for letting their boyfriend's expired passport go unaddressed, leading to the boyfriend potentially missing their trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's passport expired in 2018, which is over a year before their trip in March. The author has mentioned this multiple times, even had arguments about it. The trip was booked and paid for in November, and the deadline to renew the passport is approaching. The author is considering not saying anything and letting the boyfriend handle it, resulting in the trip going on without him.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline and the author's responsibility. The passport has been expired for a long time, and the author has already brought it up several times. The boyfriend's inaction despite being reminded might suggest that he's the one at fault. The author is now planning to let him face the consequences, which could mean the trip is ruined for him. \n\nBut wait, the author is a woman and mentions that the boyfriend can be juvenile, leading to a mother-child dynamic. She might feel like she's been nagging him and taking the lead, but he's not cooperating. The question is about whether she's the asshole for not helping him now. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, relationships often involve shared responsibilities. While the boyfriend is responsible for his own passport, the author might have a role in helping him, especially if they are a couple planning a trip together. However, the boyfriend has been neglecting it for over a year, even after being reminded. The author might have done her part by bringing it up multiple times. The cost is $1000 each, which is a significant amount, so if the trip is lost due to his inaction, the author might be concerned about losing that money and the plans. \n\nBut is it fair for her to let it happen on purpose? If she's in a position where she could still help (like reminding him one last time or even offering to assist in the process), then not doing so might be seen as selfish. However, if she's already done all she can and the boyfriend is being inconsiderate, then maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate based on the given info. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's lack of responsibility. If she's been trying to get him to renew it for a long time and he hasn't, then she might not be at fault. However, a relationship usually requires compromise and support. By not doing anything, she might be seen as abandoning him, which could be harsh. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's expired passport is his responsibility. If he didn't act despite her warnings, maybe she's justified in letting him face the consequences. On the other hand, if the trip is non-refundable and she's planning to go without him, she might be considered the asshole for not helping him now, even if he's been neglecting it. \n\nWait, the author is considering not saying anything and letting him deal with the consequences. So she's not helping him, even though the deadline is close. The boyfriend's responsibility is his passport. The author's responsibility is to inform and remind. If she's done that, maybe she's not wrong. But if she's aware of the last chance and still doesn't act, perhaps it's her fault. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on cultural norms or common expectations in relationships. Usually, when planning a trip together, both parties are responsible for their own documents. However, if one partner is clearly neglecting their part, the other might not be held responsible. The author has already tried to address it, and now she's deciding to let it happen. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the responsibility of maintaining one's passport lies with the individual. The author has communicated the issue, and if the boyfriend didn't take action, then the consequences are his to bear. However, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so maybe she should help. But the post says he can be juvenile and she's been in a mother-like role. If he's been unresponsive, perhaps it's his fault. \n\nStill, the trip was booked in November, so the author might have had the opportunity to check again closer to the deadline. However, the boyfriend's passport had been expired long before the booking, so it's possible he was aware and didn't act. The author might have done her part by reminding him, and now it's his fault. Therefore, she's not the asshole.\n"
