It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for letting their boyfriend's passport expire before their trip. The boyfriend's passport has been expired since May 2018, and the author has mentioned it multiple times. They even had arguments about it. Now they've booked a trip, paid $1000 each, and the deadline for renewing the passport is approaching.\n\nThe author's plan is to not say anything and let the boyfriend deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it done in time. They want to go on the trip alone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners share responsibilities, especially when planning a trip. The author has been bringing up the passport issue multiple times, so it's not like they ignored it. The boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't take action despite being reminded. The author even mentions they had tiffs over it. If the boyfriend knew the importance and still didn't act, maybe he's at fault.\n\nBut then, maybe the author should have taken more proactive steps. Like, maybe they should have helped him get the passport renewed, or maybe they should have held back the trip until it was sorted. However, the trip was already booked, so that's a sunk cost. The author is now considering letting the boyfriend face the consequences of his inaction.\n\nIn terms of accountability, if one partner doesn't fulfill their part of the responsibility, the other might feel justified in not going along. The author isn't being malicious; they're letting the boyfriend take responsibility for his own actions. However, some might argue that in a relationship, you support each other, so the author should have pushed harder or not gone without him.\n\nBut the author has already tried multiple times to get the passport renewed. They've had arguments, which shows they tried to resolve it. If the boyfriend didn't act, maybe it's his fault. The author is now choosing to go on the trip as a consequence of his inaction. So in that case, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They're holding the boyfriend accountable. However, it's possible that the author could have found a middle ground, like postponing the trip or handling the passport themselves if necessary.\n\nAnother angle: the cost. They paid $1000 each. If the author goes alone, they lose the money, but maybe they feel it's better to lose money than to be in a relationship where the other person isn't responsible. It's a tough call. But since the author tried repeatedly, maybe they aren't at fault here. The boyfriend is the one who didn't take the necessary steps despite warnings.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They did what they could, and now the consequence is on the boyfriend for not acting. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
