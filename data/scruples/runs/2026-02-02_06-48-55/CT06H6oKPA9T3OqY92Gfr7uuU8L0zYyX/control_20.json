I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user and their boyfriend are planning a trip, but his passport has been expired since 2018. The user has mentioned this multiple times, even had arguments about it, and they paid $1000 each for the trip. Now, the deadline to renew the passport is approaching, and the user is considering not helping and just going on the trip alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship. The user has tried to get the boyfriend to renew his passport, but he hasn't taken action. The user is now thinking of not saying anything and letting the boyfriend face the consequences. The question is whether this makes the user an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is an adult and responsible for his own documents. The user has done their part by bringing it up. If the boyfriend didn't act despite the warnings, maybe the user isn't at fault. On the other hand, they're in a relationship and making plans together. If the user knew the passport was expired and didn't push harder at the last minute, maybe they should share some responsibility. But the user also mentions that the boyfriend is juvenile and the dynamic feels like parent and child, which might explain why the user is frustrated and wants to take a stand.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. They both paid for the trip, so if the boyfriend can't go, the user might lose their money. But maybe the user is trying to hold the boyfriend accountable. However, if the user didn't follow up properly right before the deadline, they might be partly responsible. The user says they're not going to say anything, which could be seen as abandoning the boyfriend. But again, if the boyfriend didn't take action despite prior warnings, the user might be justified in not helping further.\n\nI think the key points are: Did the user do enough to help? They mentioned it multiple times and had fights. The boyfriend didn't act. The user is now not helping at the last minute. In that case, the user isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend didn't take responsibility. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
