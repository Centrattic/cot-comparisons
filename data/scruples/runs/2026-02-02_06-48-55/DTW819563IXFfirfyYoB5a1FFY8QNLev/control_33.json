      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person told their girlfriend they'd get a prenup if they got married. The girlfriend was watching something where someone commented on prenups being unloving or untrusting. The author then said that if he proposed, they'd get a prenup. She got angry and isn't talking to him now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Prenups are a real thing, and people have different views on them. Some see them as practical and responsible, especially if there are assets involved or previous marriages. Others might see them as a sign of distrust. The girlfriend's reaction here is based on the idea that having a prenup implies a lack of trust, which is why she found the comment offensive.\n\nThe author's action was to state that they would get a prenup if they got married. The question is whether this was wrong. It's important to note that having a prenup doesn't necessarily mean a lack of trust. It's more about legal protection and planning for the future. However, communication in relationships is key. If the author brought this up in a way that didn't consider her feelings or perspective, that could be problematic.\n\nThe trigger here was the girlfriend's comment about someone else's relationship. The author responded by bringing up their own stance on prenups. Maybe he should have discussed this earlier, rather than reacting to her comment. If the topic wasn't previously discussed, bringing it up suddenly might have been unexpected and hurtful.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting a prenup. It's a common practice in many marriages. The issue might be more about how and when the topic was introduced. If the girlfriend was already sensitive to the topic because of the show they were watching, then the timing was bad. The author didn't ask if she was okay with it but just stated it as a fact, which could have been dismissive of her feelings.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The author isn't wrong for wanting a prenup, but perhaps he handled the communication poorly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling that the prenup is a sign of distrust, then the author's statement might have been insensitive in that context. But the author's intention was to be honest about their stance. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is considering the other person's feelings. The author could have approached it differently, maybe discussing it in a more private and thoughtful manner rather than in the heat of a conversation about someone else. However, stating a fact about a future plan isn't inherently wrong. It's more about the approach. \n\nBut since the girlfriend is now not talking to him, maybe the author should have been more considerate of her feelings at the time. So perhaps the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), because wanting a prenup isn't wrong, but maybe the way it was communicated was. However, the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the problem is that he didn't consider her feelings when bringing up the topic, then maybe he is in the wrong (A). It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the key is that having a prenup isn't inherently wrong, so the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake was the communication timing and method, not the content. So the answer would be B.\n"
