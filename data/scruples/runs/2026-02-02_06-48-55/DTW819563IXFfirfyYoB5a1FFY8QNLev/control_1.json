      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person told their girlfriend they would get a prenup if they got married. The girlfriend was watching something where someone talked about prenups being unloving and untrusting, and then the person mentioned that they too would get a prenup. The girlfriend got angry and now isn't talking to him. The question is whether the person is at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Prenups are legal agreements that outline the division of assets in case of divorce. They're common in some relationships, especially where there are significant assets, children from previous marriages, or other financial considerations. However, some people view prenups negatively, seeing them as a lack of trust or commitment. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she has a negative view of prenups. The person brought up the topic in response to her comment, which might have been a trigger. By stating they would get a prenup, he might have inadvertently validated her negative perception, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, is the person in the wrong? Well, bringing up a prenup is a significant topic in a relationship. It's possible that the person didn't consider how his statement would affect his girlfriend's feelings. Even if he believes a prenup is practical, the way he introduced the topic could have been insensitive, especially if they hadn't discussed it before. Communication is key in relationships, so maybe he should have approached it more thoughtfully, perhaps in a private, calm setting rather than during a TV show where it might catch her off guard. \n\nOn the other hand, wanting a prenup isn't inherently wrong. Financial planning is important, and discussing it is a responsible step. However, the timing and context might have contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend might feel that the mention of a prenup indicates a lack of trust, even if that's not the intended message. The person might be in the wrong if he didn't consider her feelings beforehand or if he didn't have an open discussion about it. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend's reaction is based on a misunderstanding or if she didn't share her feelings about prenups earlier, maybe some responsibility lies with her as well. But the question is specifically about the person's actions. \n\nSo, balancing these points: the person brought up a sensitive topic in a context that might have been unexpected and potentially hurtful. Even if his intentions were practical, the way he communicated it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Therefore, he might be at fault for not considering her perspective and the emotional impact of his statement.\n"
