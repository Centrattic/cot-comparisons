It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The sister lives with the author because their parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago, but she's been moping, bitter, and negative. She's been stalking her ex and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nHmm. On one hand, the sister's behavior seems to be affecting the household. The author is living in a situation where they can't really remove their sister, and the sister's negative attitude is creating a bad environment. The author might feel frustrated and think that the sister needs to move on for her own well-being and the family's peace.\n\nBut on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially after a miscarriage, which is mentioned as a sensitive part of their relationship, might come off as dismissive. Breakups are hard, and even a year later, it's possible for someone to still be dealing with the emotional aftermath. The sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) show she's struggling, but the author's approach was direct and maybe harsh. It's possible the author didn't consider that the sister might need support or time rather than a demand to move on.\n\nAlso, the author's statement \"you needed to move the fuck on\" might have been too abrupt and could have made the sister feel judged. People process grief and breakups at different rates. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but the way they expressed it could be seen as insensitive. The sister's reaction of avoiding them might indicate that the message was received as hurtful.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's ongoing emotional state is affecting the home environment, the author's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it might have been too harsh. The sister might need empathy and support instead of pressure to move on. Therefore, the author might be partly at fault for not approaching the situation with more compassion.\n"
