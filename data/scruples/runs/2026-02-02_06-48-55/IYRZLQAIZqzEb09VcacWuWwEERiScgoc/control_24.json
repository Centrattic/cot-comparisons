It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been living with the author for about a year since the breakup. She's been moping, negative, and stalking her ex's social media. The author is frustrated and told her to get over it. Now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the breakup (over a year), the sister's ongoing emotional state, and the author's response. The author might feel they're being unreasonable, but the sister's behavior is affecting their living situation. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when they're dealing with grief and loss, can be seen as dismissive. The sister's reaction (avoidance) suggests the comment hurt her feelings.\n\nBut the sister has been avoiding dating and showing bitterness, which might be valid reasons for the author's frustration. The challenge is balancing empathy with the need for a functional living environment. The author might not be in the wrong if the sister's behavior is affecting their quality of life, but the way they approached it could be problematic. However, the situation is complex, and it's hard to say without more context. The answer might hinge on whether the author's approach was respectful enough or if it dismissed the sister's feelings. Given the sister's ongoing pain, the author's comment might be seen as insensitive, making them at least partially at fault. But since the sister's behavior is problematic, the answer could be nuanced. However, in AITA scenarios, the person who confronts but does so without empathy is often seen as at fault. So the answer might lean towards AITA (A). But I need to check if the author's actions were reasonable given the sister's behavior. Alternatively, maybe the author is right to set boundaries but chose the wrong approach. The answer might be AITA because the author didn't consider the sister's emotional state and used harsh language. However, the sister's behavior is also extreme. It's tricky. Maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the sister's behavior is unreasonable, but the way they expressed it was harsh. In AITA, sometimes the person is not at fault if they're dealing with someone else's unreasonableness, even if their approach is rough. So maybe B.\n"
