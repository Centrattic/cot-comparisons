It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the sister is living with the author because the parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister moved in last summer, and since then, she's been moping around after a breakup from over a year ago. The ex-fianc\u00e9 broke up with her right at the start of last year. She hasn't dated anyone since and now says she's done with dating. She's bitter, negative, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset because his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, leading to a rift.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment. The author is stuck living with her because of the parental ownership and lack of formal agreement. The sister's ongoing negativity and bitterness are creating a stressful home atmosphere. The author's frustration is understandable, given the prolonged situation. \n\nHowever, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially one that's been over a year ago but still causing emotional distress, might not be empathetic. The sister is dealing with unresolved issues, including a miscarriage mentioned. The author's approach of directly telling her to move on could come off as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is also dealing with the sister's constant moping and negativity, which impacts their own quality of life. They might feel entitled to express their frustration, especially since the sister hasn't shown progress. However, the method used might be harsh. The key here is whether the author's response was overly critical without offering support or understanding.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. The sister's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author's response might not be the most constructive. So while the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong,\" they could have handled it differently. But the options are binary: A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nConsidering that the sister's behavior is ongoing and the author is in a difficult position, the answer might lean towards B (not wrong), but with a caveat that their approach could be improved. However, the directness of the author's statement could be seen as insensitive. The sister's issues are still fresh in some ways (like the ex's new girlfriend being pregnant), so the author's frustration is valid. Still, the way they expressed it might be the problem. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the sister's behavior is the root issue, and the author has valid reasons to be frustrated. However, the author might benefit from a more empathetic approach. But according to the question, it's whether they are \"in the wrong.\" Since the sister's actions are the main problem, the author is justified in their reaction, even if the delivery was harsh. Hence, answer B.\n"
