It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer lives with their sister because the house is owned by their parents and they can't do anything about it. The sister is still upset about a breakup from last year, hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, and is upset because the ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The writer told her to \"get over it,\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to analyze this.\n\nWell, the sister is clearly dealing with unresolved emotional pain. A breakup, especially a recent one, can take a long time to process. The sister's behavior\u2014moping, being bitter, stalking social media, and still being upset a year later\u2014suggests she's struggling. The writer's approach was to tell her to \"move on\" and \"get over it,\" which might be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSometimes, people in pain need empathy and support rather than advice to just get over it. The writer might not have considered the depth of their sister's emotional state. Even though the writer might be frustrated with the sister's negativity affecting the household, telling someone to get over a breakup isn't helpful. It's possible the sister isn't ready to move on, and the writer's harsh response made things worse. \n\nHowever, the writer is also in a difficult situation, living with someone who is negative and affecting their environment. They might not have had a good way to handle it. But given that the sister's behavior is a result of unresolved grief, the writer's approach was probably not constructive. The right approach might have been to encourage her to seek support or talk through her feelings, not to dismiss them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They should have shown more empathy and understanding instead of telling her to just get over it. The sister's emotional state is valid, and the writer's response was not supportive.\n"
