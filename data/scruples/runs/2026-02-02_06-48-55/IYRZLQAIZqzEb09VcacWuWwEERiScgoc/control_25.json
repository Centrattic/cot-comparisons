It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a year-old breakup. The sister is living with the author, and the situation is causing tension. The sister's ex is with someone else now, and she's been really down about it. The author finally told her to move on.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The sister has been moping for over a year, which is a long time. The author feels stuck because they can't get out of the living arrangement. The sister's behavior is affecting the household negatively. The author's comment was direct and maybe harsh, but is that justified?\n\nEmotionally, it's tough for the sister. A year is a significant time, and if she's still struggling, she might need support rather than criticism. However, the author is also dealing with the stress of living in a toxic environment. The question is whether telling someone to \"get over it\" is dismissive of their feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the author's frustration is understandable. They can't leave and are affected by their sister's behavior. On the other hand, the sister is dealing with grief and loss. The author's approach might have been too abrupt. A more supportive method, like encouraging professional help or suggesting ways to cope, might have been better.\n\nBut did the author cross a line? The sister has been avoiding them since the comment. That suggests the message was harsh. However, the sister's behavior has been ongoing and hurtful. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some cases, pushing someone to move on can be seen as invalidating their pain. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being supportive enough. Alternatively, the author isn't responsible for the sister's emotional state and has a right to ask for a better living environment.\n\nI think the key point is that the author's response was direct and possibly hurtful. The sister might need empathy rather than criticism. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with care. So the answer would be A.\n"
