It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with them in a house owned by their parents. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, bitter, and negative since. She's also salty because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year and is still upset. The author is living in a situation where they can't move out because their parents own the house and it's a rental without a formal agreement. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment negatively.\n\nThe key points are: the sister is stuck in her grief, the author is frustrated and asked her to move on, and now there's tension. The author might feel that the sister is not handling the breakup well and is affecting their life. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially after a year, can be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though the author is in a tough situation, they might have a valid reason for being frustrated, but their approach could be harsh.\n\nBut wait, the sister is still dealing with the aftermath of a breakup, including a miscarriage. The author's sister might be in a prolonged period of grief and adjustment. The author's sister is also dealing with the knowledge that her ex is moving on, which could exacerbate her feelings. The author's response was to tell her to move on, which might not address the underlying issues and could make her feel invalidated.\n\nOn the other hand, living together can create stress. If the sister's behavior is affecting the author's quality of life, they might feel they have a right to set boundaries. However, the way they expressed their frustration might have been unhelpful. The author's approach was direct and possibly harsh, which could have worsened the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister might need support rather than being told to \"get over\" it. The author's frustration is understandable, but their method of addressing it might be counterproductive. The sister's avoidance suggests that the author's words hurt her feelings. So, while the author isn't entirely wrong for feeling frustrated, their approach may have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not handling the situation with more empathy and support.\n"
