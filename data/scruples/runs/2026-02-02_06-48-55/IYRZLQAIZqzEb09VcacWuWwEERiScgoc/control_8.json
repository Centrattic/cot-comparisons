It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is living with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister has been moping around since the breakup, hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to get over it, leading to a rift.\n\nHmm. The key points here are how long ago the breakup was (over a year) and the sister's current behavior. The author might be frustrated with the sister's constant negativity and not moving on. But the sister's reaction to the author's comment was to avoid her. \n\nOn one hand, the author is in a stressful living situation and might be right to want things to improve. But on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup could come off as dismissive, especially if the sister is still dealing with emotional pain. The sister's response of avoiding the author is a sign that the comment hurt her feelings.\n\nThe sister's behavior (stalking ex, bitterness) is problematic, but the author's approach might not be the healthiest. Instead of telling her to move on, maybe offering support or suggesting therapy could be better. However, the author might not have realized the impact of their words. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister had been struggling for a year and the author's comment was harsh, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not being supportive. But if the sister's behavior is toxic and the author is trying to set boundaries, then maybe not. \n\nI think the author's comment was too direct and dismissive. Instead of supporting the sister through her grief, they told her to move on, which could be seen as invalidating her emotions. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
