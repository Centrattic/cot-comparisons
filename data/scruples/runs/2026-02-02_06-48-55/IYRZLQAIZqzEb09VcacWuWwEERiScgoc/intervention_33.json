It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been moping, is bitter, and hasn't moved on. The author confronted her, and now they're avoiding each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago. She's been stuck in this negative state, which affects their shared living space. The author is frustrated and finally told her to move on. The key points here are the duration of the breakup and the sister's ongoing negative behavior.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, dealing with a breakup, especially one involving a miscarriage, can be complex. A year is a long time, but everyone grieves and heals at different rates. The sister's behavior\u2014stalking the ex's social media, being bitter, and negative\u2014suggests she's still struggling. The author's frustration is understandable given the shared living situation and the lack of a formal lease, making it hard to escape the situation.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are affecting the author's living environment, and the author tried to address it. However, the approach might have been harsh. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, even if well-intentioned. It might not acknowledge the sister's ongoing pain and could make her feel unsupported. The sister's avoidance after the confrontation might indicate that the approach wasn't effective or empathetic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified in wanting the sister to stop being negative. They can't leave because of the housing situation. But instead of being confrontational, maybe they should have tried a more supportive approach, like encouraging the sister to seek therapy or counseling, rather than directly telling her to move on.\n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, often the person is in the wrong if they dismiss someone's feelings without understanding. Here, the author's comment might have been too abrupt. The sister needs time and support, not a command to move on. The author might not have considered alternative solutions or shown enough empathy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach was harsh and dismissive, even if their frustration is valid. They could have handled it more compassionately.\n"
