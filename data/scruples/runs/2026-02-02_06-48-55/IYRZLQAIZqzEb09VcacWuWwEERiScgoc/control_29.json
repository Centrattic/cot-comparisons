It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their sister, who's been moping around since a breakup over a year ago. The sister is bitter, negative, and still upset about her ex's new relationship. The author told her to move on, and now their sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author can't leave because the parents own the house and there's no lease. That's a key point. Living together can make such conflicts more intense. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year and is still affected by it. The author's frustration might be understandable because the sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. But how much is the author at fault here?\n\nThe sister's actions\u2014being a \"dark cloud,\" stalking the ex, being bitter\u2014might be causing stress for the author. The author's response was to tell her to get over it. But is that harsh? Well, it's been a year and a half since the breakup, and the sister hasn't moved on. The author might feel they've reached their limit. On the other hand, being told to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, not allowing the sister to process her emotions properly.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is empathy. The author might not have considered the sister's emotional state or the fact that healing takes time. Even though the sister's behavior is negative, the author's approach might have been too abrupt. However, considering the author's living situation and the prolonged negative impact, maybe the author was justified in setting a boundary.\n\nAnother angle: the sister's behavior is affecting the household. The author might have tried to address the issue multiple times without success. The final straw was when the sister found out about the ex's new girlfriend and the pregnancy. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it could have been harsher than necessary. Maybe the author could have approached it with more compassion, offering support instead of just telling the sister to move on.\n\nBut given that the sister is avoiding them now, maybe the author's approach was too direct. However, if the sister hasn't changed despite the author's attempts, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The line between being supportive and being dismissive is thin here. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms, but generally, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be seen as minimizing their feelings. However, in a shared living situation with no escape, the author might not have handled it differently given the circumstances.\n\nSo, weighing all that, the author might not be entirely at fault, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, in terms of the typical AITA responses, the sister's continued negativity and the author's frustration could tip the scales. The author's comment was direct, but they might be justified in wanting the sister to move on. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
