It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister has been living with them, and since the breakup, she's been moping, negative, and fixated on her ex and his new relationship. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior has been going on for a while, and the author is frustrated. The key points are that the breakup was over a year ago, the sister is still very affected, and the author's response was to tell her to \"get over it.\" The sister's reaction is avoidance, which might indicate that the author's approach was harsh or not supportive.\n\nEmotionally, dealing with a breakup, especially one involving a miscarriage, is complex. A year might seem like a long time, but healing can vary. The sister's bitterness and social media stalking suggest unresolved grief. The author's comment might come off as dismissive of her feelings, even if intended to help. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to validate someone's emotions rather than minimizing them. Telling someone to \"get over\" something can be hurtful because it implies that their feelings aren't valid. Instead, offering support or encouraging professional help might be more constructive. \n\nThe living arrangement adds stress, as the author can't easily remove the sister, leading to tension. However, the author's approach might have been too direct without considering the sister's emotional state. The sister's avoidance could be a sign that the author's words were damaging, even if the intention was to help.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their response was dismissive rather than supportive. The answer would be A, as the author is in the wrong.\n"
