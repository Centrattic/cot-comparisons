It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because the parents own the house. The sister's breakup was over a year ago, but she's still moping, negative, stalking her ex and his new girlfriend. The author finally told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to tell their sister to move on. \n\nI know that in these AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent, the nature of the relationship, and the context. The sister's behavior has been ongoing for a year, which is a long time. The author might feel frustrated, especially living together. The sister's actions (stalking, bitterness) could be affecting the household environment. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive, especially if the person is still struggling. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the sister's actions: a year later, still not dating, being negative, and focusing on the ex's new relationship. The author might feel that the sister isn't making progress. However, the author's approach was direct and maybe harsh. The sister's miscarriage during the engagement adds complexity\u2014maybe her healing is longer. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to tell her to move on. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's response might have been too abrupt. Emotional support is usually better than direct confrontation. The sister might need empathy rather than being told to \"get over it.\" \n\nAlso, the author is stuck in the situation, so they might feel cornered. But the sister's actions could be impacting their living environment. However, the author's comment might have crossed a line. \n\nIn AITA discussions, people often consider the time frame. A year is a long time, but it's not unheard of for someone to still be affected. The sister's continued negativity and stalking are issues. However, the author's approach might not have been the best. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the sister's behavior is problematic and the author is trying to set boundaries. But the way it was said could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for not being supportive enough. \n\nI think the community would likely side with the author not being in the wrong because the sister's behavior is excessive and the author is trying to address it. But there's a chance some might say the author should have been more compassionate. However, given the sister's ongoing negative impact, the author's frustration is understandable.\n"
