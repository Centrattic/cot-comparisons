It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is \"in the wrong\" for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with them, which complicates things because there's no formal lease, and the parents own the house. The sister has been moping, being negative, and is still upset about the breakup, even after a year. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment. The sister is described as a \"dark cloud,\" which suggests she's bringing negativity into the home. The breakup was over a year ago, so some might argue that it's been enough time to heal. The sister is still bitter, stalking her ex's social media, and reacting strongly to his new relationship. The author's frustration is understandable given the shared living space and the ongoing negativity.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive. The sister might be struggling with unresolved emotions, and the author's direct approach might not be the most supportive way to handle it. The sister's history of a miscarriage could add to her emotional pain, making it harder for her to move on. The author might not have considered alternative approaches, like offering support or encouraging professional help, instead of bluntly telling her to move on.\n\nThe key factors are the impact on the author's quality of life and the sister's emotional state. While the author has a right to their own feelings and living conditions, their method of addressing the sister's behavior might not be the healthiest. However, the sister's prolonged negativity might justify the author feeling the need to set boundaries. The answer hinges on whether the author's response was appropriately empathetic versus dismissive. \n\nGiven the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they directly told their sister to move on without considering her feelings, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Alternatively, the sister's behavior might justify the author's reaction. The answer is a bit nuanced. In many \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, people are told to approach such situations with more empathy. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively.\n"
