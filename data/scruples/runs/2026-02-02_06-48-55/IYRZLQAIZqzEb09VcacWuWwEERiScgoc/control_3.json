It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because the parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister has been dealing with a breakup over a year ago and has been really negative, moping, and being bitter. The author told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior has been going on for a while\u2014over a year. The breakup was a year ago, and the sister is still very much stuck in that emotional state. She's avoiding dating, stalking the ex, and being salty about the ex's new relationship. The author, living in the same house, is probably dealing with the constant negativity, which can be draining. The sister's actions are affecting the household environment, and the author might feel they can't take it anymore.\n\nBut was telling her to \"get over it\" the right approach? Well, when someone is grieving or dealing with a breakup, telling them to just move on can come off as dismissive. It's true that the sister hasn't moved on, but the author's response might not be the most supportive. Instead of being judgmental, maybe the author could have tried to understand or encourage the sister to seek help. However, the sister's behavior has been prolonged and extreme, which might have worn on the author's patience.\n\nAlso, the living situation is a factor. Since they can't move out, the author is stuck in this environment. The sister's constant negativity is impacting the author's quality of life. The author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might not be the healthiest way to handle it. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, but the situation is tense.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister's behavior is truly affecting the household and the author is at their limit, maybe not entirely. However, the way they expressed their frustration could have been more empathetic. The sister might need support rather than criticism, even if she's being difficult. The author might not be the sole asshole here, but their response could have been more constructive. So, considering all that, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because telling someone to get over a long-term emotional issue can be unsupportive, even if the sister's behavior is problematic.\n"
