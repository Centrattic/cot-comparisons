It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still living with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, she hasn't dated since, and is really bitter. She's been moping, stalking her ex, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is at fault. I need to decide if that's correct. Let's break it down. The sister's behavior has been negative for a long time, and the author is living in a stressful environment because of it. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they can't move out. But the timing of telling her to get over it\u2014when the breakup was over a year ago\u2014might be a key point. How long should someone be expected to grieve? A year seems like a long time, but maybe the sister is still dealing with the miscarriage and the breakup together. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, using \"move the fuck on,\" which could be seen as dismissive. However, the sister's constant negativity might have pushed the author to that point. \n\nIs the author wrong for expressing their frustration? Well, the sister's behavior is affecting the home environment. The author might feel they have a right to ask their sister to stop being so negative. But the way they did it might not be helpful. Maybe the author could have approached it with more empathy. However, the sister has been avoiding the author since, so the confrontation backfired. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction is also a factor. If she's been avoiding the author, maybe she took it personally. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of handling it might not be the right approach. So, is the author at fault? It's a tough call. The answer could hinge on whether the author's approach was too harsh. Since the sister's behavior has been ongoing and the author felt cornered, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But in terms of handling the situation, perhaps the author's tone was inappropriate. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" If the sister's behavior is truly affecting the author's life, then the author might not be wrong for trying to set boundaries. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because the approach was harsh. However, the sister's behavior was long-standing. Hmm.\n"
