It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still affected by the breakup, which caused her to mope around, become bitter, and stalk her ex's social media. The author, living with her because of the housing situation, finally told her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a significant amount of time, but grief and emotional healing can vary from person to person. The author is frustrated because their sister's behavior is affecting their shared living environment. The sister's actions (moping, bitterness, stalking) are clearly problematic, but the author's response was to tell her to \"get over it.\"\n\nNow, the key points here: The sister has been struggling for a long time, and the author's approach was direct and perhaps harsh. While the author has valid concerns about the living situation, telling someone they need to \"get over\" a significant life event can come off as dismissive. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, the author's method might not be the most supportive. The sister is still hurting, and the author's response might not address the root of the problem but instead adds to the sister's stress.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a tough spot, living with someone who is negatively impacting the household. They might not have the authority to make changes, which adds pressure. The question is whether the author's approach was the right one. While the sister's behavior is concerning, the author's directness might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe a more empathetic approach or seeking external help would be better. But the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention might have been to help, but the method was harsh. The sister's ongoing emotional pain isn't something to be taken lightly. So, the author might be partially at fault for not approaching it with more compassion. However, the sister's behavior over an extended period is also a factor. It's possible that the author is not entirely in the wrong, but there's room to argue that their approach could have been more supportive. Given the options, I think the answer leans towards AITA (the author is in the wrong) because they dismissed the sister's feelings in a potentially hurtful way.\n"
