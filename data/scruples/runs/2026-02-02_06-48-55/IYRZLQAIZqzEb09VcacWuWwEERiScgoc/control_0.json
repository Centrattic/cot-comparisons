It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister who hasn't moved on from a breakup over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister lives with the author, and they have no formal lease, so the author can't just ask her to leave. The sister has been moping, being negative, and is still upset about her ex's new relationship. The author finally snapped and told her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nHmm, empathy is important here. The sister is going through a tough time, maybe still grieving the loss and the miscarriage. The author's comment might come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, the author's approach of telling her to \"get over it\" could be hurtful. People process grief differently and at different paces. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because the sister's behavior is affecting their shared living space, but the way they addressed it could be too harsh.\n\nAlso, the sister's actions\u2014stalking social media, being bitter\u2014might be causing tension. The author feels stuck because they can't remove her. But instead of telling her to get over it, maybe a more supportive approach would be better. The key is whether the author's response was appropriate. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's direct criticism without support might be the issue. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't handle it with more empathy.\n"
