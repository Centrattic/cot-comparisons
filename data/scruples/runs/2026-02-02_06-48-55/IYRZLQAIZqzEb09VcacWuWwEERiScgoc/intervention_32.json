It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sister who's been dealing with a breakup over a year ago and is acting negatively, and the author told her to \"get over it.\" The sister is still affected, stalking her ex's social media, and the author is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up a year ago, but she hasn't moved on, is bitter, and the author is frustrated. The author tells her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. Emotional support from family is important. Even if the sister is acting out, cutting her off or being harsh might not be the best approach. The author's tone is confrontational (\"move the fuck on\"), which could be hurtful. Even if the sister isn't moving on, the way the author delivered the message could have been unkind. The author might not have considered the sister's emotional state or provided support instead of criticism. \n\nOn the other hand, living together in a house where one person is negatively affecting the environment is a problem. The author might feel they have to set boundaries. But the key here is the approach. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can minimize their feelings. Maybe the author should have expressed concern and suggested seeking help rather than dismissing her pain. \n\nAlso, the sister's behavior is problematic, but that doesn't mean the author is right in how they handled it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's response was direct and potentially hurtful, even if well-intentioned, they might be partly at fault. So leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) but considering the context. Alternatively, maybe the sister is the one being unreasonable, so the author isn't entirely wrong. But the way it was said matters. The answer might depend on communication styles and empathy. I think the author's approach was harsh, so they are partially in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
