It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still living with the author, which complicates things because they can't really move out. The sister's been acting out, being bitter, and the author snapped and told her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with a breakup for a year, had a miscarriage, and now her ex is with someone new who's pregnant. She's clearly hurt and maybe not processing the situation well. The author, living in the same house, is probably stressed by her sister's negativity and wants her to stop. Telling someone to \"get over\" something, especially when they're dealing with emotional pain and loss, can come off as dismissive. Even if the author is frustrated, their approach might not be supportive.\n\nBut wait, the sister is avoiding the author after the confrontation. The author might have valid reasons for being frustrated living in a house with someone so negative. However, the way they expressed it was harsh. The key points here are empathy and communication. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but their method of addressing it was probably not the best. It's important to validate someone's feelings even if you're tired of hearing about it.\n\nIn situations like this, it's common for people to feel overwhelmed by a loved one's prolonged sadness. But instead of telling someone to \"get over it,\" which can be seen as invalidating their emotions, maybe the author should have suggested seeking support or set boundaries. So, the author's approach was probably unhelpful, but maybe they weren't entirely wrong in feeling the need to address it. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the sister is still dealing with the aftermath of a breakup, miscarriage, and now her ex's new relationship, the author's comment might have been too harsh. So, the answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
