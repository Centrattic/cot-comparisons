It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister is still upset about a breakup from over a year ago. The author lives with her because their parents own the house and it's a rental situation without a formal lease. The sister has been moping, bitter, and negative, and the author finally told her to get over it. Now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and sister live together, which is probably a shared living space. The sister's emotional state has been affecting the household for a long time. The author might feel frustrated because the sister hasn't moved on, and it's impacting their own life. But the sister is dealing with a past breakup, which can be a really hard thing to get over, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage mentioned here.\n\nThe author's approach was to tell the sister to \"get over it\" and \"move on.\" That sounds harsh. When someone is grieving or dealing with a breakup, especially for a long time, telling them to just move on can minimize their feelings. It might come off as dismissive. The sister's behavior\u2014like stalking the ex and being bitter\u2014suggests she's still in a lot of pain. The author's comment could have been a trigger for her to avoid them because they hurt her feelings.\n\nBut then again, the author might have a point if the sister's negativity is affecting the household. They might be trying to set boundaries or encourage healthier coping mechanisms. However, the way the author expressed it seems confrontational. A better approach might have been to express concern, offer support, or encourage professional help rather than directly telling her to get over it.\n\nAlso, the sister's situation is complicated by the miscarriage and the ex moving on with a new partner who's pregnant. That adds layers of pain and jealousy. The author didn't address those feelings, just told her to move on, which isn't helpful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be \"in the wrong\" in the sense that they're also affected by the sister's behavior, but their approach might have been inappropriate. However, from an emotional support perspective, telling someone to just get over it can be hurtful. So there's a balance here between the author's need for a positive living environment and the sister's emotional state.\n\nI think the key here is that the author's method of communication was harsh and dismissive, which is why the sister is avoiding them. Even if the author's intentions were to help or set boundaries, the way it was said was unhelpful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with empathy.\n"
