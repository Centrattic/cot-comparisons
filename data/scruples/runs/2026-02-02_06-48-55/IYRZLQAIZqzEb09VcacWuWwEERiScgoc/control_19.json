It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. Let's break down the context.\n\nFirst, the sister lives with them because the parents own the house and there's no lease, so the author can't really kick her out. The sister has been moping since her fianc\u00e9 broke up last year, hasn't dated anyone, is bitter, and is upset about her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author told her to \"get over it,\" causing the sister to avoid them.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the sister's emotional state and the author's response. The author might feel frustrated living with someone who's been negative for so long. But on the other hand, a year is a significant time to be dealing with a breakup and its aftermath. The sister is dealing with loss, a miscarriage, and ongoing emotional pain. Telling someone to \"get over\" their pain can come off as dismissive, even if the intention is to help. People grieve and process emotions differently, and a year might not be enough time for someone to heal, especially with added stressors like the ex's new relationship.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a tough spot, living with someone who's making the environment unpleasant. Their frustration is understandable. But the way they expressed their frustration might have been harsh. The sister's avoidance suggests that the comment hurt her feelings, which could mean the author wasn't considerate of her emotional state.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, demanding someone to \"get over\" their breakup can be seen as invalidating their feelings. Even if the author's intention was to push the sister to move on, the approach might have been too harsh. The sister might need support rather than pressure. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy.\n\nBut maybe there's a balance. The author has their own life affected by the sister's behavior. Still, the way they confronted the sister could have been more constructive. Perhaps suggesting professional help or other coping strategies instead of just telling her to move on. So considering all that, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they dismissed the sister's feelings without offering support.\n"
