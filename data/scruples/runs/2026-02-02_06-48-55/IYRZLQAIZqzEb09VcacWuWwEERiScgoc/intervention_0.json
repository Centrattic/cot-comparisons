It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is living with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't just ask her to leave. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, but she's still very bitter and negative, especially since her ex has a new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nI think about how long it's been. A year is a significant amount of time, but healing can vary. The sister's behavior\u2014moping, stalking social media, being bitter\u2014might be affecting the household dynamic. The author is frustrated and wants her to move on. But maybe the sister is still dealing with grief and loss, and the author's approach was too harsh. \n\nThe author's response was direct and maybe dismissive. Saying \"get over it\" can come off as insensitive, especially if the sister is still struggling. The sister's miscarriage adds another layer; the breakup might have been tied to that loss. The author might not have considered that the sister's grief is more complex than just a breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is affecting their shared living space. The author's frustration is understandable. But telling someone to \"get over it\" without support or understanding can be harmful. Maybe the author should have approached it differently, like offering support or suggesting therapy instead of just demanding they move on.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not being supportive and for a harsh approach, even if the sister's behavior was problematic. So the answer would be A.\n"
