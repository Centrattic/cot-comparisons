It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. They provided the context where the sister is still moping around the house, being bitter and negative, and the author told her to move on. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she hasn't dated anyone since. She's been stuck in this negative state, affecting the household. The author, living in the same house with no formal lease, feels stuck and frustrated. They finally snapped and told the sister to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's ongoing emotional state versus the author's frustration. Grief and heartbreak can take time, and everyone copes differently. The author might feel overwhelmed living with someone so negative, but confronting someone about their emotions isn't always the best approach. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, especially if the person is still struggling.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's life, and they might have a point about needing to set boundaries. The author's approach was harsh, maybe, but their frustration is understandable. On the other hand, the sister's behavior might be a cry for support or understanding rather than just being stubborn. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intention was to address the situation, but the method was confrontational. The sister might need empathy instead of being told to \"get over it.\" The author's words could have been hurtful and might not encourage healing. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it with more compassion. But the situation is complex, and both sides have valid points. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the sister's grief is valid and the author's approach was dismissive, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
