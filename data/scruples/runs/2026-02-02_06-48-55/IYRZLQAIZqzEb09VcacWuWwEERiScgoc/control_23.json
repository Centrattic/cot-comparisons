It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister not getting over a breakup a year ago, and the author told her to move on. The sister is acting out, being negative, and the author is frustrated. They want to know if the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been with her ex-fianc\u00e9, they had a miscarriage, then a breakup. Now a year later, she's still stuck in the situation, being bitter and stalking her ex. The author, living in the same house with no formal lease, can't really move out. The author's frustration is understandable. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, especially if the person is still grieving a loss. The sister's reaction is avoidance, which might mean she's hurt by the author's comment.\n\nBut then, the sister's behavior is causing a lot of stress in the household. The author is trying to live with someone who's not moving on, which is affecting the living environment. The author's approach might be harsh, but it's from a place of wanting to end the negativity. However, the way they expressed it\u2014telling her to \"get over it\"\u2014might not be the right approach. Maybe the author should have shown more empathy or tried to support their sister in a healthier way. But the sister's behavior is also problematic. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not wrong because the sister's behavior is really affecting their life. They have a right to set boundaries. However, the way they communicated it might not be the best. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the sister is being toxic and the author is trying to handle it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
