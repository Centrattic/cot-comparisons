It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so they can't just leave. The sister's ex broke up with her almost two years ago, and she's been moping since. She's bitter, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the sister has been dealing with this breakup for a long time and hasn't moved on. The author might feel frustrated living with her negativity. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" something can come off as dismissive and insensitive. It's possible the author didn't consider how their words might hurt the sister, especially given the sister's history with a miscarriage. \n\nBut the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment. The author might be justified in wanting her to stop being so negative. However, the approach of telling her to \"move the fuck on\" is harsh. Maybe a better approach would have been to express concern and offer support instead of being dismissive.\n\nIn situations like this, it's important to acknowledge the other person's feelings. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, the author could have handled it more compassionately. So, the author might be at fault for not being empathetic and for using harsh language. But the sister's behavior is also problematic. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's words were hurtful and if they failed to support their sister. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't approach it with empathy. However, others might argue that the sister needs to move on, so the author isn't wrong. Hmm. But in most cases, telling someone to get over something can be seen as invalidating their feelings. So, maybe A is the right answer.\n"
