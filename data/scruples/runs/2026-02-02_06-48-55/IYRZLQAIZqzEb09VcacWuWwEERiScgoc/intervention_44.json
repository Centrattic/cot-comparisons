It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The sister is still dealing with a breakup from over a year ago, and the author is frustrated because she's been moping around and hasn't moved on. The sister hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, and is upset about her ex's new relationship and pregnancy. The author told her to \"move the fuck on\" and now the sister is avoiding them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the emotional aspect here. Breakups can be really tough, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage. Even if it's been a year, grief and emotional pain can linger for a long time. The sister's behavior sounds like she's still in a deep emotional slump, which can be draining for others living with her. The author is in a shared living space, so the sister's negativity is affecting their environment. That's a valid concern.\n\nBut timing is important. A year is a long time, and the sister hasn't moved on. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way they expressed it\u2014telling her to \"get over it\" and \"move the fuck on\"\u2014might come off as dismissive or invalidating. It's possible that the sister still needs support rather than being told to stop being upset. Maybe the author should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding instead of a blunt reprimand.\n\nAlso, the sister is stalking her ex and his new partner, which is a red flag. That's a sign she's not processing her emotions healthily. The author might be concerned about her well-being as well. But even if the sister's behavior is problematic, the response of telling her to get over it could have been unkind. It's a sensitive topic, and people often feel hurt when their pain is minimized.\n\nI should check if there's a cultural context or if the author and sister have a history where such direct communication is common. The question doesn't mention that, so I can't assume. The key issue is whether the author's reaction was appropriate. While the sister's actions are concerning, the author's approach might have been too harsh. It's possible the author could have suggested seeking help or offered support instead of just telling her to move on.\n\nSo the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. They should have been more compassionate and maybe found a way to help their sister process the breakup rather than dismissing her feelings. Even if the sister's behavior is annoying, the way to handle it isn't by belittling her pain.\n"
