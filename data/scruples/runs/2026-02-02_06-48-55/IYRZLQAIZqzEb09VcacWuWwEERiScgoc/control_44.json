It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is living with them, and there's no lease, so the author feels stuck. The sister has been moping, being bitter, stalking her ex, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nHmm. First, the key points here are the timeline\u2014over a year since the breakup. Usually, people expect someone to process grief and move on, but there's no set time for that. However, the sister's behavior seems extreme: constant negativity, stalking, and bitterness even after a year. The author's frustration makes sense because living with someone like that can be really hard, especially when there's no way to leave the situation.\n\nBut the author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it\" flat out, which might come off as dismissive. It's possible that the sister is still grieving and the author's comment was too harsh. On the other hand, the sister hasn't made any effort to improve her situation or manage her negative behavior, which affects the whole household.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to confront her. Maybe they should have approached it more gently, offering support instead of telling her to just move on. But given the sister's prolonged negative impact, the author isn't entirely wrong to express frustration. It's a tricky balance between empathy and setting boundaries. The answer probably depends on how the sister received the message and whether the author could have handled it better. However, the sister's behavior being a year-long issue might make the author's outburst understandable, even if the delivery was harsh. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's nuance here.\n"
