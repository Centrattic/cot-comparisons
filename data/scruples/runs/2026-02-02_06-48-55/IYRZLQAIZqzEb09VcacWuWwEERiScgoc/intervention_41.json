It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original story is wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still upset, bitter, and acting negatively, which affects their shared living situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, stalking social media, and is very negative. The author is frustrated and told her to move on. Now the sister is avoiding them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nHmm, the key factors here are the sister's mental health and the author's approach. Even though the sister's behavior is negative, telling someone to \"get over\" something quickly might not be helpful. Breakups can have lasting emotional impacts, and the sister might still be grieving. The author's frustration is understandable due to the living situation, but how they addressed it could be insensitive.\n\nThe sister mentioned a miscarriage during the relationship, which adds to the emotional complexity. The author's direct approach might invalidate her feelings. Instead of being dismissive, offering support or encouraging professional help might have been better. However, the sister's refusal to date and her bitterness might make the living environment difficult, so the author's intention to push for moving on isn't entirely without merit. But the method used could be harmful.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's approach was probably not the best. They might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
