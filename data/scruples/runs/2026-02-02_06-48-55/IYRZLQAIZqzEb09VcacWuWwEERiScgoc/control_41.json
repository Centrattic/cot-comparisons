It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister is still really upset about a breakup from over a year ago. The author is living with her because of family housing arrangements, and the sister is being really negative, bitter, and stalking her ex. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's mental health. Grieving a breakup, especially one that involved a miscarriage, can be really tough. People deal with grief differently and for different lengths of time. The sister might still be in a painful place, and the author's comment could come off as dismissive. Even though a year has passed, that doesn't necessarily mean she's fully healed, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is living with her and might be feeling the impact of her sister's negativity. The house is a shared space, so constant bitterness and moodiness can affect everyone's quality of life. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it\u2014telling her to \"get over it\" and using harsh language like \"move the fuck on\"\u2014might not be the best approach. It could make the sister feel invalidated, which isn't helpful for someone who's already struggling.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Maybe it's not a clear-cut case. The author's intention was probably to encourage their sister to move forward, but their method might have been too harsh. A better approach might be to listen more, offer support, or suggest professional help if needed. However, the sister's behavior has been ongoing and affecting their living situation, so the author isn't entirely without fault in that context.\n\nBut the core issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. Telling someone to \"get over\" something painful can be seen as minimizing their feelings. Even if the author is frustrated, that doesn't excuse being dismissive. Emotional support is important, and the author's comment might have been more hurtful than helpful. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's approach was probably not the best, so they might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
