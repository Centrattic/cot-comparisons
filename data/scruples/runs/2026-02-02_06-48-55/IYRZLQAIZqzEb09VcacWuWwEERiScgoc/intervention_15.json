It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister is still upset about a breakup over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The sister is bitter, mopes around, stalks her ex's social media, and the author is frustrated, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is living with the author, and they can't move out because of the parents' ownership. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's home environment negatively. The author's outburst was telling her to \"get over it,\" which caused the sister to avoid them.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is dealing with a long-term emotional issue, which is valid. Grief and heartbreak can linger, and it's possible she's still processing it. Stalking ex's social media and being bitter might be signs of unresolved issues or depression. The author might not realize the depth of her sister's pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult situation where they have to live with someone whose negativity is affecting their daily life. They might feel that they've been patient and that the sister isn't taking responsibility for her emotional state. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they've tried to support the sister but feel ignored.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to confront the sister. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the way the author addressed it was harsh. Telling someone to \"get over\" a significant life event, especially one as impactful as a breakup and a miscarriage, can come off as dismissive. It might invalidate the sister's feelings and make her feel unsupported, which could explain why she's avoiding the author now.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key points are whether the action was justified given the context. The author's intention was to help the sister move on, but the method was abrasive. The sister's behavior is indeed troubling, but the author's response could have been more constructive. Maybe they should have encouraged professional help or sought to understand better before snapping.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is partially at fault for how they expressed their frustration. However, the sister's behavior is also a contributing factor. But in terms of who is in the wrong, the author's approach was inappropriate, so they are in the wrong to some extent. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
