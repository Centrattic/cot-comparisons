It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister has been moping, is bitter, and fixated on her ex and his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is still dealing with the aftermath of a breakup, which happened over a year ago. She's not dating anyone, is negative, and is fixated on her ex. The author feels frustrated and decides to confront her, telling her to move on. The sister's reaction is to avoid the author.\n\nFrom an emotional perspective, the sister is clearly still hurt. Grieving the end of a relationship, especially one that involved a miscarriage, is a significant emotional process. The author might be dealing with the stress of living in a shared space and feeling overwhelmed by their sister's constant negativity. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive of their feelings. It's possible that the author didn't validate the sister's emotions, which might have caused the sister to withdraw.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. The author is in a difficult position, living with a family member they can't remove easily. The author's approach was direct and perhaps harsh, but their frustration is understandable given the ongoing situation.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's unresolved grief and the author's attempt to address it in a way that might not be supportive. Emotional support during grief is important, and telling someone to \"get over it\" can be seen as invalidating their feelings. The author might not have considered alternative ways to support their sister, such as encouraging professional help or opening a dialogue without judgment.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's approach was probably too blunt and dismissive. They might have intended to help, but the way they expressed it caused the sister to avoid them. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't approach the situation with empathy and understanding.\n"
