It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been living with them, and the breakup was last year. The sister's ex is now with someone else and pregnant, which is making the sister bitter and negative. The author told her to move on and now she's avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup was over a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. However, the sister is still dealing with it, which might indicate that she's struggling with unresolved emotions. The author might feel frustrated living with someone who is consistently negative and not moving on. But is it the author's place to tell their sister to get over it?\n\nEmotionally, when someone is grieving a relationship, especially after a breakup and a miscarriage, it's a complex process. The sister's reaction could be a mix of sadness, anger, and maybe even guilt or trauma. Stalking the ex's social media suggests she's not moving on, but that's her coping mechanism. The author might feel that her behavior is affecting their living environment negatively, leading them to take a direct approach.\n\nBut is that approach appropriate? Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive. It might invalidate her feelings, making her feel unsupported. Even though the author is living in the same house and dealing with the consequences of her sister's mood, directly telling her to move on might not address the underlying issues. It might also create resentment, as seen by the sister avoiding them now.\n\nThere's also the aspect of boundaries. Since they live together without a formal agreement, they might not have clear boundaries. The author might not have the authority to dictate how their sister should handle her emotions, especially since they're not the cause of the breakup. However, the living situation complicates things because the author is affected by her sister's behavior.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have approached it with more empathy, acknowledging her sister's pain while also expressing their own need for a positive living environment. Instead of telling her to \"get over it,\" suggesting seeking support or engaging in activities to take her mind off it might be better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their direct statement.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intent might have been to help, but the method was harsh. The sister's continued grief might not be something she can control on her own, and the author's response could be seen as insensitive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). However, some might argue that the author had a right to ask their sister to stop being toxic, especially if it's affecting their home life. But given that the breakup is over a year old and the sister's behavior is still problematic, the author's frustration is understandable, but their approach was perhaps too direct without considering her emotional state.\n"
