It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still really upset, moping around, and being negative. The author feels stuck because they live in a house owned by their parents, so they can't move out. The sister's ex broke up with her last year, and she's been bitter, stalking his social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, leading to tension.\n\nHmm. The author's main point is that they're frustrated with their sister's ongoing negativity and avoidance of the situation. The sister's behavior is affecting their shared living environment. But is the author right to tell her to get over it?\n\nWell, dealing with a breakup, especially one that involved a miscarriage, can take time. A year isn't always enough for someone to \"get over it,\" especially if there's unresolved pain. The sister might still be grieving. The author's frustration is understandable, but telling someone to move on can come off as dismissive. It might invalidate her feelings and make her feel unsupported. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests that the comment hurt her.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a difficult situation, living with someone who's creating a negative atmosphere. They might not have the resources or ability to leave. It's a tough balance between being empathetic and maintaining their own well-being.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's important to approach with empathy, maybe encouraging professional help if needed. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be unhelpful and might push them further into isolation. The sister might need support rather than criticism. But the author is also dealing with the stress of living in a toxic environment. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the author's approach here might be too harsh.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because they dismissed their sister's feelings without understanding the depth of her pain. It's possible they didn't consider that she might need more time and support rather than being told to move on.\n"
