It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because it's their parents' house without a lease. The sister has been moping since the breakup, hasn't dated anyone since, and now is upset because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timeline of the breakup (over a year ago), the sister's current emotional state (bitter, negative, stalking ex), and the author's response. The sister is still dealing with the aftermath, including the ex moving on, which is triggering her. The author, frustrated by the sister's prolonged negativity, confronts her, leading to tension.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Well, it's been a year, but the sister is still deeply affected. The author might feel that she's not moving on, but it's not that simple. Grieving and processing a breakup can take a long time, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage. The sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) indicates she's still in a difficult place emotionally. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive and invalidating, even if the author's intention was to help. The sister might feel her feelings aren't being acknowledged, which can be hurtful. Also, they live together, so the author's frustration is understandable given the shared living space. But is it the sister's fault? Well, she's dealing with her emotions, but maybe she could have tried to be less toxic. However, the author's approach might not be the best. Instead of telling her to move on, maybe they should have suggested seeking support or offered to listen. The sister might need more time and space to process, and the author's direct approach might have been too harsh, especially without understanding the depth of her pain. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it sensitively, but maybe there's a middle ground. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the sister's behavior is indeed overly negative for that long. But generally, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can be seen as insensitive. The sister might not be ready, and the author's frustration is valid, but their method of addressing it isn't. The right approach would be to express concern and offer support rather than demanding to move on. So, I think the author is partially in the wrong, but since the options are A or B, probably A is the correct answer because their response was dismissive and could have been handled better.\n"
