It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still moping, bitter, negative, and obsessing over her ex's new relationship. The author feels stuck living with her and finally told her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for a year, but she's still stuck in a negative state. The author is frustrated and wants things to improve at home. But is it wrong to tell someone to get over something?\n\nWell, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment. The author is dealing with a sibling who's not moving on, which is causing stress. The key points here are the length of time the sister has been struggling and the author's intervention. A year is a long time, so the author might feel that the sister should have processed her feelings by now. However, grief and emotional healing vary from person to person. What's considered a normal time for one person might not be for another.\n\nThe author's approach was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could come off as dismissive. The sister might feel that her pain isn't being acknowledged. Even though the author is in a difficult situation, their response might not have been the most supportive. Maybe the sister isn't ready to move on yet, or she might need more support rather than being told to just get over it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also under stress living with someone who's negative and toxic. The sister's behavior is impacting the author's quality of life. The author might not have the tools to handle the situation, leading to an outburst. \n\nI think the main issue is the approach. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be invalidating. Even if the author's intention was good, the method might have been wrong. The author isn't in the wrong entirely because the situation is tough, but they could have handled it differently. However, the sister's behavior is also a factor. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are problematic, but the author's response might have been too harsh. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Wait, but sometimes people need to be confronted. The author might have a right to ask their sister to improve her behavior, but the way they said it could be the problem. So it's a mix. \n\nAlternatively, considering the sister's long-term behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. But the sister's mental health and processing time are important. The author's comment could be seen as insensitive. Maybe AITA is a nuanced question here. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because even though the sister's behavior is bad, the author's approach was dismissive and didn't consider the sister's healing process. They should have tried to support her rather than tell her to move on, which might not be feasible yet.\n"
