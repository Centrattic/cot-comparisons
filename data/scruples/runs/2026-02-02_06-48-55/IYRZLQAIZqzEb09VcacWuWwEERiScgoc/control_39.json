It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister being stuck living with her sibling because their parents own the house. The sister is still upset about a breakup from over a year ago and has been negative and bitter, especially since her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to \"move the fuck on\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The author lives with her and might be feeling the emotional burden of her negativity. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when it's been over a year, can be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though the sister hasn't moved on, the author's approach might be too harsh. People grieve differently and at different paces. The sister's behavior, like stalking the ex and being bitter, suggests she's still struggling, so the author's response might not be helpful. On the other hand, the author is also trying to cope with living in a negative environment. But generally, advising someone to \"move on\" can come off as insensitive, even if the author is frustrated. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it with more empathy. But maybe there's nuance if the sister is being unreasonable. However, the key here is the approach the author took. Even if the sister isn't moving on, the way the author told her could be seen as dismissive. So probably A.\n"
