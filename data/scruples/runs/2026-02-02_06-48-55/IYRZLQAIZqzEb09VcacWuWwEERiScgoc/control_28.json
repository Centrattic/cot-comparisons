It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister who's been moping since a breakup over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The sister is still bitter, stalking the ex, and the author can't move out because of their parents' house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is affecting the household. The author is living in the same house with no formal lease, so they can't just leave. The sister's constant negativity and bitterness might be creating a hostile environment. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they're living in that space every day. \n\nBut then, the sister is dealing with a long-term breakup, a miscarriage, and now her ex is moving on. The author's approach was pretty harsh\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\" might come off as dismissive. Even if the sister is acting out, the way the author confronted her could have been more empathetic. However, the sister has been avoiding the author since, which suggests that the situation is worse now. \n\nI should think about what the right approach would be. Maybe the author should have expressed concern in a more supportive way, rather than being direct and harsh. But the sister hasn't shown any progress over a year. There's a balance between being supportive and enabling negative behavior. The author might be right that the sister needs to move on, but the method could have been better. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's emotional state is valid. The author's comment was harsh, but maybe they were just frustrated. It's a tough situation. On one hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting the sister to stop being negative. On the other, the approach could have been more compassionate. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they didn't approach the sister with empathy. The sister needs support, not a harsh command to move on. But then again, the sister's behavior is affecting the household. The author's frustration is justified, but the way they expressed it was not helpful. So, I think the correct answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more kindness and understanding.\n"
