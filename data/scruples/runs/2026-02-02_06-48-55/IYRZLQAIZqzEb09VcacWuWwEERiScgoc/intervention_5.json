It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still living with the author, and the author feels stuck because their parents own the house. The sister has been moping since the breakup, is bitter, stalks her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The author is frustrated because her behavior is affecting the household environment. The author's comment was direct and possibly harsh (\"get over it\" and \"move the fuck on\"). But is that the wrong approach?\n\nGrief and healing are personal processes. Even if a year has passed, it's possible the sister is still struggling. The author might be feeling the impact of her negative behavior in their shared living space. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can be dismissive of their feelings. It might minimize the sister's pain and not offer support. The author didn't mention trying other approaches, like offering emotional support, suggesting therapy, or discussing healthier coping mechanisms before giving a direct order.\n\nAlso, the sister's actions, like stalking her ex and being bitter, are not ideal, but they're a reaction to her grief. The author's frustration is understandable, but the response might have been too harsh. The sister might need empathy and guidance rather than a blunt demand to move on. The fact that the author is stuck in the situation adds to their stress, but that doesn't excuse a potentially hurtful comment.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the entire household. The author has a right to feel that their living environment is being impacted negatively. However, the way the author addressed the issue could be seen as lacking compassion. Maybe the author should have approached it with more empathy and offered help instead of just telling her to get over it.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's approach might have been too harsh. The author could have handled it better by showing more support and understanding. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their tone and approach, even if the sister's actions are also an issue. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
