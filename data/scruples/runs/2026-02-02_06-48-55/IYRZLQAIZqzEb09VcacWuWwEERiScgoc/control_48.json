It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the person's sister moved in with them over a year ago after a breakup. The sister is still really upset, mopes around, stalks her ex on social media, and is bitter. The writer told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them. The question is whether the writer is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is dealing with a breakup over a year ago. The writer is living with her and has no control over the situation since it's their parents' house. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment\u2014being a \"dark cloud,\" negative, and stalking her ex. The writer's frustration led them to confront the sister directly, telling her to move on. \n\nOn one hand, the sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year, which is a significant amount of time. The writer's comment might be seen as dismissive, especially if the sister is still grieving or struggling. However, the sister's behavior is impacting the writer's living situation. The writer might feel that the sister isn't processing her emotions in a healthy way and is affecting the household negatively.\n\nBut emotional support is important. The sister might need time and space to heal, and the writer's direct approach could have been hurtful. Even if the sister's behavior is problematic, telling her to \"get over it\" might not be the right approach. It's possible that the writer's frustration led them to say something unkind, which is why the sister is avoiding them now.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer is also in a difficult position. They can't leave because the house is rented by their parents, so they have to live with the sister. The sister's constant negativity is affecting their quality of life, so the writer might feel justified in expressing their frustration. However, the way they expressed it was harsh, which could be the issue here.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the writer could have suggested seeking professional help or set boundaries instead of confronting the sister directly in a harsh manner. But the question is whether the writer is in the wrong, not what they could have done differently.\n\nIn terms of social norms, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup after a year might be seen as invalidating their feelings. People grieve differently, and a year might not be enough time for some. The writer's comment could come off as dismissive, even if the sister's behavior is problematic.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the writer's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of the sister's emotional state, even if their intention was to end the negative behavior. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because the writer's situation is also frustrating. However, the key here is the method of addressing the issue. Insulting or telling someone to \"move on\" isn't typically an effective or kind approach. So leaning towards A.\n"
