It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago is justified.\n\nFirst, the sister is living with the author in a house owned by their parents. There's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping around, bitter, and negative. She's been stalking the ex's social media, which shows she hasn't moved on. The author finally tells her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the sister hasn't moved on after a year, and the sister's behavior is affecting their shared living environment. The sister's behavior is described as a \"dark cloud,\" which suggests it's making the author's life unpleasant. But the sister has a miscarriage history and is now reacting to her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant, which adds emotional complexity.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified in asking their sister to stop being negative, especially since it's affecting their home life. They might not want to live in a toxic environment. On the other hand, the sister is still grieving a breakup and a miscarriage, which are significant events. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive of their feelings, even if the author is frustrated.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response was to tell her to \"move the fuck on,\" which is harsh. The sister's avoidance suggests that the author's words hurt her feelings. The author didn't offer support or understanding, just a demand to get over it. That could be seen as dismissive and unkind, regardless of the sister's behavior.\n\nSo, while the author might feel wronged by the sister's negativity, their approach might not be the healthiest way to handle it. It's possible they could have approached it with more empathy, offering support instead of criticism. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing empathy and for being overly critical.\n"
