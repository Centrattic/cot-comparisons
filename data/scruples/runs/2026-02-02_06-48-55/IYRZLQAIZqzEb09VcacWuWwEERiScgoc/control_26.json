It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister to move on from a year-old breakup is in the wrong. The sister has been living with them since last summer, and the author feels stuck because the house is owned by their parents. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been moping, being bitter, and stalking her ex's new relationship. The author finally told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the timing of the breakup (over a year ago), the sister's behavior (moping, bitterness, stalking, negative), and the author's reaction. The author might feel frustrated because their sister hasn't moved on, especially since the breakup is a year old. However, dealing with grief or heartbreak varies from person to person. A year might not be enough time for some people to heal, and the sister's actions (like stalking) could indicate unresolved issues.\n\nThe author's advice to \"get over it\" might come across as dismissive. Saying someone needs to move on can invalidate their feelings, making them feel unsupported. The sister's behavior suggests she's still struggling, so the author's approach might have been too harsh. Even though the author is in a difficult living situation, their response might have been lacking empathy. The sister's avoidance is a natural reaction to feeling criticized or not understood.\n\nConsidering the context, the author might not be entirely wrong in feeling frustrated, but their approach could be counterproductive. The sister might need support or therapy rather than being told to just get over it. The author's responsibility here is to manage their own living situation while being considerate of their sister's emotional state. So, the answer leans towards AITA being on the author's side because their response was likely insensitive, even if their intention was to help.\n"
