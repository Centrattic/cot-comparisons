It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still living with them, which is causing tension. The sister is clearly struggling, moping, being bitter, and is fixated on her ex and his new girlfriend. The author, frustrated, told her to move on. The sister is now avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been through a breakup that included a miscarriage, which is a significant emotional event. Grieving and moving on can take time, especially with such a loss. The author might be feeling helpless or overwhelmed living in the same house with someone so negative. But their approach was to tell the sister to \"get over it,\" which can come off as dismissive or invalidating. \n\nEven though the breakup was a year ago, healing isn't linear. People process grief differently. The sister's behavior\u2014stalking ex's social media, being bitter\u2014suggests she hasn't found closure. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it might have been hurtful. Telling someone to \"get over\" a past trauma can be seen as minimizing their pain. \n\nThe sister's avoidance now indicates that the author's words had a negative impact. It's possible the author didn't consider the emotional state of their sister and instead opted for a direct, maybe harsh approach. The situation might have needed empathy and support rather than a blunt demand to move on. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also in a tough spot, living with someone who's bringing negativity into the household. They might not have had the best way to handle it. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key point is whether the author's actions were appropriate. While their intention might have been to push the sister towards healing, their method was likely inappropriate. The sister's ongoing pain needs compassion, not criticism. So the author might be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more understanding.\n"
