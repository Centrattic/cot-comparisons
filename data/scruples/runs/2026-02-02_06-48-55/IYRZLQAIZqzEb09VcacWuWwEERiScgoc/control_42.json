It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author lives with their sister, and there's no formal lease, so they can't move out. The sister is still upset about a breakup from over a year ago. The author told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them. The sister is described as being in a dark mood, stalking her ex, and being bitter. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is affecting their living environment. The author is probably frustrated because the sister's negativity is impacting their home life. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially one that's been over a year, might come off as dismissive. Even if the breakup is old, the sister is still dealing with emotional pain, maybe even complicated by a miscarriage. The author might not have considered the depth of her feelings or the fact that healing isn't linear.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is unhealthy and affecting the household. The author might feel they have a right to ask her to stop moping, especially since they can't leave. But the way it was said\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as harsh. The sister might feel invalidated, leading to her avoiding the author.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might not be supportive. The sister's emotional state is real, and the author's response might not acknowledge that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the way they handled it. It's possible that the author didn't have a malicious intent but expressed it poorly. The sister's avoidance is a reaction to being criticized. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle the situation with empathy. Even if the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's approach was dismissive. However, there's nuance. But given the question's options, the answer is A.\n"
