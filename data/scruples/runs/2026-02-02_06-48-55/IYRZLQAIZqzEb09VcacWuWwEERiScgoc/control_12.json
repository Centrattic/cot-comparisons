It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The sister has been moping for over a year after a breakup, and the author told her to get over it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is living with the author in a house owned by their parents with no lease, so the author can't just ask her to leave. The sister's behavior has been negative, and the author is frustrated.\n\nBut the key point here is the sister's mental health. She hasn't dated anyone since, is bitter, stalks her ex, and is reacting strongly to his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author confronts her, telling her to move on. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive, especially if they're still struggling. Even though the breakup was over a year ago, healing times vary. The sister has a history of a miscarriage, which might add to her emotional pain. The author's approach might have been too harsh, not addressing support or understanding. \n\nHowever, the author is in a stressful living situation. They might be feeling overwhelmed by the sister's negativity. The problem is that telling someone to just move on without empathy can worsen their feelings. The right approach might have been to encourage her to seek support rather than dismiss her feelings. So the answer might lean towards AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong because of the harsh response without support.\n"
