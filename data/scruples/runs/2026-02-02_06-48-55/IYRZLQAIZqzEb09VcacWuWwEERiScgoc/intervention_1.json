It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister not getting over a breakup that happened over a year ago, and the author telling her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is living with the author, and they can't move out because the parents own the house. The sister is described as moping, negative, and bitter, which is affecting the author's living environment. The author finally told her to get over the breakup, leading to the sister avoiding them now.\n\nI should think about the reasons behind the author's actions. The sister's behavior has been ongoing for over a year, which might be excessive. The author might feel frustrated living with someone who's so negative all the time. However, the sister is dealing with a significant emotional issue\u2014her ex is moving on, and she's struggling with that. The author's approach was to tell her to get over it, which might come off as dismissive or uncaring.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior has been affecting the author's quality of life. Maybe the author tried to handle it in the only way they could, especially if previous attempts to support her didn't work. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to balance empathy for both sides. The sister is dealing with grief and loss, which can take time. The author is trying to maintain their own mental health and living situation. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" isn't helpful. It might be better to offer support rather than dismiss their feelings. \n\nThe author might have valid reasons for being frustrated, but the way they addressed it could be the issue. Maybe they should have encouraged the sister to seek professional help or set boundaries without being confrontational. But since the sister is avoiding them now, it's possible the approach was too harsh. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line between frustration and being in the wrong can be thin. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since the sister's behavior has been long-term and the author's response was direct and possibly hurtful, it's possible the author is at least partially in the wrong. However, the sister's refusal to move on might contribute to the problem too. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's actions. The sister is the one with the issue, but the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive. So, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy, even if their frustration is understandable.\n"
