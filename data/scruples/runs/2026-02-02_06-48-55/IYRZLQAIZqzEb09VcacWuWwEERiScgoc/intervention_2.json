It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister has been living with the author and their parents for about a year since the breakup. She's been moping, negative, and bitter. The ex broke up with her at the start of last year, and she hasn't dated anyone since. She's also been stalking the ex and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author told her to \"move the fuck on,\" and she's been avoiding them since.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel frustrated living with someone who's so negative, especially when it's been a year. They might not have control over the living situation since the parents own the house. But on the other hand, the sister is still dealing with grief and loss. A breakup, especially with a miscarriage involved, can have deep emotional effects. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive and invalidating of their feelings. The sister's behavior, like stalking and being bitter, might be a sign of unresolved grief, not just stubbornness. The author's approach was harsh, using a strong phrase that's not supportive. Even if the sister isn't handling it well, the author's response could have been more empathetic. \n\nBut then again, the sister hasn't shown any movement towards healing; she's been stuck in the same place for over a year. The author is in a tough spot because they can't remove her. Maybe the author is justified in feeling exasperated, but the way they expressed it was wrong. The key here is whether the author's action was the right approach. Telling someone to \"get over it\" is often seen as insensitive. The sister needs support, not criticism. The author should have approached it with more compassion, maybe encouraging her to seek help or find healthy coping mechanisms instead of just telling her to move on. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they reacted in a harsh and dismissive way rather than offering support. The answer should be A.\n"
