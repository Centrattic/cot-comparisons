It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister lives with the author, which complicates things because they don't have a formal lease. The sister is moping around, bitter, and hasn't moved on from her breakup. The author can't leave because their parents own the house and there's no lease, so they're stuck living with her. The sister's negative behavior has been ongoing for a year, and the author finally snapped, telling her to move on. Now the sister is avoiding the author.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is frustrated with the sister's constant negativity and inability to move on. It's been over a year, and the sister is still stuck in this phase, which is affecting the household environment. The author might feel that they're being supportive but also need some peace in their own home. On the other hand, the sister is dealing with grief and betrayal, which can take time. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive and invalidating. Grief isn't something that can be rushed, and the sister might need emotional support rather than advice to move on quickly.\n\nThe author's approach was direct and perhaps harsh. Instead of offering support or suggesting ways to deal with her emotions, they told her she needed to move on. This could have made the sister feel unheard and unsupported, leading to her avoiding the author. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014avoiding someone after such a confrontation is natural if they feel criticized.\n\nLegal or contractual reasons don't play a role here, but the living situation adds tension. The author might be under stress from the living arrangement and the sister's behavior. However, the key issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. While the frustration is understandable, the method of communication was likely too abrupt and lacked empathy. The author might have benefited from a more compassionate approach, encouraging the sister to seek support or counseling instead of telling her to \"get over it.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is valid, their response was likely insensitive and dismissive. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because their approach was not supportive and could have worsened the sister's emotional state.\n"
