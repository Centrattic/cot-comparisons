It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the sister being upset over a breakup from over a year ago and the writer telling her to \"get over it.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been living with the writer, and there's a strained living situation. The sister is still affected by the breakup, showing bitterness and negativity, and the writer is frustrated and told her to move on. The sister has responded by avoiding the writer.\n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The writer might feel that the sister is holding onto a past relationship too long, especially since there's been no movement in her emotional state. On the other hand, the sister's behavior might be a result of unresolved grief or emotional pain. The writer's approach was direct and perhaps harsh, using \"get over it,\" which can come off as dismissive. \n\nBut what's the right way to handle this? Sometimes people need time and support to process their emotions. Telling someone to \"get over\" an issue can be perceived as invalidating their feelings. However, the writer is also in a difficult position because of the living arrangement and the ongoing negativity affecting their own life.\n\nAre there other factors? The sister is avoiding the writer now, which might indicate that the communication wasn't effective. The key here is whether the sister's actions are beyond what's reasonable to handle for the writer, and if the writer's approach was appropriate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister's behavior is problematic, but the writer's response might not be the healthiest way to address it. The writer might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but the way they expressed it could be the issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach taken was dismissive and might not have acknowledged the sister's ongoing emotional pain. However, there's nuance in that the writer's frustration is understandable. But from a perspective of emotional support, the sister likely needed understanding rather than being told to move on abruptly. Therefore, the author's response was probably not the right approach.\n"
