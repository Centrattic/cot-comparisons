It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister is still moping about a breakup from over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The sister is now avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The sister moved in last summer, so the breakup happened right at the start of last year. That means she's been dealing with this for about a year. The author lives with her parents, so they can't just move out. The sister is described as a \"dark cloud,\" moping, bitter, and negative. She's also stalking her ex and his new girlfriend, especially since the new girlfriend is pregnant. The author, frustrated, told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, dealing with a breakup, especially one involving a miscarriage, can be complex and take time. The sister's reaction of being bitter and negative for over a year might indicate unresolved grief or emotional issues. However, the author's approach of telling her to \"get over it\" is dismissive. It doesn't account for her emotional needs or the complexity of her feelings. Instead of being supportive, the author used a confrontational approach which might have escalated the situation.\n\nIn family dynamics, especially in a shared living space, communication is key. The author might be feeling stressed from living in a negative environment, but their method of addressing it was harsh. Suggesting she move on without providing support or understanding is likely to make the sister feel invalidated. The sister's avoidance could be a result of feeling attacked rather than supported.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior is also problematic. Stalking her ex and a new relationship, especially after a year, is unhealthy. The author might be at a loss for how to handle it, leading to an outburst. But the right approach would be to encourage her to seek help or talk about her feelings instead of telling her to move on abruptly.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's comment was harsh and not supportive. They could have handled it better, which means they might be in the wrong. But the sister's behavior is also an issue. However, the question is specifically about the author's action. Since the author's response was dismissive and likely hurtful, the answer leans towards A. But I need to be careful. Sometimes in these situations, people just lash out when they're frustrated. The author might be in a tough position living with someone who's bringing them down. But the way they handled it was wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
