It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still very upset, moping around, and the author feels stuck living with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex-fianc\u00e9 ended things a year ago, and she hasn't moved on. She's bitter, negative, and fixated on her ex and his new relationship. The author, frustrated with the sister's behavior, told her to get over it. Now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, should the author be in the wrong?\n\nWell, the author's intention might have been to help their sister move on, but the way they approached it was harsh. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive, especially when they're dealing with unresolved grief or ongoing trauma. The sister's miscarriage and the recent news about her ex's new girlfriend might mean she's still dealing with deep emotional pain. The phrase \"move the fuck on\" sounds confrontational and might not validate her feelings, which could make her feel isolated instead of supported.\n\nEven though the author is stuck in the situation and frustrated, approaching the sister with empathy might be more effective. Maybe suggesting professional help or offering support instead of direct criticism. The sister might need time and emotional support rather than being told to just get over it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to improve their own living situation, which is understandable. They might feel overwhelmed by the sister's negativity. However, the way they communicated their frustration could have been handled better. It's possible the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach was hurtful.\n\nBut considering emotional support, the sister is in a vulnerable state. The author's words might have been the last straw for the sister, leading her to avoid them. In such cases, the responsibility is on the person giving advice to be more compassionate. So, even if the author's motivation was good, the execution was flawed. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and understanding.\n"
