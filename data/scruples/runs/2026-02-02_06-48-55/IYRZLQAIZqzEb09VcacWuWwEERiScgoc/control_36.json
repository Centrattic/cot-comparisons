It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the sister is still living with the author. The context mentions that the sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, and she hasn't moved on. She's been moping, being bitter, stalking her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally told her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's emotional state and the author's response. The author is frustrated with their sister's behavior, which has been ongoing for months. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests the comment hurt her feelings. \n\nI need to consider whether the author's approach was appropriate. Giving someone space to heal is important, but in this case, the sister hasn't moved on after a year. The author might feel that their own living situation is being affected by the sister's negativity. However, directly telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive and invalidating. It's possible that the author didn't take the time to understand the sister's feelings or offer support, leading to the hurtful response.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the household dynamics. The author might be under stress from the situation. But the key is how the author approached the issue. Instead of being supportive, the author used a harsh tone (\"move the fuck on\"), which could be seen as insensitive. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, the author's method of addressing it might have been too abrupt and lacking empathy.\n\nSo, while the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's approach might have been the wrong way to handle it. The author could have tried to offer support or encourage positive steps without being dismissive. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). But wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over it. If the sister hasn't moved on for a year, maybe the author has a point, but the way they said it was harsh. However, the sister's reaction shows that the author's words were hurtful. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
