It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister still being upset over a breakup from over a year ago. The author told her to \"get over it.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister lives with the author, which complicates things because they have to coexist. The breakup happened a year ago, and since then, the sister has been acting negatively, not dating, stalking the ex, and getting upset about his new relationship and pregnancy. The author's comment was a direct tell-off, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nNow, considering the sister's behavior, she's been dealing with the breakup for a long time. The fact that she had a miscarriage during the relationship might mean the breakup was particularly traumatic for her. The author's frustration is understandable, especially living together and being affected by her negativity. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, grief and recovery from a breakup, especially with a miscarriage involved, can take a long time. It's not just about moving on quickly. The author's approach was blunt: \"move the fuck on and get over it.\" That might come off as dismissive of her feelings. While the author's intent was probably to help, the way it was phrased could be seen as uncaring or minimizing her sister's pain.\n\nHowever, the sister's continued focus on the ex, even a year later, and her bitterness might make others feel that she's not processing her emotions in a healthy way. The author might be in a difficult position, trying to maintain their own well-being while sharing a living space. But pushing someone to \"get over it\" without support can be harmful. The sister might need help rather than criticism.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's direct approach was appropriate. If the sister is still struggling a year later, maybe she's not ready to move on, and the author's comment was insensitive. The author isn't in the wrong if they were trying to encourage their sister to stop being stuck, but the method could be questioned. However, in AITA scenarios, the way of handling the situation is often more important than the intent. The sister's behavior is clearly problematic, but so is the author's harsh response. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, while the sister's behavior is bad, the author's response might have been too direct. The right approach would be to offer support or suggest counseling. Telling someone to \"get over\" a deep loss without empathy could be seen as the author's fault. Therefore, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But some might argue that the sister is overreacting and the author has a right to set boundaries. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is about perspective. In AITA posts, the tone and the approach are often scrutinized. The author's language was harsh, so they might be considered at fault here. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
