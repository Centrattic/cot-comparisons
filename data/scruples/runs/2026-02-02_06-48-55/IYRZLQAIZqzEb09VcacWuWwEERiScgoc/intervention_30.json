It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still affected by the breakup, has a lot of negative emotions, and the author is frustrated living with her. The sister's ex is with someone new, and she's been very bitter about it.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dealing with this for a year. She's still really upset, stalking social media, and the breakup happened after a miscarriage. The author tells her she needs to move on. The sister is now avoiding them.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. The sister is still grieving, and the author's response might be seen as dismissive. Even though the author is frustrated, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be hurtful, especially if they're still in emotional pain. The author's sister might need more support rather than being told to move on. The author might not realize the depth of their sister's pain. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more empathetic. But maybe there's also the context of living together and the stress that comes with that. However, even in that situation, the way the author communicated their frustration could be problematic. So I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't approach the situation with enough empathy and understanding.\n"
