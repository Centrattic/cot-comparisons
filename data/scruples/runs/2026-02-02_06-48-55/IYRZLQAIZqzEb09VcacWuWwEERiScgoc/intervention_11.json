It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still living with the author, and the author feels stuck because of the living situation. The sister has been moping, is bitter, and hasn't moved on, which the author finds frustrating.\n\nFirst, the sister's ex broke up a year ago, but the sister is still dealing with the aftermath, including the ex's new relationship and a pregnancy. The author's sister is clearly struggling, and the author, in frustration, told her to move on. The sister is now avoiding the author. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The sister is dealing with a long-term emotional issue, possibly compounded by the miscarriage. Grief and heartbreak can last longer than a year, especially if the relationship was significant. The author might feel that the sister is not handling the situation well, especially since it's affecting their shared living environment. However, the author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it,\" which can come off as dismissive. Instead of supporting her through the process, the author is pushing her to move on, which might not be helpful. It's possible the sister needs empathy and support rather than pressure to move on. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it could be hurtful. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being supportive and instead being harsh. Answer A.\n"
