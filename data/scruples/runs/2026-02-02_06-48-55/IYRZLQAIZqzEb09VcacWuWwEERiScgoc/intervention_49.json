It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister has been moping for over a year after a breakup. The author, who can't do much because of the living situation, finally tells her to get over it. The sister then avoids them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The sister is living with the author, and the breakup happened over a year ago. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment negatively. The sister is bitter, negative, and focused on her ex and his new relationship. The author is frustrated and tells her to move on, which leads to tension.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the sister's behavior is problematic and has been ongoing. The author might feel that they can't live in such a toxic environment and had to set a boundary. On the other hand, telling someone to get over a breakup, especially when it's been a year but still causing pain, might not be helpful. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, using \"move the fuck on,\" which sounds dismissive.\n\nI should consider if the author's response was appropriate. Maybe the author could have approached it with more empathy, acknowledging the sister's pain before urging her to move on. But given the sister's behavior affecting their shared living space, the author might feel justified in setting a boundary. However, the method of communication seems harsh, which could make the author at fault. Alternatively, if the sister's behavior is unreasonable and the author is just asking her to stop, maybe it's not their fault. But the key here is the sister's ongoing negative attitude and the author's response. The author might be in the wrong for not being compassionate enough, even if the sister's behavior is poor. So I'm a bit torn. The answer might depend on whether the author's approach was too harsh despite the sister's issues. Maybe the author is at fault for the way they communicated, but if the sister is being toxic, the author might have a valid point. Hmm. I think the author is in the wrong because they could have handled it with more empathy, even if the sister needs to move on. So the answer is A.\n"
