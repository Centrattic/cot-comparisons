It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still very upset, hasn't dated since, and is bitter. The author told her to \"move the fuck on,\" and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, the sister's situation: her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been dealing with it by moping, being bitter, stalking his social media, and reacting negatively to his new girlfriend's pregnancy. She had a miscarriage during their relationship. The author feels stuck living with her because of the parents' ownership of the house.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the sister hasn't moved on, and they told her to get over it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the sister has been dealing with this for over a year, which isn't that short a time. However, grief and moving on can vary for everyone. The author's comment was direct and maybe harsh. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can invalidate their feelings, especially if they're still struggling. The sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) might indicate she's not coping well, but the author's approach of telling her to move on might not be supportive. It's possible the author could have approached it with more empathy, offering support instead of judgment. \n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? They were frustrated and tried to set boundaries. However, their method might not have been the best. The sister's avoidance suggests the comment hurt her. So, the author might be in the wrong for not showing more support and understanding, even if the sister's behavior was difficult. \n\nAnswer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate because the approach taken was harsh and dismissive of the sister's feelings, even if the sister's behavior was problematic. The author could have handled it more compassionately.\n"
