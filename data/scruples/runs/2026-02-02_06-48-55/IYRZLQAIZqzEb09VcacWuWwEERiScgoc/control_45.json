It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago is in the wrong. The sister has been living with the author, and since the breakup, she's been really negative, stalking her ex, and the author just had enough. They told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, but she's still very much affected. The author is living with her and dealing with her negativity daily. The sister's behavior includes moping around, being bitter, and obsessing over her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author, feeling frustrated, tells her to get over it. The sister avoids them after that.\n\nNow, the key points here are the timing of the breakup (over a year ago), the sister's ongoing emotional state, and the author's reaction. The question is whether the author's response was inappropriate. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that a year is a long time to dwell on a breakup. They might be struggling with their sister's constant negativity and want her to move on for her own sake and theirs. But on the other hand, everyone processes grief and breakups differently. A year is a long time, but some people take longer. The sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) suggests she's still deeply affected. The author's direct approach might have been harsh, especially if the sister wasn't ready to hear it. Telling someone to \"get over\" something can come off as dismissive of their feelings, even if the intention is to help.\n\nHowever, the sister's actions are impacting the author's living environment. The author might not be at fault for setting a boundary after a long period of negative behavior. But the method of communication\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as harsh. It's possible the author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it might have been too blunt, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't approach the situation with empathy. Instead of understanding the sister's ongoing pain, they told her to move on, which could invalidate her feelings. The sister's avoidance is a reaction to being dismissed. So, even though the author's frustration is understandable, their approach was likely unhelpful and hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
