It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. Their sister is living with them, and the situation is causing tension. The sister has been really down, negative, and is still fixated on her ex, including stalking him and being upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author finally told their sister to move on.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior has been ongoing for a while. A breakup over a year ago is a significant amount of time, but healing can vary. However, the sister's reaction now includes bitterness, avoidance, and fixation on her ex. The author's sister might be stuck in grief or depression, which isn't uncommon after a breakup, especially with a miscarriage involved. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her to move on. While the sister's behavior might be difficult, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive of their feelings. This could come off as invalidating, especially if the sister is struggling with unresolved emotions. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, the author's approach might have been harsh, potentially making her feel unsupported instead of comforted.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a shared living situation with no formal agreement, which complicates things. They might feel overwhelmed by their sister's negativity and are trying to assert boundaries. That's understandable, but the way they expressed it might not be the most constructive. Instead of telling her to move on, perhaps offering support or suggesting professional help could be better. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about empathy versus directness. The author might have good intentions but used a blunt method. The sister's avoidance suggests the comment hurt her. So, while the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's approach might have been unhelpful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault for not handling it more compassionately.\n"
