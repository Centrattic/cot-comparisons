It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't really move out. The sister has been moping since her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago. She's bitter, negative, stalks his social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now she's avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The sister is dealing with a breakup that's over a year old, but she's still stuck in negative emotions. The author is frustrated and tells her to \"get over it.\" The sister's behavior is affecting their shared living space. The author can't move out because of their parents' ownership of the house. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be right to express frustration, especially if the sister's behavior is impacting their quality of life. They might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, even if it's been a year, can be hurtful. The sister is still grieving and dealing with loss, which is a personal process. The author's approach might be dismissive of her feelings, even if their intent was to encourage her to move on.\n\nBut the sister's behavior is also problematic. Stalking ex's social media and being negative for that long could be a sign that she's struggling. However, the author is also trying to live with her and can't leave. Maybe the author's approach was harsh, but maybe they're justified because of the sister's ongoing negativity.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often a balance. Sometimes the person who's frustrated is seen as the asshole, but if the other person is being unreasonable, the frustration is understandable. The key here is whether the author's words were cruel versus a legitimate expression of their need for the sister to stop being negative. \n\nThe sister's actions (avoiding work, moping, stalking) are unhealthy, but the author's response was to tell her to \"get over it.\" That could be seen as invalidating her feelings. People have different grief timelines, and a year might not be enough for some. The author might not be wrong for speaking up, but they might have been inconsiderate in how they did it. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be right to say something because the sister's behavior is affecting the household. So, depending on the perspective, it's a tough call. However, in similar cases, people often argue that telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup is insensitive, even if the person is acting out. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because the sister's behavior is also terrible.\n"
