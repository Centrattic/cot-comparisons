It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is living with them, and there's no formal lease, so the user can't just kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister's ex broke up with her last year, and she's been moping ever since. She's bitter, negative, stalks social media, and is upset about her ex's new girlfriend getting pregnant. The user, frustrated, told her to move on, which led to the sister avoiding them now.\n\nThe key points here are the time frame and the sister's behavior. The breakup happened over a year ago, which is a long time to be stuck in negative emotions. The sister isn't just sad; she's been avoiding dating, is bitter, and is obsessing over her ex. The user is living in the same house, so the sister's behavior is affecting their life as well.\n\nNow, the user's response was to tell her to \"move the fuck on and get over it.\" That's pretty harsh language, but given the context, maybe the user felt pushed to that point. The sister's behavior might be toxic in a shared living space.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, while the sister's actions are problematic, the user's approach might have been too direct. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can minimize their feelings. However, the user's frustration is understandable, given the shared living situation and the sister's prolonged negativity.\n\nAlso, considering the sister had a miscarriage, which might add to the emotional complexity. The user might not have considered that in their response. But the sister's reaction to the ex's new girlfriend being pregnant seems overly sensitive, especially after a year.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister's actions are affecting the user's quality of life. The user might not be at fault for trying to set boundaries, even if their delivery was harsh. However, a better approach might have been to express concerns without being dismissive of her feelings.\n\nBut the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since they were trying to address a long-standing issue that's affecting both their lives, and the sister's behavior is indeed problematic, the user might not be in the wrong. However, the way they communicated it could be seen as insensitive. But given the circumstances, maybe they're justified in their frustration.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the sister's behavior is the root issue, and the user is trying to manage a difficult living situation. However, there's a nuance here. The user's approach could have been more empathetic, but they're not entirely at fault.\n"
