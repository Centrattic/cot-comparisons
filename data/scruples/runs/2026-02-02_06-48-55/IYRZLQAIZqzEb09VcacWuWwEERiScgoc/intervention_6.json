It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister lives with the author, and they don't have a formal lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, bitter, and negative since. She's also been focused on her ex's new relationship, especially since his girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is right or wrong. Let's consider the factors.\n\nOn one hand, the sister has been dealing with this breakup for a year, which is a significant amount of time. The author is living in the same house and dealing with her constant negativity, which is hard. The author might feel frustrated and want the sister to stop being negative and move on. But on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when they have a history of a miscarriage, might be dismissive of her feelings. It's possible the sister is still grieving and the author's approach is too harsh. \n\nHowever, the sister's behavior includes stalking the ex and his new relationship, which might indicate she's stuck in the past. The author's frustration is understandable given the living situation. But the way the author expressed it\u2014telling her to \"get over it\"\u2014could be seen as invalidating her emotions. People process grief and heartbreak differently, and a year might not be enough time for her. The author's comment might have come across as unsupportive, even if the intention was to help.\n\nAlso, the sister's actions (avoiding the author) suggest that the author's words hurt her feelings. It's possible the author didn't consider the sister's emotional state and instead gave a blunt response. In conflict resolution, empathy is key. The author might have needed to approach the situation with more compassion rather than direct confrontation.\n\nBut considering the sister's ongoing negative behavior and the living situation, the author isn't entirely wrong for feeling that the sister needs to move on. However, the method of communication was probably harsh. There might be a better way to address the sister's behavior without being dismissive.\n\nSo, balancing these points, the author might be partially at fault for the way they expressed their frustration. The sister's actions are problematic, but the author's approach could have been more supportive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA being A (author is in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the sister is in the wrong for her behavior, but the author's approach was also flawed. The question is whether the author is more in the wrong. Given that the sister's behavior is ongoing and the author is trying to help but in a harsh way, the answer might be A, but I need to be careful.\n"
