It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe author lives with their sister, who broke up with her fianc\u00e9 over a year ago. The sister hasn't moved on, is bitter, mopes around, stalks her ex and his new girlfriend. The author told her to \"get over it\" and now the sister is avoiding them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nHmm. First, the sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year. The author's sister is still really upset, hasn't dated since, is on social media stalking, and is bitter. The author, living in the same house without a lease, can't really leave. Their sister's behavior is affecting the household environment negatively. The author told their sister to move on, which led to tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, grief and emotional pain don't have a timeline. Even though it's been a year, the sister is still struggling. The author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it\" and \"move on,\" which might not be supportive. Maybe the author should have tried to understand or encourage professional help instead of being dismissive. But the sister's behavior is affecting the author's life as well. They can't just ignore it. However, telling someone to get over their pain might come across as insensitive, even if the other person is being difficult. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they addressed it might be the issue. So perhaps the author is partially at fault for not handling it more compassionately. But since they are in a difficult living situation, maybe they're not entirely wrong. The answer might be A (yes), because pushing someone to move on can be harmful, but also B (no) because the sister's behavior is affecting the author. But the key is whether the author's approach was wrong. I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't support their sister and instead dismissed her feelings, which isn't helpful. So answer A.\n"
