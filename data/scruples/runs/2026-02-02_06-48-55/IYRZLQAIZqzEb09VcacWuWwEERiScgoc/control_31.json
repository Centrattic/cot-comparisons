It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still living with them, and the author feels stuck because the parents own the house. The sister has been moping, isn't dating, is bitter, stalks her ex, and the author told her to move on.\n\nFirst, the time frame: the breakup was over a year ago. A year is a long time, but healing varies. The sister's behavior\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking\u2014suggests she's struggling. The author might feel frustrated, especially living together without a lease, leading to tension. The author's comment was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could be seen as dismissive. The sister is avoiding them now, which is a negative outcome.\n\nConsider empathy: the sister had a miscarriage, which adds trauma. The author might not fully grasp the emotional impact. The sister's reaction could be justified if she feels unsupported. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the living situation. But was the approach right? Telling someone to \"get over\" something, especially with such bluntness, can feel invalidating. It might not help her process emotions and could push her away. So, the author's intention to help might be there, but the method was harsh. The sister's ongoing emotional state is valid, and the author's response might be seen as lacking support. So, leaning towards AITA? Maybe the author is in the wrong because of the harsh approach and not acknowledging the sister's pain.\n"
