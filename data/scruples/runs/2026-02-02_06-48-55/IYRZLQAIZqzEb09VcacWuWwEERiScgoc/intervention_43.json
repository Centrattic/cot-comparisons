It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister lives with the author because the house is owned by their parents and rented out, so the author can't just move out. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and since then, she's been moping, bitter, and stalking her ex's social media. The author finally told her to move on, leading to the sister avoiding them now.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The author's frustration is understandable, especially living together and dealing with her negativity. But on the other hand, the breakup is a personal and emotional experience. The sister might still be grieving, and the author's approach of telling her to \"get over it\" could be dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the breakup, the sister's emotional state, and the author's communication style. The author might have wanted to help but didn't approach it compassionately. Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as harsh, especially if the person is still struggling. Maybe a more supportive or empathetic approach would have been better. However, the sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) is also problematic. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it might have been hurtful.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity. Even if the sister's behavior is difficult, the author could have tried to understand her feelings instead of directly telling her to move on. It's possible the sister still needs support, and the author's reaction might have made her feel unsupported. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
