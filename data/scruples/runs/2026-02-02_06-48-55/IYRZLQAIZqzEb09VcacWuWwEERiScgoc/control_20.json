It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago is in the wrong. The sister has been living with them, and since there's no lease, the situation is tricky. The sister is still upset, moping, and acting bitter, which the author finds hard to handle. The author's sister is avoiding them after being told to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The sister lost her engagement, had a miscarriage, and then the breakup. That's a lot of trauma. A year later, she's still struggling, which the author points out by saying she's \"moping\" and \"bitter.\" The author intervened by telling her to \"get over it,\" which might seem harsh. But maybe they were trying to help her move on or stop the negativity affecting their home life.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction is understandable. Grieving takes time, especially after such significant events. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though the breakup was a year ago, the sister is still dealing with the aftermath, including the new development about her ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. That's a fresh wound that could trigger more pain.\n\nThe author's motivation is important here. Were they trying to be supportive but not knowing how, or were they being impatient? The sister's behavior is affecting the household, so maybe the author felt cornered. However, the way they addressed it\u2014telling her to \"get over it\"\u2014could have been more empathetic. Suggesting therapy or offering support might have been better than a direct confrontation.\n\nAlso, considering the living situation: no lease means the author can't ask her to leave, so the tension is higher. The sister's negativity is affecting the author's life, so their frustration is valid. But pushing someone to move on too quickly can backfire, making them feel misunderstood.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is understandable, the approach taken was likely too harsh. The sister is still in a vulnerable state, and the author's response may have been dismissive of her ongoing emotional needs. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough compassion and understanding, which could have led to the sister avoiding them.\n"
