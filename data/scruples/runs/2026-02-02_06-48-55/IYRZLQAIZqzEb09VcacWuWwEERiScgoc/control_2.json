It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister is still really upset about a breakup over a year ago. The author, living in the same house and stuck there because of parents owning the house, is frustrated. The sister mopes around, stalks her ex, and is bitter. The author told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is still living with the author, and there's no lease or agreement. The author is probably under a lot of stress from the sister's behavior. But how long has this been going on? Over a year. The sister's ex broke up with her at the beginning of last year. The sister hasn't dated since and is still very negative. The author's frustration is understandable, but is it right to tell someone to \"get over it\"?\n\nEmotionally, people grieve breakups differently. Some take longer than others. The sister had a miscarriage, which adds another layer of trauma. The author might not fully understand the depth of her sister's pain. Also, the sister's behavior\u2014stalking ex's social media, being bitter\u2014might be a way of dealing with her emotions. But the author is also in a difficult position, living under the same roof and dealing with her negativity daily.\n\nIs the author's advice valid? Telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive. Even if the author is frustrated, the approach might be too harsh. It's possible the sister needs support rather than criticism. However, the author is also under pressure because they can't leave. Maybe they're trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is in a family situation. Family members might have different expectations of each other compared to roommates with a formal agreement. The lack of a lease complicates things, but the living arrangement is a reality both have to deal with. The author might feel like they're doing the right thing by pushing the sister to move on, but the sister might feel hurt or blamed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who caused the breakup. They're just reacting to the sister's ongoing behavior. However, their approach might not be the most helpful. Instead of telling her to \"get over it,\" maybe the author should encourage the sister to seek professional help or find other outlets for her emotions. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for directly telling her to move on.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's frustration is valid, but the method they used might not be appropriate. The sister's emotional state is complex, involving past trauma. The author's comment could have been insensitive even if their intention was to help. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their approach was harsh and potentially dismissive of the sister's pain. But some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're just setting boundaries in a difficult living situation. However, the key issue is the sister's well-being versus the author's frustration. It's a tough call, but the author's response was probably not the best way to handle it.\n"
