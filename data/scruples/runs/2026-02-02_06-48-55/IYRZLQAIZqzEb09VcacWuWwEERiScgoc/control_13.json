It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the sister being stuck living with her sister because of the housing arrangement. The author's sister is grieving a breakup from over a year ago and is acting out by being negative and bitter. The author told her to \"get over it,\" and now the sister is avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is dealing with prolonged grief and possibly depression. The author is frustrated because the sister's negativity is affecting their home environment. The key points are: the breakup is over a year old, the sister is still moping, there's no formal lease making it hard for them to move out, and the author's response was blunt.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, grief doesn't have a set timeline. What one person might consider moving on after a year might not be true for another. The sister's actions (stalking ex, bitterness) might indicate unresolved issues. The author's reaction was to tell her to \"get over it,\" which could be dismissive of her feelings. Even though the author is in a difficult situation, their approach might have been invalidating.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a tough spot, living in the same house and dealing with constant negativity. They might feel it's their right to ask for a better living environment. But pushing someone to move on too quickly can be harmful. It's possible the sister needs support rather than criticism. The author's tone (\"move the fuck on\") is harsh, which might have caused the sister to withdraw further.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's approach was wrong. The sister's ongoing grief isn't necessarily the author's fault, but the way they addressed it might be. The author could have handled it with more empathy instead of bluntly telling them to move on. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their response was dismissive and harsh, not considering the sister's emotional state.\n"
