It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with the author, but there's no formal lease, so they can't just kick her out. The sister has been moping since the breakup, and now she's upset because her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's breakup was over a year ago, but she's still dealing with it. The author is frustrated because the sister is negative and bitter, which affects their living environment. The author's main point is that the sister hasn't moved on and is being overly negative, so they confronted her. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the sister's behavior is problematic\u2014being negative, avoiding dating, and fixated on her ex. The author is trying to address this by telling her to move on, which might seem harsh but is perhaps out of concern for their own well-being. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when it's been a year, might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author is in a difficult living situation, the approach might not be the most supportive. \n\nBut the sister's behavior has been going on for a while, and the author is in a tough spot because they can't remove her. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way they expressed it (\"get over it\") could be hurtful. It's possible that the author should have tried a more empathetic approach, like encouraging support or therapy, rather than being confrontational. \n\nBut considering the sister's behavior and the author's inability to leave, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The sister's actions are affecting the household, so the author's intervention might be necessary. Still, the method could be questioned. But the answer depends on whether \"in the wrong\" means solely responsible for the conflict. Since the sister's behavior is the root cause, the author's reaction, while perhaps poorly worded, is a response to that. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
