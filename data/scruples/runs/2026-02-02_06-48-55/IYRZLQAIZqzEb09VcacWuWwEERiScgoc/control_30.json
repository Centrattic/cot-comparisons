It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister is still upset about a breakup from over a year ago, and the author told her to get over it. The sister now avoids them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. The author might feel that the sister is holding onto negative emotions for too long, which is impacting their living situation.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is dealing with a breakup and a miscarriage, which are significant emotional events. Stalking the ex's social media and being bitter for a year might indicate unresolved grief or ongoing emotional distress. The author's frustration is understandable, especially living under the same roof and dealing with her negativity daily.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive of their feelings. It's possible the sister is still in the healing process, and the author's comment might have been insensitive, even if the intention was to encourage moving on. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests that the comment hurt her feelings.\n\nI should also consider the context of their living arrangement. Since the author is stuck in the situation, they might feel trapped by the sister's behavior. However, the sister's emotional state is a personal and complex issue. The author might not have handled it the best way by being direct and harsh, but they are also dealing with the consequences of living with someone who's not moving on.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The sister might need support rather than criticism. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it might have been hurtful. So, is the author in the wrong? They might be partially responsible for not approaching the sister with more empathy. However, the sister's behavior is also problematic. The key is whether the author's words were cruel or just a misguided attempt to help.\n\nGiven that the author used strong language (\"move the fuck on\") and the sister is still dealing with emotional trauma, the author's approach could be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the sister's behavior is also a factor. The community might not place all the blame on the author but acknowledge both sides. Hmm, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister is still grieving, telling her to \"get over\" it could be dismissive. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
