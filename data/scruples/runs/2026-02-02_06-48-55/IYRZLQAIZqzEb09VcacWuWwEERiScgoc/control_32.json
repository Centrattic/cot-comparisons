It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister lives with the author, and they share the house because their parents own it. The sister's ex broke up with her last year, and she hasn't moved on. She's been moping, bitter, and even more upset since her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's emotional state and the author's approach. The author might feel frustrated living with someone who's so negative, especially when it's affecting the household. But the sister is still grieving, which can take time. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction was wrong. Well, the sister has been dealing with this for over a year and is still struggling. The author's outburst was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), which could come off as dismissive. Even if the author is frustrated, telling someone to \"get over\" a significant emotional event can be insensitive. \n\nBut then, the sister hasn't made any effort to move on, like dating again or engaging in activities. The author might feel they can't escape the negativity. However, the right approach might be to offer support instead of criticism. So, the author's intention might be to help, but the method was wrong. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often need empathy rather than pressure. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests that the comment hurt her feelings. So, the author might have overstepped by not considering her emotional needs. \n\nOn the flip side, the sister isn't making an effort to improve her situation. But the author's responsibility isn't to force her to move on but to communicate in a supportive way. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for the way they expressed their frustration.\n\nI think the answer is A, meaning the author is in the wrong. The approach was too harsh and dismissive, even if the frustration is understandable. Emotional support should be more compassionate.\n"
