It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The sister is still living with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author feels stuck. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, but she's still very negative, bitter, and hasn't moved on. She's also been reacting strongly to her ex's new relationship and a pregnancy. The author finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's actions were appropriate. On one hand, the sister's behavior has been ongoing and negative, affecting the household. The author might feel frustrated and want her to move on for the sake of their living situation. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when they've been through trauma like a miscarriage, can be dismissive of their feelings. It's possible the author didn't consider the emotional impact of their words, even if the sister's behavior is problematic.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might not have tried other approaches first, like offering support or suggesting therapy. Instead of bluntly telling her to move on, maybe a more empathetic approach could have been better. However, the sister's behavior has been prolonged, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a balance between respecting the sister's emotional process and addressing the negative impact on the household. The key here is whether the author's response was supportive or dismissive. Since the author used harsh language (\"move the fuck on\") and didn't acknowledge the sister's feelings, it's likely the author was inconsiderate, even if their frustration is valid. So, probably AITA for the author.\n"
