It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the person telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been living with them, moping, being bitter, and is still upset about her ex's new relationship and pregnancy.\n\nThe writer says they couldn't handle it anymore and told their sister to move on. The sister is now avoiding them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. They want an answer A or B: A meaning yes, the author is in the wrong; B meaning no, they're not.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, but she's still stuck in sadness and negativity. She's not dating, stalking social media, and is bitter. The writer feels stuck because they can't move out due to their parents owning the house. They finally snapped and told their sister to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's emotional state and the writer's approach. The writer might think they're helping by pushing their sister to move on, but the sister might feel hurt or criticized. The writer's frustration is understandable given the living situation, but their method of addressing it could be harsh. \n\nIn these kinds of family dynamics, empathy is crucial. The sister is dealing with loss and possibly unresolved grief. The writer's approach was direct and possibly lacking in compassion. Even if the sister hasn't moved on, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive of their feelings. It's possible the sister needs support rather than criticism. The writer might not be in the wrong in wanting peace, but their method might be the issue here. \n\nAnother angle: the sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, making the writer feel trapped in a negative atmosphere. They might be struggling with their own stress from the situation. However, the way they addressed it could have been more supportive. Instead of telling her to \"get over it,\" maybe suggesting professional help or offering to talk would have been better. \n\nSo, considering the sister's emotional state and the writer's approach, it's possible the writer is in the wrong for being unsupportive. However, if the sister was causing significant disruption, there might be some justification. But given the description, the sister's behavior is ongoing and the writer's reaction was abrupt. \n\nI think the key here is that the writer's tone and approach were not helpful. They might not be malicious, but their words were hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe the sister is being unreasonable, so the writer's frustration is valid. But the way they expressed it is problematic. So A.\n"
