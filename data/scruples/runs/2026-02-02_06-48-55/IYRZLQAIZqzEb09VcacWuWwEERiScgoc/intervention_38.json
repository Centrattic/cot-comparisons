It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. Let me start by reading the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe sister lives with the author, and they can't move out because the parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over a year ago, and since then, she's been really down, negative, and bitter. The author says she's been moping around like a dark cloud. The sister hasn't dated anyone since and claims she's done with dating. She stalks her ex's social media, and the ex's new girlfriend is pregnant, which has made the sister even more upset. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to see my thoughts. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dealing with a breakup for over a year. That's a significant amount of time, but everyone grieves and processes differently. The sister's behavior is described as negative and bitter, which the author finds frustrating. The sister is still fixated on the ex, which might indicate she's not moving on. The author might feel that staying negative is affecting the household environment, so they confronted her.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, telling someone to \"get over it\" might come off as dismissive. Even if the sister is stuck in a negative state, the way the author approached it could be the problem. Instead of being empathetic, the author gave a direct order, which might not be the best approach. The sister might feel hurt by the author's harsh words, leading her to avoid them. \n\nAlso, the sister is dealing with a miscarriage and the breakup, which are both major life events. The author's response might not consider the emotional depth of her sister's pain. While the author might feel entitled to speak out because they're stuck living together, their approach could be seen as lacking compassion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be frustrated with the ongoing negativity and feel they need to address it for their own well-being. But even so, the method of confrontation is important. Maybe a more supportive approach would be better than a blunt \"move on.\"\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their approach was too harsh and dismissive of their sister's feelings. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could be seen as invalidating. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and understanding, even if the sister's behavior was difficult.\n"
