It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister who's been moping since her breakup over a year ago, and the writer told her to get over it. The sister is bitter, negative, and fixated on her ex and his new relationship. The writer feels stuck living with her and finally snapped, telling her to move on. The sister is now avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer lives with their sister because their parents own the house and there's no lease. The sister has been negative since the breakup a year ago. The writer's frustration has built up, leading them to confront the sister directly. The question is whether this confrontation makes the writer at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the sister's behavior is clearly unhealthy and affecting the household. Stalking ex's social media and being bitter for a year might be a sign she's not handling the breakup well. The writer might feel they can't stand the negativity anymore and are trying to help her move on. But on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially after a year, could come off as dismissive. Breakups can have long-term emotional impacts, and the writer's approach might be seen as harsh or invalidating of their sister's feelings.\n\nHowever, the sister's behavior has been ongoing for over a year, and the writer is in a difficult situation, living together without control over the living arrangement. The writer might not have other options, so their frustration is understandable. But the way they addressed it\u2014telling the sister to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as insensitive, even if the intention was to help.\n\nConsider if the writer used a more empathetic approach, like suggesting professional help or encouraging positive outlets, instead of being confrontational. But the sister has been avoiding the writer since, which might indicate that the approach was too harsh. The key here is whether the writer's response was appropriate given the sister's ongoing emotional state and the circumstances of their living situation.\n\nIn some cases, family members might feel they need to step in when loved ones are stuck in unhealthy patterns. However, the method of intervention matters. The writer's direct and forceful comment might not be the best way to support their sister emotionally. They might be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more compassion, even if their intentions were good. Alternatively, considering the sister's prolonged negativity and the writer's lack of control over the situation, the writer might be justified in trying to set boundaries or encourage her to seek help.\n\nBut the main issue is the sister's emotional well-being and the writer's approach. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the writer's response could be seen as dismissive. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being A (author is at fault) because they didn't handle it in a supportive way. However, given the sister's prolonged issues and the writer's circumstances, maybe the answer is B (not at fault). It's a bit of a toss-up, but the key is whether the writer's approach was unkind versus necessary given the situation.\n"
