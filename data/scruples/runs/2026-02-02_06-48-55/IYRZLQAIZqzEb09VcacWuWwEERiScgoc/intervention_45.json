It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is living with them, and there's a lot of negative behavior involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, but she's been moping around, stalking his social media, and now she's upset because his new girlfriend is pregnant. She has a history of a miscarriage with him. The author told her to get over it, and now their sister is avoiding them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to say that. On one hand, it's been a year, and the sister hasn't moved on. The author might feel frustrated, especially living together. But on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup, especially when they're still dealing with trauma (like a miscarriage), could be dismissive. \n\nI think the key points are the timing and the sister's emotional state. A year is a while, but if she's still dealing with unresolved feelings and grief, the author's comment might come off as insensitive. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's approach might have been harsh. Maybe they could have addressed the issue more compassionately, encouraging her to seek support rather than telling her to just move on. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I can see why. Telling someone to \"get over\" something like this can feel invalidating. Even if the sister is being difficult, the author's method of addressing it might have been unhelpful. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
