It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been moping for a year, is bitter, and the author snapped at her.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior is clearly affecting the household. She's been dealing with the breakup for a year, which is a long time. The author feels stuck because of the living situation with parents. The sister is still upset, stalking the ex, and the author finally told her to move on. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the sister hasn't moved on, and her negativity is creating a bad environment. The author might feel frustrated and think that the sister should take responsibility for her emotions. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive. Grief and heartbreak aren't something you just \"get over,\" and the sister's reaction might be a sign that she needs support rather than criticism.\n\nThe author's approach might have been harsh, even if their intention was to help. The sister's miscarriage adds another layer of trauma, which might not have been adequately addressed. The author's comment could have been a way to express frustration but might not be the right way to handle it. \n\nConsidering that the sister is avoiding the author now, it shows that the confrontation had negative effects. The author might have needed to approach the situation with more empathy instead of direct criticism. So, while the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's method of addressing it could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it with the necessary sensitivity.\n"
