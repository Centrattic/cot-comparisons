It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still really upset, bitter, and negative, which is affecting their shared living situation. The author feels stuck because the parents own the house and there's no lease, so they can't move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister's breakup happened over a year ago, but she's still dealing with it by being negative and bitter. The author, frustrated by her behavior, told her to move on. The sister is avoiding them now. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom an emotional perspective, telling someone to \"get over\" a long-term issue might come off as dismissive. Even if the sister's behavior is difficult, the author's approach might not have been empathetic. The sister is dealing with loss and possibly unresolved feelings, which isn't something that can be fixed by a simple command to move on. The author might not have considered the sister's emotional state or the depth of her grief.\n\nAlso, the living situation complicates things. They can't just move out, so conflict resolution is important. The author's frustration is understandable, but their response might have been harsh. Perhaps a better approach would have been to suggest support or therapy rather than telling the sister to stop feeling a certain way.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister hasn't dated in over a year and is still clinging to the past, which is affecting their shared life. The author might feel they have a right to a more positive environment. However, pushing someone to move on without addressing the underlying issues can be counterproductive.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to tell someone to \"move on,\" but the method matters. The author's tone (\"move the fuck on\") was probably too direct and lacking in compassion. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author is a sign that the author's approach hurt her feelings, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nSo, considering the sister's ongoing emotional struggle and the author's dismissive approach, it's likely the author is in the wrong. They could have handled the situation with more empathy and understanding, perhaps by encouraging the sister to seek support or counseling instead of directly telling her to get over it.\n"
