It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The sister is upset because her sister-in-law (the author) told her to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The context is that the author lives with her sister, and the sister has been acting out since the breakup, moping, being bitter, etc. The author told her to move on, and now they're avoiding each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has been dealing with the breakup for over a year, which is a long time. The author might feel frustrated because the sister's behavior is affecting their living situation. But the sister is still in emotional pain, which is normal, even if it's been a while. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh\u2014telling her to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive. People process grief and breakups differently, and a year isn't necessarily a magic number where someone should be \"over it.\" The sister is also dealing with the fact that her ex has a new partner who's pregnant, which adds to her pain. The author might not have considered the depth of her sister's emotions or the validity of her feelings. Instead of being supportive, the author took a confrontational approach. Even though the author is stuck living with her and can't avoid the situation, their response might have been too harsh. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle it with empathy. But then again, the sister has been moping for a long time, and the author might be feeling overwhelmed. However, the right approach would be to support the sister through her grief rather than tell her to move on. So, probably answer A (in the wrong).\n"
