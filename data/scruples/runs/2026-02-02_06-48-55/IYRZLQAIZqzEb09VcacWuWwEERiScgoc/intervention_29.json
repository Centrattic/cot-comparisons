It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The key points are: the author told their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago, the sister is still upset, bitter, and moping, the author feels stuck living with her since their parents own the house and there's no lease.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's emotional state. A breakup is a significant event, and even after a year, she's still affected. She's been through a miscarriage with her ex, which adds to the complexity. Her behavior\u2014moping, being negative, stalking social media, and expressing bitterness\u2014suggests she's struggling to move on. The author's response was telling her to \"get over it,\" which might come off as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially since they're living together and dealing with the sister's negativity daily. However, the sister's emotional pain isn't something that can be fixed with a simple command. The author might not have considered the sister's need for support or the depth of her unresolved feelings. Dismissing her emotions could have worsened the situation, leading to avoidance and a strained relationship.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, grief and heartbreak can linger, and people process them differently. The author's approach was direct, but it might have lacked empathy. Instead of telling her to move on, maybe the author could have offered support or encouraged her to seek help. However, the sister's behavior might also be exacerbating the issue, making it hard for the author to cope. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author's intention was to end the negativity, but their method was harsh. The sister's actions are hurtful, but the author's response might have been too dismissive. The question is whether the author is at fault. Since the sister's emotional state is complex and the author's response was abrupt without addressing her needs, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. But based on the sister's ongoing struggle and the author's dismissive comment, the answer is likely A.\n"
