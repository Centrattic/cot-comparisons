Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister lives with the author because the parents own the house and rent it to the author with no formal lease. The sister moved in last summer, and her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her at the start of last year. Since then, she's been moping, bitter, and negative, stalking her ex and his new girlfriend who's pregnant. The author finally told her off, saying she needs to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is clearly affecting the household environment. She's been in a bad state for over a year, which is a long time. The author feels stuck because they can't remove her from the house. The sister's actions\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking ex's social media\u2014might be difficult to live with. The author's frustration is understandable. But was it wrong to tell her to move on?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the sister isn't processing her grief or moving forward. On the other hand, the sister might feel hurt by the author's bluntness. The author's approach was to tell her flat out to get over it, which could come off as dismissive. However, the sister's behavior has been a problem for a long time, and maybe the author felt they had to set some boundaries.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Maybe. The sister's emotional state might need support rather than criticism. The author's approach might have been too harsh, especially if they're not in a position to offer her emotional support or help. The sister might be struggling with unresolved grief, and the author's comment could have been a trigger or lack of empathy. However, considering the living situation and the ongoing negativity, the author might feel they have no other way to cope.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author's action was wrong. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive. The question is about emotional support in a family setting. It's possible that the author's frustration led them to say something unhelpful, but they might also be in a tough spot dealing with someone's long-term negativity.\n\nIn AITA threads, people often feel justified in their actions when the situation is affecting their well-being. The sister's behavior is impacting the author's living environment. However, the way the author addressed it could be the issue. Instead of telling her to \"get over it,\" maybe a more supportive approach could have been better. But the situation is complicated because the author isn't in a position to remove the sister from the household.\n\nI think the author's intention was to help, but the method was harsh. However, given the context of the sister's ongoing behavior, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But in terms of being supportive, maybe they are. It's a tricky balance. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because their approach was dismissive and potentially hurtful without offering support. The sister might still be grieving and needs empathy, not a blunt order to move on. So the answer would be A.\n"
