It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still clearly upset, hasn't dated anyone since, and is being very negative. The author is frustrated and told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been living with the author for about a year since the breakup. The breakup was a year ago, but the sister is still stuck in a negative state, which is affecting the household. The author, feeling trapped because they can't move out (since the parents own the house), might be at their wit's end. The sister's behavior includes stalking ex's social media, which is a red flag for not moving on. The author's outburst was a reaction to prolonged negativity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, telling someone to \"get over it\" can be dismissive and invalidating. It's possible that the sister is still grieving and needs support rather than criticism. The author might not be acknowledging the sister's emotional pain, which could make the situation worse. On the other hand, the sister's behavior is impacting the author's living situation. The author might feel they have a right to ask for a more positive environment, especially after such a long time.\n\nBut the key point here is the approach. The author's response was abrupt and perhaps not empathetic enough. Instead of giving advice to move on, maybe the author should have sought to understand or suggested professional help. Telling someone to \"get over it\" without providing support or acknowledging their feelings can indeed be hurtful and counterproductive. The sister's avoidance suggests that the author's words were damaging. Even if the sister hasn't made progress, the author's method of addressing it might be part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister's behavior is part of the issue, but the author's approach to handling it could be improved. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because their response was not supportive and could have been more compassionate, even if the sister's behavior was problematic. However, there's a middle ground where both parties have issues. But since the question is specifically about the author's action, the answer is more likely A.\n"
