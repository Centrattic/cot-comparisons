It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation is about telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still really affected, acting bitter and negative, and the author said she needed to move on. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister broke up over a year ago, but she's still moping around. She's avoiding dating, stalking her ex, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The author, living with her, finally tells her to move on, which caused the sister to avoid them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user says they think the author is wrong but wants my take. I need to evaluate the situation from different angles.\n\nOn one hand, it's been a year. The sister hasn't moved on and is affecting the household environment. The author is in a stressful living situation with no formal lease, so they can't just move out. They might be frustrated with the constant negativity and feel it's affecting their own well-being. It's reasonable for someone to feel the need to set boundaries when someone's behavior is impacting shared living spaces.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is going through a tough time. The breakup, miscarriage, and dealing with a new girlfriend of the ex are all significant stressors. The author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it\" and \"move on,\" which could come off as dismissive of her emotions. Even if the author is frustrated, the way they handled it might have been harsh. People grieve and heal at different rates, so a year might not be enough time for her. The author's comment could have been hurtful, even if their intention was to help.\n\nAlso, the sister is in a vulnerable state. Telling someone to just get over a significant loss without empathy or support can exacerbate feelings of isolation. The author might not have considered the sister's emotional state and instead acted out of their own stress from living with someone negative. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author suggests that the confrontation was damaging to their relationship.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between being supportive and enabling toxic behavior. If the sister's negativity is making the living environment unbearable, the author has a right to express that. But the method of communication matters. A more constructive approach might involve expressing concern, offering support, or suggesting professional help rather than a blunt demand to move on.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is understandable, their response was likely too harsh given the sister's ongoing emotional pain. The author could have handled it with more empathy and support. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
