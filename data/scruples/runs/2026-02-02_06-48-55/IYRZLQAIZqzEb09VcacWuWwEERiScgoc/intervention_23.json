It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't really kick her out. The sister's fianc\u00e9 broke up with her a year ago, and she's been really down, not dating anyone, bitter, and fixated on her ex and his new relationship. The author finally snapped and told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is living in a difficult situation where they can't leave and are dealing with a sister who's been depressed for a long time. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, which is a valid concern. The author might feel frustrated and overwhelmed, leading them to say something harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup that's been over a year is complicated. Grief and emotional processing take time, and it's possible the sister is still struggling. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though the sister's behavior is negative, the author's method of confrontation might not be the healthiest way to handle it. They might have approached it with impatience rather than empathy.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics. The author isn't a therapist, but the sister's actions are affecting their living situation. The author might not know how else to handle it. However, instead of snapping, maybe the author should have tried to support the sister or encourage professional help. \n\nIs it fair to say the author is in the wrong? Maybe. They didn't handle it with care, but the sister's behavior is also problematic. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach was harsh. So, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't handle it compassionately, but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the sister's behavior was unbearable and the author tried to help, maybe B. But given the context, the author's response was abrupt and might have been more about their own frustration than constructive help. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
