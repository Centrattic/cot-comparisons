It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister lives with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't move out. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been moping around, being negative, stalking her ex on social media, and is bitter because his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author told her to \"move the fuck on,\" and now the sister is avoiding them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. On one hand, it's been over a year, and the author might feel that the sister is stuck in the past, affecting the household environment. Maybe the author is frustrated with the sister's behavior and wants her to stop being negative. But on the other hand, the sister is dealing with a breakup and a miscarriage, which are significant emotional events. The author's approach of telling her to \"get over it\" might be dismissive of her feelings. People process grief and loss differently, and a year might not be enough time for everyone. Also, the sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) could be signs of deeper emotional distress that require empathy and support, not just a demand to move on. \n\nThe author might not have considered that the sister is still hurting and needs time. Telling someone to \"get over\" something can come off as insensitive, even if the intention is to help. Maybe the author should have approached the situation with more compassion, like suggesting professional help or offering support instead of just telling her to move on. \n\nBut then again, the author is living in the same house and dealing with the sister's negativity daily, which can be draining. The sister is avoiding the author, which might indicate that the author's approach was too harsh. However, the author isn't the one who caused the breakup, and they might feel they have to set boundaries. \n\nI think the key here is the tone and approach. Telling someone to \"get over it\" can be perceived as minimizing their pain. Even if the author is frustrated, a more supportive approach might have been better. So, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, not necessarily the content of the message. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the author's solution was maybe not the best. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the sister's emotions with enough empathy.\n"
