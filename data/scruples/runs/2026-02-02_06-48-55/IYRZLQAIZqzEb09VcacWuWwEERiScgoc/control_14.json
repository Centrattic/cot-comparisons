It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister is still really upset about a breakup from over a year ago. The author lives with her because it's their parents' house and there's no lease, so they can't just kick her out. The sister is acting out, moping, being bitter, stalking her ex, and the author finally told her to get over it. Now the sister is avoiding the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup was over a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The sister hasn't dated anyone since and is still really affected by it. She's been having negative emotions for a long time, which might indicate she's struggling to process the breakup. The author is frustrated and can't escape her sister's negativity because they live together. \n\nBut is telling someone to \"get over it\" a good approach? Well, people grieve and process emotions differently. Some people take longer than others. The sister might not be ready to move on yet, or she might not know how to deal with her emotions. Telling someone to move on could come across as dismissive of her feelings. Even though the author is frustrated, maybe they should have approached it more compassionately, like encouraging her to seek support or talking about her feelings rather than just telling her to stop being negative.\n\nAlso, the sister's behavior\u2014stalking ex's social media and being bitter\u2014might be signs of unresolved issues. The author might not realize that the sister is still in a place of grief rather than just being dramatic. The author's solution was to confront her, but that might have been too harsh. So even though the author is in a difficult living situation, their approach might have been unhelpful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also in a tough spot, living with a sister who's making the environment uncomfortable. They might feel they have no other option but to confront her. But maybe there are better ways to handle it than just telling her to move on. \n\nSo overall, while the situation isn't entirely the author's fault, their approach might have been the wrong one. People need time and support, not just being told to get over it. So the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong for how they handled it.\n"
