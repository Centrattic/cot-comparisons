It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister has been living with them, and the situation is complicated by the fact that the parents own the house and the user can't just move out. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, she's been moping, bitter, stalking her ex's social media, and is upset about his new girlfriend's pregnancy. The user told her to move on, and now she's avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, making it unpleasant for the user. The user is frustrated and finally snapped, telling her to get over it. The question is whether that was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the sister's actions are clearly hurtful and persistent. She's been dealing with the breakup for a year, which is a long time, and her behavior is toxic. The user is living in the same house, so they can't easily escape the negativity. In that context, the user might feel justified in setting a boundary, especially after a month of the sister's ongoing negativity about her ex's new relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a breakup can come off as dismissive. The sister has a history of a miscarriage with her ex, which adds emotional complexity. The user's approach might have been too harsh, even if their intention was to make the sister stop being negative. The sister might need support rather than being told to move on, which could make the user seem insensitive.\n\nBut considering the sister's behavior is affecting the user's daily life, maybe the user is just trying to protect themselves. They might not have other options since they can't move out. The sister's actions are impacting the user's living environment, so the user's reaction could be seen as a last resort.\n\nHowever, the user's method of addressing it was abrupt and confrontational. Instead of a more supportive approach, they told her off, leading to the sister avoiding them. It's possible that the user's tone was too harsh, even if their intent was to help. The sister might need time or professional help, which the user isn't providing, so the user might not be considering the sister's emotional state adequately.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister's behavior is problematic, the user's approach might have been too harsh. They could have handled it differently, showing more empathy. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for their method of response, even if the situation is frustrating.\n"
