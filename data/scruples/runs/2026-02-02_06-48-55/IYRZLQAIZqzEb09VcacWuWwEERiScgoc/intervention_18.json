It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is still upset, bitter, and moping around the house, which is causing tension. The author can't move out because their parents own the house and there's no lease, so they're trapped living with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's emotional state. She's been through a breakup, had a miscarriage, and is dealing with her ex's new relationship. That's a lot. The author, maybe frustrated by the constant negativity, tells her to \"move the fuck on,\" which led to the sister avoiding them. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the sister's situation is valid\u2014grieving a loss and dealing with a breakup can take time. The author might be trying to help by pushing her to move on, but the approach seems harsh. Saying someone needs to \"get over it\" can minimize their feelings. Even if the author is right that it's been over a year, the sister's emotional response might still be real and valid. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it could be more empathetic. \n\nAlso, living together without a lease adds pressure. The author might feel trapped by the situation, but their reaction might not be the most constructive. It's possible they didn't consider the sister's emotional needs and just wanted the negativity to stop. However, pushing someone to move on without support might not be helpful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's approach was probably too harsh, even if their intention was to help. They might not be at fault entirely, but their method of dealing with the situation is likely part of the problem. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the sister's emotions with the necessary empathy and understanding.\n"
