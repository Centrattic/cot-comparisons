It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sister who's been moping after a breakup over a year ago, and the author told her to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister lives with the author because they have no formal lease, and the author is stuck with her. The breakup was a year ago, but the sister is still very negative, stalking her ex, and now reacting to his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to get over it, leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I should analyze if that's the case. On one hand, the sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment. The author might feel overwhelmed and want her to stop being so negative. But on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" a past relationship, especially after a miscarriage, could be insensitive. \n\nEven if the sister hasn't moved on, the way the author expressed it might have been harsh. Phrases like \"move the fuck on\" can come off as dismissive of the sister's feelings. Grief and emotional processing vary for everyone, and a year might not be enough time for her, especially with the added trauma of a miscarriage. \n\nThe author's approach could have been more empathetic. Instead of bluntly telling her to get over it, maybe offering support or suggesting professional help would be better. The sister's reaction of avoidance suggests the author's words hurt her. \n\nSo, even though the author is frustrated, the method used might be wrong. The answer likely is A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The sister's behavior is indeed problematic, but the author's response could be the issue here.\n"
