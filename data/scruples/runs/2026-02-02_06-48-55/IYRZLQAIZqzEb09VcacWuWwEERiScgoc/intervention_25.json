It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is living with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been really negative ever since. She's been moping, bitter, stalking her ex's social media, and is upset that her ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to see both sides. On one hand, the sister is clearly still hurting and hasn't moved on, which is causing tension in the household. The author is frustrated and maybe felt they had to say something to improve the living situation. But on the other hand, telling someone to \"get over it\" might be dismissive of her feelings. It's possible the sister is suffering and the author's approach was harsh, even if intended to help. The sister might need support rather than judgment. Also, the author's method of confrontation could have been more empathetic. So, maybe the author is partly in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively. However, living together in a cramped space with someone so negative can be tough, so maybe the author's frustration is understandable. But the key issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. Since the sister's behavior is affecting the household, the author might have a valid concern, but their approach might have been wrong. So, I'm leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) because they dismissed their sister's feelings without showing support, which could have made things worse. But I'm not entirely sure because the sister's behavior was clearly affecting the author's life too. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A, but I need to make sure. The main question is whether the author was wrong. The sister's actions (moping, bitterness) are a problem, but the author's response was to tell her to get over it. It's possible that the author didn't offer support or understanding, just judgment. That's why the sister is avoiding them. So, the author's approach was flawed, making them at least partly in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
