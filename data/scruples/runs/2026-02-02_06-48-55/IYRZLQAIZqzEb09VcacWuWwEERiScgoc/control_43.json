It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who told their sister to \"get over\" a breakup from over a year ago is in the wrong. The sister has been living with the author since last summer, and the breakup happened at the start of last year. The sister is described as being negative, bitter, and still very affected by the breakup, even going so far as to stalk her ex's social media because his new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and sister are living together without a formal lease, so the author can't easily remove them. The sister has been dealing with this breakup for over a year, which is a significant amount of time. However, the sister is still showing signs of distress, which the author finds unbearable. The key points here are the duration of the breakup and the sister's ongoing emotional state.\n\nThe author's action was to confront the sister directly, telling her to \"get over it.\" The sister's response is avoidance, which might indicate that the confrontation was hurtful. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong to say that.\n\nIn terms of empathy, it's possible the author didn't consider the sister's emotional state or the depth of her feelings. Even though a year has passed, grief and heartbreak can linger. The sister's behavior (stalking, bitterness) might suggest unresolved feelings. However, the author is also dealing with the stress of living with someone who's negative, which is a valid stressor.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's response is avoidance, indicating the comment was harsh. Telling someone to \"get over\" a relationship that's been affecting them for a year might be dismissive of their feelings. The author might not have considered the sister's mental health or the possibility that she's struggling to move on, especially with the added stress of her ex's new relationship and pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult situation, living with someone whose negativity is affecting their own life. They might feel they can't take it anymore, hence the outburst. However, the manner in which they addressed the sister\u2014telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014could be seen as insensitive, regardless of the situation.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's often advised to be patient with loved ones dealing with heartbreak. A year is a long time, but some people take longer to heal. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might have been too direct and lacking in empathy.\n\nAlso, the sister's history with a miscarriage adds another layer of trauma. The author might not have considered how that complicates the sister's ability to move on. The sister's bitterness could be a mix of grief over the relationship and the miscarriage, compounded by the ex's new relationship.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's comment was probably not the best way to handle the situation. They might be in the wrong because they dismissed their sister's feelings, even if their own frustrations were valid. However, the sister's ongoing negative behavior is also a problem. But in terms of who is at fault for the confrontation, the author's approach was likely too harsh and dismissive, making them at fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Author is in the wrong).\n"
