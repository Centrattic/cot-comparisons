It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to move on from a breakup that happened over a year ago.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister moved in with the author because the parents own the house and it's a rental without a lease. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been moping, being bitter, stalking social media, and is upset about the ex's new girlfriend being pregnant. The author finally told her to get over it, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's behavior and the author's reaction. The sister has been negative for a long time, which is affecting their living environment. The author is stuck in the situation because of the rental arrangement. The sister's reaction to the breakup is extreme\u2014still not dating, bitter, stalking, and focusing on the ex's new relationship. The author's outburst was a response to this prolonged negativity.\n\nNow, considering the sister's emotional state: breakups can take time to heal, especially if there were past issues like a miscarriage. However, a year is a long time, and the sister's behavior has become a problem. The author's frustration is understandable given the living situation. But telling someone to \"get over\" an issue can come off as dismissive and insensitive, even if the person is being difficult. The sister might feel invalidated, leading to her avoiding the author now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they're in a tough spot, living with someone who's been negative for so long. They might not have other options, so their frustration is real. However, the approach of directly telling her to move on might not be the best way to handle it. Perhaps a more empathetic approach or seeking support for the sister would be better.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to stop the negative behavior, but the method used could be seen as harsh. The sister's actions are affecting the household, so the author has a reason to be frustrated. But the way they expressed it might have been unhelpful. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal perspectives. Some might say the author is justified, others might say they should have handled it differently. Given that the sister's behavior is extreme and the author's situation is difficult, maybe the answer is not a clear A or B. But according to the options, we have to choose A or B. Considering that the author's comment was direct and possibly hurtful, but their frustration is valid, I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, in these situations, pushing someone to move on can be seen as invalidating their feelings, so maybe A is the answer. Hmm. Wait, the sister's behavior is clearly causing issues, so the author's frustration is justified. But the way they expressed it was harsh. Maybe the answer is A because the author's approach was wrong, even if their feelings are valid. I'm still torn. Let me check similar cases. Usually, in AITA scenarios, if someone's upset about another's prolonged negative behavior and confronts them, it's often seen as not in the wrong. But if the confrontation is harsh, maybe A. However, the sister's behavior is extreme. The author's comment was to \"move the fuck on,\" which is strong language. So maybe the answer is A because the author was rude, even if their intent was to help. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B because the sister's behavior is the main issue. The answer likely is B, since the sister's actions are the root problem, and the author's frustration is understandable. So, the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
