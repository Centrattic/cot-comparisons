It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still grieving, has become negative, and the author feels trapped living with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is still dealing with a breakup from a year ago, which is a significant amount of time. The author is frustrated with her ongoing moping and bitterness, which affects their shared living environment. The author's intervention was direct and possibly harsh, telling the sister to \"move the fuck on,\" which might come across as dismissive.\n\nGrief and emotional healing vary per individual. While a year is a long time, some people take longer to process such events, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage involved. The sister's behavior\u2014stalking ex's social media, being bitter\u2014could indicate unresolved trauma or depression. The author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it,\" which might not be the most supportive way to handle someone's emotional struggles.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a difficult situation, living with someone they can't remove, leading to stress and possible resentment. They might feel that their sister is not taking responsibility for her emotional state, which affects their quality of life. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of empathy, advising someone to \"get over\" a breakup without understanding their deeper emotional issues might be invalidating. Supportive measures like encouragement to seek professional help or offering to listen could be more constructive. The author's blunt approach could have been hurtful, hence why the sister is avoiding them now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to be their sister's emotional support, especially if the living arrangement isn't ideal. But given the family relationship, there's an expectation of some level of support. The key issue is whether the author's response was inconsiderate of their sister's emotional state.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's approach was likely inconsiderate and dismissive, which could place them in the wrong. The sister's ongoing grief needs compassion, not a demand to move on. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
