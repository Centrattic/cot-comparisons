It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister to get over a year-old breakup is in the wrong. Let me consider the context.\n\nThe sister lives with the author, and there's no formal lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister's ex broke up with her over a year ago, and she's been moping, bitter, and negative since. She's been stalking him and his new girlfriend, who's pregnant, which makes her even more upset. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was probably to stop the sister's negativity from affecting the household. But the sister is dealing with grief and unresolved feelings. The breakup and miscarriage are significant events. The author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, but they might have been trying to help her move on. However, telling someone to \"get over it\" can minimize their feelings. It's possible the author didn't consider her emotional state or the reasons behind her bitterness. The sister might need support rather than criticism. The author's frustration is understandable, but the timing and tone might have been off. So, is the author at fault? Maybe partially, because they didn't approach it with empathy. But the sister's behavior is also affecting the author's living situation. It's a tough call. I think the author's action was hurtful, but the sister's behavior was also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they acted out of frustration and didn't consider her feelings properly, maybe they are partially at fault. So, leaning towards Answer A.\n"
