It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister lives with the author, and the situation is complicated because the parents own the house and there's no lease, so the author can't just kick her out. The sister has been moping around for a year, hasn't dated since, stalks her ex's social media, and is bitter. The author finally tells her to move on, and now she's avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's breakup was over a year ago, which is a long time. The sister hasn't moved on, is still very negative, and the author is frustrated. The author's message was direct and maybe harsh (\"move the fuck on\"), but maybe they were just trying to help. However, the sister is still dealing with the emotional aftermath, including a miscarriage and her ex moving on. The author might not fully understand the depth of her pain.\n\nOn one hand, the sister hasn't shown signs of moving on, so the author might feel that she needs to take responsibility for her own healing. The author's frustration is understandable, especially living together in a cramped space. The sister's behavior is affecting the household environment, making it stressful for the author.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone who's been grieving for a year to \"get over it\" might be dismissive of her feelings. Even though it's been a year, healing isn't linear. The miscarriage adds another layer of trauma. The author's approach was blunt, which could have come off as insensitive. The sister might need support rather than pressure to move on.\n\nThe key factors here are the sister's mental health and the author's approach. While the author might be trying to help, the method could be part of the problem. The sister might need therapy or time, not just a demand to move on. The author's frustration is valid, but their response might not be the best way to handle it. It's a balance between empathy and the need for a functional living situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their response was harsh and potentially invalidating. However, some might argue that the sister needs to take more responsibility. But in terms of the way the author handled it, they could have approached it more compassionately. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they dismissed their sister's ongoing emotional pain with a direct and harsh statement instead of offering support or understanding.\n"
