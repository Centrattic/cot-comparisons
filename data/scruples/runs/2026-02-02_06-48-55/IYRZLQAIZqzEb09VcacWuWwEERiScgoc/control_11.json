It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister to get over a breakup that happened over a year ago. The sister is still living with the author because the parents own the house and there's no formal lease. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, and she's been moping, being negative, stalking social media, and is bitter since finding out the ex's new girlfriend is pregnant. The author finally told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. Breakups can be really tough, especially if there were complications like a miscarriage mentioned here. The sister's grief might be prolonged, but a year is a long time. However, everyone processes grief differently. The author's frustration makes sense because living with someone who's constantly in a negative mood can be draining. The sister's behavior is affecting the author's living environment negatively.\n\nBut then again, telling someone to \"get over it\" can come off as dismissive. It might not acknowledge the sister's feelings and could make her feel unsupported. The author might not have considered alternative approaches, like encouraging her to seek counseling or offering emotional support instead of just telling her to move on. The sister's reaction of avoiding the author could indicate that she felt hurt or blamed, which the author might not have intended.\n\nThe key points are: the sister's ongoing emotional distress, the duration since the breakup, the impact on the household, and the author's approach to addressing the issue. The author's main concern is their own well-being due to the sister's negativity. However, the way they addressed it might not have been the most empathetic. While the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling frustrated, their method of handling it might be flawed. It's possible that the sister is still in a place where she needs support rather than direct confrontation. So, maybe the author should have approached it differently, but does that make them the asshole? Or is it a situation where both are dealing with their own challenges?\n\nIn terms of societal norms, pushing someone to move on from grief can be seen as insensitive. However, the author's living situation being affected is a valid concern. It's a tricky balance. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to their own emotional well-being, but their approach could have been better. However, depending on cultural or familial expectations, the sister might feel she's being judged. So, maybe it's a nuanced situation where both have partial responsibility. But according to the AITA framework, which often looks at whether the action was kind or considerate, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the sister's feelings with more compassion.\n"
