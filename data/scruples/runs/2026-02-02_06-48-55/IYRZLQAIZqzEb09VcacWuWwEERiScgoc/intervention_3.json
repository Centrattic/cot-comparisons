It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister being stuck living with her sibling and dealing with her sister's ongoing sadness from a breakup over a year ago. The sister mopes, is bitter, stalks her ex's new relationship, and the author told her to \"get over it,\" leading to the sister avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the sister's emotional state, the living situation, and the author's response. The sister's breakup was over a year ago, but she's still very affected, which is understandable. People grieve and process breakups at different rates. However, the sister's behavior\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking social media, and being negative\u2014has been going on for a while, and the author feels trapped living with her because there's no formal lease, so the sister can't be forced out.\n\nThe author's reaction was to tell the sister she needs to move on. The question is whether that's in the wrong. On one hand, the author is frustrated and living in a difficult environment. On the other hand, telling someone to \"get over\" something they've been struggling with might be dismissive of their feelings. Even though it's been a year, the sister's emotional pain might still be valid, especially considering the miscarriage mentioned. The author's approach might have been too harsh, not empathetic enough.\n\nBut the living situation complicates things. The author might feel they have no control, which adds stress. However, the way the author addressed the sister could be seen as invalidating her emotions. Suggesting that she just \"get over it\" without offering support or understanding might make the sister feel unsupported, hence why she's avoiding them now.\n\nI should consider if the author's intention was to help or just to end the negativity. If the author wanted to help, maybe a different approach, like encouraging therapy or suggesting ways to cope, would have been better. Being blunt might have worsened the situation. So, the author's approach is inconsiderate of the sister's ongoing emotional state, even if the frustration is understandable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
