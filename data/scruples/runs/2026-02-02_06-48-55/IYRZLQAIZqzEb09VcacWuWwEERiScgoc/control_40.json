It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister is still really upset about a breakup that happened over a year ago, and the author told her to \"get over it.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been living with the author, and there's no lease, so the author can't really remove her. The sister is described as being in a bad emotional state, moping, bitter, stalking her ex, and reacting negatively to his new girlfriend being pregnant. The author, frustrated, told her to move on, and now the sister is avoiding them.\n\nI should think about boundaries and emotional support here. The author is a sibling, so there's a family relationship. But the sister's behavior is affecting the household environment. The author might feel overwhelmed by the sister's negativity and is trying to set boundaries. However, telling someone to \"get over\" a long-term emotional issue might come off as dismissive. Even if the author is frustrated, the sister's feelings are valid, and the author's approach could be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister has been struggling for over a year, which is a long time, and the author is trying to encourage her to move forward. But the way it was said\u2014flat out telling her to \"move the fuck on\"\u2014might be harsh, especially if the sister isn't ready. The sister's avoidance suggests that the author's words hurt her feelings, even if the author's intention was to help. \n\nAlso, the sister's situation includes a miscarriage, which adds to the emotional complexity. The author might not fully understand the depth of her grief. In family dynamics, it's a delicate balance between supporting a relative and setting personal boundaries. The author might be in a tough spot, wanting to maintain their own peace but not handling it in the most supportive way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible that the author's approach was too direct and lacked empathy, even if the frustration is understandable. The sister's behavior is problematic, but the way the author addressed it might have been unhelpful. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not handling the situation more compassionately, even if the sister's actions were difficult. So the answer might be A, but I need to check again. Wait, the options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no. If the author's intention was to help but the method was harsh, maybe the answer is still A because the approach was wrong. Alternatively, if the sister's behavior was so toxic that the author had to set a boundary, maybe B. But usually, in these situations, advising someone to \"get over\" a breakup without support is seen as dismissive. So AITA often sides with the person who's being hurtful even if they're frustrated. So the answer might be A.\n"
