It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling their sister to get over a breakup from over a year ago. The sister is living with them, and there's no lease or agreement, so they can't move out. The sister's ex broke up with her a year ago, she hasn't dated since, is bitter, stalks his social media, and is upset because his new girlfriend is pregnant. The sister had a miscarriage when they were together. The author told her to move on, and now she's avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is living with the author, so there's a shared living environment. The author might be frustrated with the sister's behavior, especially since it's been a year and the sister is still in a bad state. The sister's actions\u2014moping, bitterness, stalking, and negativity\u2014are affecting the author's quality of life. The author's comment was direct and maybe harsh, but it's coming from a place of wanting things to change.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is dealing with a long-term emotional issue. A year is a significant time, but grief and heartbreak can linger. The fact that she had a miscarriage adds another layer of emotional pain. The author's approach was to tell her to \"get over it,\" which might come across as dismissive. People process emotions differently, and expecting someone to move on after a year, especially with added trauma like a miscarriage, might be unrealistic. The sister's reaction is a month of negativity after finding out about the ex's new girlfriend's pregnancy, which could be a fresh trigger.\n\nThe key points here are empathy versus frustration. The author might feel that the sister is holding on to past pain unnecessarily, but the sister is in emotional distress. The author's comment, while maybe well-intentioned, could have been insensitive. The sister might need support rather than a demand to move on. However, the author is also in a difficult position, living with someone who is affecting their environment negatively.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't address the sister's feelings with support and understanding. Instead, they told her to move on, which could be seen as invalidating her emotions. However, the sister's behavior is problematic, so the author's frustration is understandable. The balance here is tricky. The author's approach might not be the best, but the sister's actions are also not helping. The author might need to approach the situation with more empathy and perhaps seek ways to support the sister or set boundaries rather than demanding she get over it.\n"
