BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend didn't take the condoms out of his bag, which the author found suspicious. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in an exclusive relationship, so there's an expectation of monogamy. The boyfriend packed condoms, which could be for his own protection, but since they're exclusive, maybe it's unnecessary. The author saw them clearly and asked a question. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them and didn't remove them for the trip. Then he's acting upset, which the author finds confusing, especially since he was combining OTC meds, showing he's being deliberate with packing.\n\nThe author's question is a valid one because they're in a committed relationship. It's natural to feel uneasy if a partner has condoms in their bag when they're going away. The boyfriend's reaction of silence and acting like she ruined New Year's suggests he might be hiding something, but maybe he's just sensitive. But the author's suspicion isn't without basis. They didn't snoop, just noticed and asked. It's a reasonable question in an exclusive relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like not. They had a right to ask. The boyfriend's overreaction is more concerning. The answer should be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
