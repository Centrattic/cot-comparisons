He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking why their boyfriend packed condoms on a trip without them. The situation is that they\u2019re in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is going away for three weeks. The writer saw the condoms in his toiletries bag, which was clear and not hidden. They asked about it, and now the boyfriend is giving them the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. It's stated as exclusive, so neither partner should be having sex with others during the trip. The writer didn't snoop; they just saw the condoms because they were in a clear bag. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. The writer is left feeling suspicious because the boyfriend was meticulous about saving space by combining meds, so the condoms weren't an accident.\n\nNow, the key points here: the writer's question seems reasonable given the context. In an exclusive relationship, it's normal to have some level of curiosity or concern if the partner has condoms with them. The fact that the writer didn't invade privacy but noticed it because it was visible might justify the question. However, the boyfriend's reaction to the question is negative\u2014silent treatment and acting like the question ruined New Year's. That's a red flag. How someone reacts to their partner's question can be as important as the question itself. If the boyfriend is being defensive or dismissive, that could indicate issues in the relationship.\n\nBut is the writer in the wrong for asking? The question seems valid. It's about expressing concern in a committed relationship. The boyfriend's behavior of not removing the condoms might be careless, given the trip is without the partner. The writer's suspicion isn't unfounded because combining meds shows the boyfriend was trying to optimize space, but keeping condoms in the bag might be seen as unnecessary unless there's a reason. However, maybe the boyfriend just keeps them as a habit, but the writer is right to question it in an exclusive relationship.\n\nThe fact that the writer noticed the condoms without snoopiing is important. If they were visible, it's not like they went out of their way to find them. The boyfriend's response that he always keeps them there could be a red flag if he's not being truthful. But the writer's question is just a request for information, not an accusation. The boyfriend's reaction to silence and resentment suggests he's not handling the situation well, but the original question was justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The writer isn't in the wrong for asking a question that's natural in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's defensive reaction points more to his own issues rather than the writer's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
