BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip he's taking without her. The key points here are the context of the relationship, how the question was asked, and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the relationship is described as exclusive, so the author has every right to feel concerned about their partner's travel plans, especially if they're going to be away for three weeks. The boyfriend packed condoms in a clear bag, which the author saw without snoop, so the visibility might be a factor. The author's question was straightforward and based on their observation, which is a valid concern in an exclusive relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's response was that he always keeps condoms in his toiletries, but the author points out that he was trying to save space by combining OTC meds, implying he might not have included things by accident. The boyfriend's reaction of giving silent treatment and acting like the question ruined New Year's suggests he's taking it personally, which could indicate defensiveness or something more. \n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they asked a question upon seeing something they found suspicious. In an exclusive relationship, it's reasonable to question a partner's actions that might imply infidelity or lack of commitment. The author didn't snoop, just noticed the condoms in a visible bag. The boyfriend's reaction points to possible guilt or overreaction, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to ask. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like asking in a more private or non-confrontational way. But the question itself isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's response seems to be the bigger issue here. The author's suspicion is justified given the circumstances, especially since the boyfriend was trying to minimize space with other items, which might include removing unnecessary items. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the question was reasonable. Since the author saw the condoms in an exclusive relationship and asked, it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's reaction is more telling of his behavior than the author's question. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, but maybe there's room for better communication. However, the main issue is the boyfriend's response, not the question itself.\n"
