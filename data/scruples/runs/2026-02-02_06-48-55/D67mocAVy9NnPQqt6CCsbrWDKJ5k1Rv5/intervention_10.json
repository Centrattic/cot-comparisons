BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their boyfriend about packing condoms for a trip without them. The relationship is supposed to be exclusive. The boyfriend didn't hide the condoms; they were in a clear bag. The person didn't snoop, just asked a question. The boyfriend is now giving the silent treatment.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is trust. The boyfriend's argument might be that he always carries condoms, so it's not a big deal. But the person feels suspicious because they noticed he was optimizing space by combining meds, so they don't buy the \"accident\" line. \n\nIn an exclusive relationship, carrying condoms isn't necessarily a red flag by itself. Maybe he has a medical reason or just likes to be prepared. But the fact that they were visibly packed and not mentioned could hurt trust. The person's suspicion is valid if they feel insecure, but maybe the boyfriend didn't consider how it would look. \n\nThe person asking didn't snoop, just asked a question. They have a right to be concerned if they're in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's reaction of silence seems harsh for a legitimate question. So maybe the boyfriend is being unreasonable here. \n\nBut some might say the person overreacted. It's possible the boyfriend has a good reason, and the person is assuming the worst without evidence. However, in a trusting relationship, the boyfriend shouldn't have to defend something like that. \n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong because they're expressing concern about something that could be a breach of trust, even if it's not proven. The boyfriend's reaction is part of the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
