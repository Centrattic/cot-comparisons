He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip without her, and she found condoms in his clearly visible toiletries bag. She asked him why they were there, and he said he always keeps them there and didn't take them out for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, and she's wondering if she was wrong to be suspicious.\n\nFirst, in an exclusive relationship, both partners should have mutual trust and understanding. The key here is whether the author had a right to ask about the condoms. The story mentions that the condoms were in a clear Ziploc bag of toiletries, so she didn't have to snoop\u2014she just saw them. She asked, and his response was that he always keeps them there. \n\nBut the boyfriend had previously combined OTC meds to save space, which implies that he's organizing his bag intentionally. The author is now suspicious because he didn't remove the condoms, which might seem odd if he's in an exclusive relationship. However, keeping condoms in a toiletries bag could be for various reasons\u2014maybe he's used to having them there, or he's prepared in case of emergencies, even if it's an exclusive relationship. \n\nNow, the boyfriend is mad and giving her the silent treatment. The question is whether the author overstepped by asking. In an exclusive relationship, there's an expectation that neither partner would need to use condoms. So the presence of condoms could be a red flag. But the boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them. The author's suspicion is based on the inconsistency: if he always keeps them, why not take them out for this trip? Especially since he's making other efforts to save space. \n\nThe author's action was to ask, which is a reasonable response to something that seems contradictory. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests that maybe he didn't want to address the issue, perhaps because he's hiding something. The problem isn't necessarily the question itself but the underlying issue of trust. If the author already had doubts, the condoms could be a catalyst for deeper problems in the relationship. \n\nBut the author didn't snoop or accuse; she just asked. In that sense, she's not in the wrong for expressing her concern. However, the boyfriend's behavior (silent treatment) might indicate he's defensive or hiding something. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's question was reasonable given the context. The boyfriend's response might be an overreaction, and his behavior (not removing condoms despite other space-saving measures) could be suspicious. The author isn't in the wrong for being concerned, but there might be underlying issues in the relationship that need addressing. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
