BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip he's taking without them. The boyfriend is giving them the silent treatment now. \n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive, so condoms being packed could be a concern. The author saw them in a clear bag and asked, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend said he always keeps them there and didn't take them out for the trip. But the author is suspicious because he also combined OTC meds to save space, implying he's intentional about packing.\n\nHmm. So, in an exclusive relationship, condoms shouldn't be a big deal unless there's a reason to believe he's being unfaithful. But the boyfriend's response is that he always has them. Maybe he uses them for protection against STIs or just for other reasons. However, the author's suspicion is valid because if the relationship is exclusive, why pack them? Maybe the boyfriend isn't being honest.\n\nBut the author didn't snoop, just saw them in a clear bag. Asking a question isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of silence might be because he's defensive, perhaps hiding something. But the author's right to question is understandable. So, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship is exclusive, the boyfriend might be in the wrong for not being transparent. But the author's approach was direct and not accusatory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend has a legitimate reason, but the author's suspicion is reasonable. The key here is that in an exclusive relationship, unexpected items like condoms could be a red flag. The author's action was to ask, which is appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic, but the question is whether the author is wrong for being suspicious. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be concerned in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's behavior (silent treatment) is more concerning. The author's question was a reasonable response to something that could indicate a breach of trust.\n"
