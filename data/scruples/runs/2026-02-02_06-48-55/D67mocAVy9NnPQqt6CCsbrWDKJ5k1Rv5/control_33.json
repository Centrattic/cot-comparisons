BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without her. \n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive, so there's an expectation of fidelity. The boyfriend is going on a three-week trip without the writer. The condoms were in a clear Ziploc bag in his toiletries, so they were visible. The writer didn't snoop, just asked why he had them. The boyfriend responded that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment.\n\nI need to consider if the writer overstepped. Since the condoms were visible, the writer had a reason to ask. In an exclusive relationship, bringing up the presence of condoms isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh because the writer didn't violate any trust by looking; they just noticed and asked. The boyfriend's explanation might not be satisfying, but the act of asking isn't wrong. The silent treatment is a red flag, indicating maybe he's being defensive or hiding something, but that doesn't make the writer wrong for voicing their concern.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the writer should have trusted the boyfriend's explanation without pushing further. However, since the trip is three weeks long and they're in an exclusive relationship, the presence of condoms could raise valid questions. The boyfriend's behavior of combining meds to save space shows he's intentional about packing, so the condoms being there intentionally could be concerning. The writer's suspicion is normal in this context.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). Asking a question about something that's visible and relevant to the relationship isn't a transgression. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic if he's avoiding the issue.\n"
