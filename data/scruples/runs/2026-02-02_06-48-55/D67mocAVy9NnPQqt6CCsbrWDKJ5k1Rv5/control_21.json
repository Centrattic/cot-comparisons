BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip. The author saw the condoms in a visible part of his toiletries bag and asked about them. The boyfriend responded that he always has them and didn't take them out. Now he's giving the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship. They're in an exclusive relationship, so the boyfriend shouldn't be planning to be intimate with someone else. The author's question is about why he has condoms when he's not bringing the author along. That seems reasonable because in an exclusive relationship, there's no expectation of using protection for another partner. So the author is justified in being concerned or suspicious.\n\nThe boyfriend's response that he \"always keeps them\" might not be a good enough reason. If they're exclusive, he shouldn't need to have condoms for other partners. The fact that he didn't remove them for the trip could be a red flag, especially if the author's question is about trust. The author's reaction is a valid expression of their feelings and concerns. The boyfriend's silent treatment suggests he's upset, but maybe because he feels accused. However, the author isn't wrong for having that question. Trust is important in a relationship, and the author is within their rights to voice their suspicion. The key point is whether the question was justified given the exclusivity. Since the author is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author's concern is reasonable in an exclusive relationship.\n"
