BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without her. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip. The author saw the condoms in a visible Ziploc bag and asked about them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them and didn't take them out for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In an exclusive relationship, both partners are expected to be faithful. The boyfriend is going away for three weeks. The author found condoms in his luggage, which is a reasonable cause for suspicion. The boyfriend's explanation is that he always carries them, but the author is not convinced because he also combined OTC meds to save space, implying that he's being deliberate with what he packs. The author's suspicion might be valid because even though the boyfriend said it's routine, the situation is different now since he's traveling without her. The presence of condoms during a trip where he's alone could be a red flag. \n\nHowever, the author didn't snoop or invade privacy. They saw the condoms in an open bag. The boyfriend's reaction to the question with the silent treatment might indicate that he's hiding something. The author's question was reasonable given the context. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has a legitimate reason, like using them for safe sex in case of emergencies or other non-romantic reasons. But in an exclusive relationship, why would he need them unless he's planning to be with someone else? The author's suspicion isn't unfounded. The boyfriend's behavior of not removing them for the trip might suggest he's going to use them. \n\nSo, the author's action of asking the question is justified. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from guilt or defensiveness. The author isn't wrong for being concerned in an exclusive relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
