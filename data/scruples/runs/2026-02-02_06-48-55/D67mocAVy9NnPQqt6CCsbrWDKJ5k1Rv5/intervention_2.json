BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for questioning her boyfriend about the condoms in his luggage. They're in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend didn't take the condoms out for the trip. The author noticed them without snooping and asked, then got the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a relationship. In an exclusive relationship, both partners are expected to be faithful. The boyfriend had condoms in his bag, which the author found suspicious. But he said he always keeps them in his toiletries bag and didn't remove them for the trip. \n\nNow, the author's action was to ask a question after seeing something she found odd. She didn't snoop, just noticed them. His reaction was to give the silent treatment, which seems harsh. The key points are: 1) The author's right to question something that raises suspicion in an exclusive context. 2) The boyfriend's behavior of combining meds to save space suggests he's intentional about what he packs. 3) The boyfriend's response was dismissive and punishing.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. The author's suspicion is valid because in an exclusive relationship, having condoms could imply a lack of fidelity. However, the boyfriend's explanation is that he always carries them. But why keep them if the relationship is exclusive? Maybe for protection against STIs, but that's a personal choice. The author's concern is about infidelity, which is a valid reason to question.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to the silent treatment is problematic. If he's committed, he should address her concerns instead of isolating her. The author isn't wrong for feeling suspicious and wanting clarity. So, she's not in the wrong for asking. The answer should be B.\n"
