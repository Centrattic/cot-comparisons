BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms in his luggage. The situation is that the boyfriend is going on a trip without her, and she saw the condoms in his bag, which was plain to see. She asked him, and he said he always keeps them there. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. It's an exclusive relationship, so the boyfriend is supposed to be faithful. The author's suspicion is understandable because the trip is without her, and condoms are there. But the boyfriend claims it's routine, not for the trip. However, the author noticed he's meticulous about packing, combining meds to save space. So, maybe the condoms were there for a reason, but the boyfriend's response didn't satisfy her.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't snoop; the condoms were visible. She asked a question, which is a reasonable reaction. The boyfriend's response was dismissive, and he's punishing her for asking. That might indicate he's hiding something. If the relationship is exclusive, he should have a clear explanation. If he's not willing to provide enough reassurance, that's on him.\n\nBut some might say the author is being distrustful without evidence. However, in a relationship, partners should be open about such things. Since the trip is with someone else, even if he's not cheating, the presence of condoms might be a red flag. The author's right to ask is valid. The boyfriend's silent treatment is a poor response. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asking, but maybe the boyfriend is for not being transparent or for reacting negatively. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
