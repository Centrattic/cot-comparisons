BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend left the condoms in a clear bag, so the author saw them and asked. The boyfriend got upset and gave the silent treatment. The author is wondering if they were wrong to be suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is exclusive, so the boyfriend shouldn't be planning to be with someone else. But the author saw the condoms in plain sight, which might be a normal thing for him to carry. Maybe he's a responsible person and always carries them just in case, even though it's an exclusive relationship. However, the author's reaction was to question it, leading to conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them and didn't take them out. The author found it suspicious because he was meticulous about packing, combining meds to save space. So why would he leave condoms in there unless there's a reason? But the boyfriend's behavior now is giving the silent treatment, which is a red flag. It's possible he feels accused or that the question was a trust issue.\n\nIn an exclusive relationship, it's normal to carry condoms for safe sex, even if you're in a monogamous relationship. However, the author's suspicion might be based on a lack of trust. The key is whether the question was justified. Since the condoms were visible and the author asked without snooping, maybe they had a right to be curious. But the boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the question was accusatory. \n\nThe author's action was a question, not an accusation. The boyfriend's response being the silent treatment suggests he's upset, possibly overreacting. The author's suspicion could be reasonable if there were previous issues, but there's no mention of that here. Without more context, it's hard to say. However, in an exclusive relationship, carrying condoms is not inherently wrong. So maybe the author is not in the wrong for asking. But if the boyfriend is open about his packing habits, maybe the author overreacted. Alternatively, the boyfriend's silence indicates he's not handling the situation well, which could mean the author isn't at fault.\n\nSo the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they saw something public and asked a question based on their observations. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here, not the question itself.\n"
