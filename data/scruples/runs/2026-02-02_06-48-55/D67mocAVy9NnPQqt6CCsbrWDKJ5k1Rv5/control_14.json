BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms. They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a trip without her and she saw the condoms in his bag, which was open and visible. She asked about them, and he said he always keeps them in his toiletries. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is exclusive, so bringing condoms on a trip without the partner might raise suspicions. The key points here are that she didn't snoop, just saw them because they were in a clear bag. She asked a question because she's in an exclusive relationship, which makes sense. The boyfriend's reaction is the silent treatment, which seems harsh. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Condoms can be for health reasons, like preventing STIs, even in a monogamous relationship. However, the boyfriend's history of combining OTC meds shows he's intentional about what he packs. So keeping condoms in there might be intentional, but why bring them if it's exclusive?\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The main issue is her suspicion and the boyfriend's reaction. In an exclusive relationship, bringing condoms might imply infidelity, but the boyfriend claims it's routine. If he's always done that, maybe it's a red flag. But maybe he's just prepared. However, the fact that he's acting hostile for her asking suggests he might be hiding something. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She asked a question because of her trust issues, which are understandable. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. Since she didn't snoop, just asked a question, I think she's justified in her suspicion. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). But maybe some would argue that trust is important and she shouldn't question him. However, in an exclusive relationship, bringing condoms could be a breach of trust. But the boyfriend's behavior post-question is worse. So B makes sense.\n"
