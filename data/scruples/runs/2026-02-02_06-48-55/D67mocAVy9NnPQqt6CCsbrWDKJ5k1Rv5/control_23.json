BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip he's taking without her. They're in an exclusive relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author saw the condoms in a clear bag while the boyfriend was packing. They didn't snoop; it was visible. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. But the author is suspicious because he also combined meds to save space, suggesting he's intentional about what he packs. Now, the boyfriend is giving the silent treatment, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, in an exclusive relationship, the expectation is monogamy. If the author is jealous or concerned, that's a normal reaction. The boyfriend's answer that he \"always keeps them in there\" might not be convincing, especially if the author has noticed his meticulous packing habits. The author's question was a natural response to seeing something that could imply infidelity. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the author didn't snoop, just asked a question. The boyfriend's reaction of silent treatment after a legitimate question might indicate that he felt accused without being given a chance to explain. However, the author's suspicion is reasonable given the context of an exclusive relationship. \n\nThe key points are: visibility of the condoms, the author's right to question since it's an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend's reaction. The boyfriend's answer might not have been satisfactory, leading to the author's suspicion. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's question is valid, and the boyfriend's defensiveness might be the real issue here. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to feel suspicious and ask for clarification, especially in an exclusive relationship.\n"
