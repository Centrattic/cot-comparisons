BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without her.\n\nFirst, the context: they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip. The writer saw the condoms in his bag, which was open and not hidden. They asked why he brought them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, implying she ruined the night.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the question was justified. The writer is in an exclusive relationship, so bringing condoms on a trip could be seen as inappropriate. The boyfriend's history of being meticulous (like combining pills) suggests that he's intentional with his packing. The writer's suspicion is natural because in an exclusive relationship, condoms shouldn't be necessary unless he's planning to be with someone else. \n\nThe key points: the condoms were visible, she didn't snoop, she asked a legitimate question. The boyfriend's reaction seems over the top. His behavior of giving silent treatment and acting like she ruined the night might indicate he's hiding something. The writer's suspicion is reasonable given the exclusivity of their relationship. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
