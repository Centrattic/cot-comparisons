He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she's in an exclusive relationship and saw condoms in her boyfriend's bag for a trip he's taking without her. She asked about it, he said he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment because of her question.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if her reaction is justified. The key points here are that the relationship is exclusive, and the condoms were in plain sight. She didn't snoop; she just saw them while he was packing. Her question was about why they were there. Condoms can be for multiple reasons\u2014maybe he uses them for health, or for other partners if it's not exclusive. But the relationship is supposed to be exclusive.\n\nShe's suspicious because he didn't remove them for the trip. He says he always keeps them in the toiletries bag, which makes her wonder if maybe he's not being honest. But maybe he's just being prepared for safe sex, even if they're exclusive. For example, if he's going to be around others, but that's part of the exclusivity. Wait, in an exclusive relationship, you're supposed to be the only sexual partner. So why would he need condoms? Maybe for other purposes, like health issues, or maybe he's just used to carrying them.\n\nBut the problem here is that she's asking a question that seems reasonable in an exclusive relationship. If someone is in an exclusive relationship and sees condoms in their partner's bag for a trip they're going on alone, it's natural to feel concerned. The boyfriend's response that he always keeps them there might not satisfy her because she's questioning the necessity in an exclusive context.\n\nIs she overstepping? Well, she didn't snoop. She saw them in plain view and asked. That's normal. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014silent treatment\u2014is a bit harsh. If he's not doing anything wrong, why is he upset? Maybe he is hiding something, or maybe he just doesn't want to discuss it. But his reaction of silence could be a sign that he's being defensive.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he has legitimate reasons. For example, using condoms for other purposes, like for health reasons (some people take them for IUDs or other medical reasons), or maybe he's just used to carrying them. But in an exclusive relationship, the expectation is that you're the only one. So if he's carrying them, it's a red flag. Unless there's another explanation.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's in an exclusive relationship and has a valid reason to be concerned, then she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of silent treatment is more indicative of his possible defensiveness or guilt. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a cultural or personal aspect I'm missing. In some contexts, carrying condoms is normal regardless of relationship status, so she might be overreacting. But given the exclusivity, her suspicion is understandable. So I think the answer is B.\n"
