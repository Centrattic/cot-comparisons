      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms in his luggage. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a trip without her and packed condoms that were clearly visible. The author asks why he did that. He says it's something he always does and didn't remove for the trip. Now, he's giving her the silent treatment and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about trust and communication. The author saw the condoms, which were not hidden, and asked a question. In an exclusive relationship, the presence of condoms might raise concerns about infidelity. The boyfriend's response is that he always carries them, which could mean he uses them for protection in case of one-night stands or maybe just for medical reasons, like STI prevention. However, the author doesn't seem satisfied with the answer and is now feeling suspicious.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions. If they're in an exclusive relationship, the boyfriend should be aware that bringing condoms on a trip without his partner might seem suspicious. Even if he's always carried them, the context of the trip (going away without her) adds to the concern. The author's question is a natural reaction to that. \n\nBut the boyfriend's response is that he just keeps them there and didn't remove them. That might not be a very reassuring answer. If he's in an exclusive relationship, he might need to be more considerate of how his actions are perceived. If he truly has a good reason for carrying condoms (like STI protection), he should explain that clearly. But if he's not providing a satisfactory answer and is instead acting cold, that could indicate something else.\n\nThe author's suspicion is a valid reaction. She's in a committed relationship and has a right to feel concerned about his behavior. The fact that he's giving her the silent treatment suggests that he's upset with her for questioning him, which might not be fair. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable discussing such issues without fear of retaliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't snoop or invade his privacy. She saw the condoms by accident and asked a question. That's not inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own behavior being questioned rather than the question itself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for asking about the condoms. The boyfriend's response and the silent treatment are problematic. The answer should be B (No).\n"
