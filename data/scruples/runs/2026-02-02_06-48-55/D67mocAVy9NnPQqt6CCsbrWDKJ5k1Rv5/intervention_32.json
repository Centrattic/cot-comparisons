He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who asked about the condoms in their boyfriend's bag is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple is in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend is going on a three-week trip without her, and she found condoms in his toiletries bag, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author saw the condoms clearly and asked about them. The boyfriend said he always keeps them there and didn't bother removing them for the trip. The key points here are that the author didn't snoop; she saw them while he was packing. She questioned it because she's in an exclusive relationship, so she might feel that condoms shouldn't be necessary if he's not planning to be with someone else. \n\nBut in an exclusive relationship, some people still carry condoms for protection against STIs, even if they're faithful. So maybe the boyfriend's reasoning is about health precautions rather than infidelity. The author's suspicion might be valid, but the question is whether her reaction was wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's response was to give the silent treatment and act like she ruined their New Year's. That's a significant reaction. The author's intent was to seek clarity because she was concerned about his actions. If the relationship is exclusive, she has a right to be curious about why he's carrying condoms. However, if the boyfriend's explanation is legitimate (health reasons), then her suspicion might be unfounded. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The author didn't invade privacy; she noticed something that made her uneasy in a situation where she might expect otherwise. The boyfriend's reaction to the question could indicate he feels accused, but maybe the author's suspicion is justified if there's a history of distrust or other red flags. However, in the absence of prior issues, the boyfriend's explanation might be valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship is based on trust, then maybe the author overreacted. But if the boyfriend's behavior is suspicious (like combining meds to save space, which might indicate planning for something else), maybe her suspicion is reasonable. However, the act of asking a question isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for asking a question that arises from being in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's response is more problematic. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
