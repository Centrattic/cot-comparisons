He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend packing condoms for a trip without the girlfriend and the GF is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're in an exclusive relationship, so condoms shouldn't be necessary if he's only with her. The GF saw the condoms in a visible place and asked about them. The BF's response was that he always keeps them in his toiletries bag. But the GF is suspicious because he's also combining OTC meds to save space, implying he's intentional about packing. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, which suggests he's defensive.\n\nThe key points here: the GF didn't snoop, she saw them openly. She's asking a legitimate question because it's unexpected in an exclusive relationship. The BF's reaction is to ignore her, which might indicate he's hiding something. But maybe he has a legitimate reason, like using them for other purposes (though in an exclusive relationship, that's not typical). \n\nIs the GF wrong for being suspicious? Well, in an exclusive relationship, bringing condoms on a trip without the partner could be a red flag. However, sometimes people pack them for safety or other reasons. But the BF's response of \"always\" doesn't address why he's doing it now. The GF's concern is valid because it's unexpected. The BF's silent treatment is a sign of conflict avoidance, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, the GF isn't wrong for asking. She's within her right to question something that seems inconsistent with their relationship status. The BF's reaction might indicate he's not being transparent. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
