He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend packing condoms for a trip without his girlfriend, and she asked why he did that. The boyfriend is now giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They are in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The girlfriend found the condoms in his toiletries bag, which was clearly visible. She asked about them, and he said he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's acting upset with her.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. Let me break it down.\n\nIn an exclusive relationship, trust is important. The girlfriend's reaction is based on suspicion. She didn't snoop; she saw the condoms in a visible spot. Her question was straightforward. The boyfriend's response was that he always carries them, which might be a red flag if that's not their usual practice. However, the boyfriend is now acting distant, which could indicate he's being defensive or maybe hiding something.\n\nBut from the girlfriend's perspective, it's reasonable to feel concerned. If he's always carried condoms, why would she be upset? But if he's going on a trip where he might meet other people, even in a monogamous relationship, having condoms could imply a breach of trust. However, maybe he's just being prepared, or he uses them for other reasons (like for other people's safety, even in a monogamous relationship, but that's less common).\n\nThe key points here are: the question was innocent and direct, she didn't invade his privacy, and his reaction is overly harsh. If he's not open about his reasons, maybe there's an issue with his side. But if he's always carried condoms and she's just now getting suspicious, maybe she's overreacting.\n\nHowever, in a new relationship (8 months), trust is still being built. The boyfriend's behavior of combining meds to save space shows he's trying to be efficient, so maybe keeping condoms wasn't an accident. But he's acting like she's wrong for asking, which could indicate he's hiding something. \n\nSo, whether she's in the wrong depends on the boyfriend's reasons. If he's being truthful and there's no issue, then she's overstepping. But if he's lying about his reasons, then she has a right to be suspicious. Since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, and based on the information given, she asked a valid question. The fact that he's now punishing her for asking suggests he might have a reason to hide. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for expressing suspicion. So answer B.\n"
