      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip abroad and invited the author last night. He was packing, and the condoms were in a clear Ziploc bag of toiletries. The author saw them and asked why he had them. The boyfriend said he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now, he's giving the author the silent treatment.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're at fault for being suspicious. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, the key points: The relationship is exclusive, so condoms shouldn't be necessary. The author didn't snoop; they were visible in the toiletries bag. The boyfriend's justification is that he always keeps them there. However, in an exclusive relationship, that might still raise red flags. The author's suspicion is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) seems harsh, but maybe he feels accused. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for asking? They had a right to question something that seems out of place in an exclusive relationship. But maybe the boyfriend's explanation is valid\u2014he might have a medical reason or just keeps them for emergencies. The author not trusting the explanation could be an issue. But the question is about the act of asking, not the continued suspicion. The author saw something that shouldn't be there and asked. The boyfriend's response was that it's a habit, but that doesn't necessarily explain why it's in his toiletries bag, which is personal. The author's suspicion isn't unreasonable. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. \n\nBut maybe the author overreacted. If the boyfriend has a legitimate reason, the author's suspicion without further evidence could be a problem. However, in an exclusive relationship, the presence of condoms is suspicious. So the author's question is valid. The boyfriend's explanation is weak, and the author's suspicion is justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asking. Answer B.\n"
