He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip without her, and she noticed condoms in his toiletries bag, which he says are always there. He's now giving her the silent treatment for asking about them.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author saw the condoms plain in his bag, didn't snoop. She asked, he answered it's his usual practice. But she's still suspicious and upset. The boyfriend is acting like she ruined New Year's Eve by asking. \n\nIs her reaction justified? Well, in an exclusive relationship, bringing condoms on a trip isn't necessarily suspicious. People might carry them for various reasons\u2014maybe he's in a new place, maybe it's just habit. But the author's suspicion could stem from insecurity or past issues. However, the boyfriend's response that he always keeps them there might be valid. \n\nBut the author's main issue is that his behavior (combining meds to save space) shows he's intentional about packing, so why the condoms? Maybe he's planning to use them, but in an exclusive relationship, that's not okay. But does that make the author wrong for being suspicious?\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) suggests he felt accused without cause. The author didn't snoop, but the act of asking might have made him feel like she's distrustful. However, in an exclusive relationship, having condoms can be a red flag. But maybe the author overreacted without more evidence. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the relationship is exclusive, condoms shouldn't be necessary. His presence of condoms could imply infidelity. But the author didn't accuse him directly, just asked. Maybe she's right to be concerned. But the way he responded (silent treatment) is problematic. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author might be right to feel suspicious, but maybe she should have handled it differently. However, since she didn't snoop and just asked, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue she's overreacting. Hmm.\n"
