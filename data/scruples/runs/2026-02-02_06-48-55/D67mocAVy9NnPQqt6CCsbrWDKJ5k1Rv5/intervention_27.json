BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is going away for three weeks. The key points here are the context of the relationship, the visibility of the condoms, and the boyfriend's response.\n\nFirst, the author found the condoms in a clear Ziploc bag, which is part of the toiletries. They didn't snoop, just saw it while the boyfriend was packing. The boyfriend's reaction was to give the silent treatment, suggesting he felt accused. The author's concern is understandable because the condoms were packed for a trip he's taking without her, which could raise suspicion in an exclusive relationship.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's explanation: he says he always keeps condoms in his toiletries and didn't remove them for this trip. That might be a legitimate reason if they're part of his regular travel items. However, the author's reaction is based on the situation where they're in an exclusive relationship, and the condoms are for a trip where he's alone. The author's suspicion is a natural response given the circumstances.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't accuse him of infidelity directly; they just asked a question upon seeing something that could be concerning. The boyfriend's response was to act like the question ruined their time together. The author's question stems from wanting to understand and ensure trust in the relationship. It's reasonable to ask about something that seems out of place in the context of an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's defensiveness might be an issue here, as he's treating a question as an accusation without addressing the underlying concern.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has a valid reason for always carrying condoms, like for emergencies or general preparedness. But since the trip is without the author, the author's concern is valid. The fact that the boyfriend combined medications to save space shows he's being deliberate with his packing, so the condoms being there might seem intentional. However, the author isn't in the wrong for questioning something that seems suspicious in that context.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a justified expression of their feelings of insecurity or need for reassurance in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction might be more of the problem here. Therefore, the answer is likely B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
