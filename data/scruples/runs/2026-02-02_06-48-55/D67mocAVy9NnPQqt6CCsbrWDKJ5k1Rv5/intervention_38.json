He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. The situation is in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is acting upset after the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in an exclusive, not open, relationship. So condoms might be part of regular use for safe sex, even in a monogamous relationship. The girl saw the condoms in a visible, clear bag and asked. She didn't snoop, just asked. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there. But now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nThe key points here are: the relationship is exclusive, the condoms were visible, and the boyfriend didn't hide them. The girl's reaction is based on suspicion, but maybe she's overthinking. On the other hand, maybe the boyfriend should have considered her feelings by not keeping them in a visible place if he thought it might cause concern. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's intention was to ask a question because she noticed something that made her curious. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme (silent treatment), which might indicate he's sensitive or hiding something. However, in an exclusive relationship, condoms can be for protection against STIs, not necessarily infidelity. So the author's suspicion might be unfounded. \n\nBut is it wrong to ask? If the condoms were in a visible place, maybe the boyfriend should have considered that. However, the author didn't snoop, just asked. The boyfriend's reaction to the question as if it ruined their time together is problematic. But the question itself\u2014asking why he packed condoms\u2014is a reasonable one in an exclusive relationship, right? Maybe the author is justified in feeling suspicious if he's acting defensive. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's response is extreme, but the author's action was to ask a question. Depending on the context, maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. However, sometimes people might have reasons for carrying condoms in a visible way, so the author's suspicion might be unwarranted. \n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the question was reasonable and if the boyfriend's reaction is valid. Since the relationship is exclusive, the author might be wrong to assume the worst without more evidence. But she had a right to ask. So, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning, but the question itself isn't inherently wrong. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
