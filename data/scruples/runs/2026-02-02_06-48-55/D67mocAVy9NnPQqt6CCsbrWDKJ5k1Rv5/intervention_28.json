BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their boyfriend about finding condoms in his luggage for a trip he's taking without her. They're in an exclusive relationship, so the boyfriend packing condoms could be a red flag.\n\nFirst, the author didn't snoop\u2014they saw the condoms in a visible toiletry bag. That's not invading privacy. The boyfriend's response was that he always has them there. But the author is suspicious because he's combining meds to save space, implying he's deliberate about what he packs. So the author's question seems reasonable. \n\nBut the boyfriend is giving the silent treatment now. The author is being accused of ruining New Year's. The key points here are the context of the relationship being exclusive, the visibility of the condoms, and the boyfriend's behavior. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. However, when there's a breach of exclusivity, like packing condoms for a trip without the partner, it's natural to feel hurt and question his actions. The author's reaction is about seeking reassurance and clarity. The boyfriend's silent treatment suggests he might be defensive or hiding something. \n\nThe author's suspicion is based on observable evidence and the context of an exclusive relationship. It's reasonable to be concerned if a partner has condoms readily accessible during a trip without them. The boyfriend's justification that he \"always\" has them might not be convincing if the situation is unusual. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They had a right to ask, especially given the potential implications of an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
