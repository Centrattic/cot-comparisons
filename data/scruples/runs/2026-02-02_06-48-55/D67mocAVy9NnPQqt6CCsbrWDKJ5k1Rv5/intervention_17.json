BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is going away for three weeks. The author saw the condoms in a clear bag and asked about them, and now the boyfriend is giving them the silent treatment.\n\nHmm, so first, the author didn't snoop; they saw the condoms because they were in a visible Ziploc bag. The boyfriend says he always keeps them in there and didn't remove them for the trip. The author is feeling suspicious, but the boyfriend is upset. \n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. In an exclusive relationship, both partners should be able to discuss such things openly. The author's action of asking a question isn't inherently wrong. It's reasonable to want reassurance and to address concerns. However, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014silent treatment\u2014might indicate that he's sensitive about this topic or maybe has a history of trust issues. \n\nBut wait, maybe the boyfriend's justification is that he always carries condoms for other purposes, like protection or just in case. If the author is questioning that, maybe they're not trusting the boyfriend's word. But in an exclusive relationship, there shouldn't be a need for condoms unless there's a medical reason. However, some people might carry them for other reasons, like visiting a friend who isn't in the relationship, or maybe just as a precaution.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's suspicion is a valid emotional response. They might feel jealous or insecure. It's important for couples to communicate about these things. The boyfriend's response of silent treatment isn't healthy, but the initial question from the author isn't necessarily wrong. They are expressing their feelings and seeking clarity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They have a right to ask about something that's causing them concern. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
