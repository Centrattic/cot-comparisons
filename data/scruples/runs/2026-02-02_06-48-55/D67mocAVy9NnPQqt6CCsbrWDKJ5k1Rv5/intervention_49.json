He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms in his bag. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is going on a trip without her. She saw the condoms in a visible Ziploc bag of toiletries and asked him about it. He said he always keeps them there and didn't take them out for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They\u2019ve been exclusive for 8 months, so trust should be high. However, the boyfriend is going on a trip without her, which might naturally raise some insecurities. The author didn\u2019t snoop; she saw the condoms in a clear bag. That\u2019s important because she\u2019s not violating his privacy by going through his things. She asked a question, which is a reasonable reaction when something seems out of place. \n\nThe boyfriend\u2019s response was that he always keeps them there. That\u2019s a possible red flag because if they\u2019re in the toiletries bag, maybe he\u2019s trying to be discreet. The author points out that he\u2019s being careful with space, combining meds, so it\u2019s unlikely that the condoms were an accident. His reaction\u2014silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year\u2019s\u2014suggests he might feel accused or that his privacy was invaded. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, she had a legitimate reason to ask. In an exclusive relationship, condoms might not be necessary unless he\u2019s planning to have sex with someone else. However, some people might carry them for other reasons, like protection against STIs even in a monogamous relationship. But the fact that he didn\u2019t remove them for the trip could imply he\u2019s expecting to use them, which the author would find suspicious. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn\u2019t snoop, asked a question upon seeing something visible, and the boyfriend\u2019s reaction seems defensive. The boyfriend\u2019s behavior (silent treatment) might indicate he has something to hide. However, the author could have handled it differently, maybe by discussing her feelings instead of just asking. But given the context, her suspicion is understandable. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), then she\u2019s overstepping. If B (no), then she has a right to be concerned. Considering the situation, I think the answer is B because she\u2019s expressing valid concerns without invading privacy. The boyfriend\u2019s reaction is the issue, not her question.\n"
