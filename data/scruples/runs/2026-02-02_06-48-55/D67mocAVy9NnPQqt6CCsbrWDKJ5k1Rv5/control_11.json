He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and her boyfriend are in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. He's going on a trip without her for three weeks, and she sees condoms in his bag. She asks why he has them, and he says he always keeps them there. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're in an exclusive relationship, so having condoms might be normal for some couples. But the author is suspicious because he didn't remove them for this trip, even though he was trying to save space by combining meds. She didn't snoop; she just saw them in a visible bag. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to give the silent treatment, which is a bit harsh. Maybe she had a right to ask because of the exclusivity. But maybe she overreacted? The key points here are about trust and communication. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable discussing such things. If the author is feeling insecure, that's valid, but asking a question shouldn't be a reason for the silent treatment. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel that the question is accusatory. Maybe he didn't think the condoms were an issue, so her asking made him feel mistrusted. But the fact that he didn't remove them for a trip without her could make her question his actions. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for asking. It's reasonable to question something that seems contradictory to the exclusivity of the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
