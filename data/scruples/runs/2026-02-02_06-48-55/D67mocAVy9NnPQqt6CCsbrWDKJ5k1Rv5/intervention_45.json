BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for questioning her boyfriend about packing condoms on a trip without her. They\u2019re in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going abroad for three weeks and invited her the night before. She saw the condoms in his toiletries bag, which was a clear Ziploc, so she didn't have to snoop. She asked him, and he said he always keeps them there. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the wrong thing by asking. Let's break it down. First, in an exclusive relationship, trust is key. The boyfriend didn't mention that he carries condoms, which might be a red flag. But the author saw them and asked a question, which is reasonable. She's allowed to be curious, especially since they're a couple. However, the boyfriend's reaction is concerning. He's acting like she betrayed him by asking, which might indicate he's hiding something. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he just has them for safety, and she's being overly suspicious. But the fact that he's combining meds to save space suggests he's intentional about what he packs. So maybe the condoms are intentional. If that's the case, the author has a right to be concerned. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't snoop. She saw them while he was packing and asked a question. That's a legitimate action. The boyfriend's response is problematic. If he's in an exclusive relationship, he shouldn't be carrying condoms unless there's something to hide. But maybe he's using them for protection, not infidelity. However, the author's suspicion is valid given the circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's within her rights to question something that seems inconsistent with their relationship status. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of his potential wrongdoing rather than her asking. Trust issues are on his side if he's not being transparent.\n"
