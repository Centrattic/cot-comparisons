BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend didn't remove the condoms from his toiletries bag. The author found them plain sight and asked, then the boyfriend gave the response that he always carries them and didn't take them out. Now the boyfriend is giving the silent treatment and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't snoop or open anything, just saw the condoms in a clear bag. In an exclusive relationship, one might expect the partner to be more careful about including something that could be perceived as suspicious. The boyfriend's response about always keeping them might not be convincing, especially since he made other efforts to save space, like combining meds. That could imply he's being careless with the condoms being visible. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction to asking a question is causing tension. Maybe the boyfriend felt accused, even if the question wasn't confrontational. The author's suspicion is natural, but maybe they overreacted. However, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014silent treatment\u2014seems harsh for just asking a question. \n\nI should weigh the expectations in a relationship. Trust is important, but so is communication. If the boyfriend is in an exclusive relationship, packing condoms could be for safety, but the author's concern is valid because of the visibility. The boyfriend's response doesn't address the author's feelings of being excluded or the potential for mistrust. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's question was justified and if the boyfriend's reaction was appropriate. The author didn't do anything wrong by asking. The boyfriend's actions (leaving condoms in a visible bag) might have been careless, leading to the author's suspicion. The silent treatment after a legitimate question might mean the boyfriend is at fault for not communicating better. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for questioning something that could affect their trust. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
