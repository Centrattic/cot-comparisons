BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend packing condoms and the girlfriend asking why.\n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive, so condoms shouldn't be necessary if he's only with her. The girlfriend saw them in a clear bag without snooping. She asked him, which is a reasonable question. His response was that he always keeps them there. But she points out he's meticulous about packing, like combining meds, so it's not an accident. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, implying she ruined New Year's.\n\nI need to determine if she's in the wrong. In an exclusive relationship, bringing condoms on a trip without the partner might raise suspicions. Even if he has them for general safety, in a monogamous relationship, it's not typical. Her asking isn't a violation of trust; she's expressing concern. His reaction seems overly harsh. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
