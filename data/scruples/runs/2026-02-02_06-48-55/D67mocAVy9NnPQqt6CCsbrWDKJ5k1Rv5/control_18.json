He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a girlfriend, asked her boyfriend why he had condoms in his packed bag for a trip he's taking without her. They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. She saw the condoms in a clear Ziploc bag with toiletries, didn't snoop, just asked. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's by asking.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. She saw the condoms and asked. The question is about whether her reaction was justified. The key points here are the exclusivity of the relationship, the visibility of the condoms, and the boyfriend's response.\n\nIn an exclusive relationship, both parties are expected to be faithful. The boyfriend is going on a trip without her. The condoms being clearly visible might make the author suspicious. Asking why they're there isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of silent treatment seems harsh, but maybe there's more to the story.\n\nThe author didn't snoop; she saw them by accident. Her asking is a natural response to her suspicion. The boyfriend's justification is that he always carries them. However, if the relationship is exclusive, keeping condoms in the bag for a trip without the partner could be seen as problematic. But maybe he has a reason, like for safe sex in case of one-night stands if he's in a new place. However, in an exclusive relationship, that shouldn't be necessary.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he might feel accused without cause. But the author's suspicion is reasonable given the circumstances. The problem is whether her question was a legitimate concern or overstepping. Since she didn't snoop and the condoms were visible, asking isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's response of silent treatment might indicate he's hiding something, but that's not clear. The author's right to feel suspicious isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
