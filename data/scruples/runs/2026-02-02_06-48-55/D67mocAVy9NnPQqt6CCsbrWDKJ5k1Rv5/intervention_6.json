      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about packing condoms. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a trip without her and she saw the condoms in his bag, which were clearly visible, and asked him. He said he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are: exclusive relationship, condoms found in plain sight, the question asked, and his reaction. The author didn't snoop, just saw them while he was packing. She asked a question, which is a natural reaction if she's concerned. But he's acting upset and giving her the silent treatment.\n\nWhy would he be upset? Maybe he's annoyed she questioned him, even if he's truthful. Or maybe he feels she's being distrustful. The author is suspicious because he packed condoms, which in an exclusive relationship might seem odd. However, he claims he always keeps them, so maybe they're for him? Like for personal health reasons, or maybe for a medical condition? Condoms can be used for other things besides sex, but in most cases, they're for protection. Since it's an exclusive relationship, if he's planning on having sex with someone else, that would be a breach. But he's not taking her with him, so maybe he's meeting someone else there?\n\nBut the author didn't snoop. She saw them in plain sight. Asking a question is reasonable. The issue is his reaction. If he's being silent and acting like she ruined the night, maybe he's being defensive. But why? If he's innocent, why the reaction? Or maybe he's upset because she's questioning his actions without evidence.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. In an exclusive relationship, both parties are expected to be faithful. If the boyfriend is taking condoms, even if he's not cheating, maybe he's preparing for something that's not within the relationship. But without more context, it's hard to say. The author's action was to ask a question, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate if he's truthful. On the other hand, if the author is being controlling or not trusting without cause, that's an issue.\n\nBut since the relationship is only 8 months, maybe trust is still building. The author's suspicion is justified if she feels insecure. But is it wrong to question him? If he's honest and there's no infidelity, then the author is overreacting. However, the boyfriend's response of silence is also poor. The problem might be communication. The author isn't in the wrong for asking, but maybe she's not in the right for being suspicious without evidence. However, the boyfriend's behavior is worse because he's not communicating.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the question was justified. Since the condoms were in plain sight, asking is okay. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
