He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. They're in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is acting like the question ruined their New Year's Eve. \n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip abroad and didn't invite the author. When the author saw the condoms in his toiletries bag, which was clearly visible and not hidden, they asked about it. The boyfriend responded that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving them the silent treatment.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to ask. Let's break it down. In an exclusive relationship, it's reasonable to expect that both partners are faithful. If one partner is going on a trip without the other and has condoms packed, that could raise red flags. The author didn't snoop; they just saw them in a visible area. The boyfriend's response suggests he didn't think it was a big deal, but the author feels suspicious.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe. But in an exclusive relationship, it's natural to be concerned if there's any indication that the partner might engage in non-exclusive behavior. The fact that the boyfriend didn't remove the condoms for the trip might be a sign he doesn't think it's an issue. However, the author has a right to feel insecure here. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) seems harsh. The author's question was reasonable given the circumstances. They didn't accuse him of cheating, just asked why he had them. The boyfriend's response that he always keeps them there might be true, but maybe he should have considered how that would make his partner feel when he's going away for three weeks. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for being concerned. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
