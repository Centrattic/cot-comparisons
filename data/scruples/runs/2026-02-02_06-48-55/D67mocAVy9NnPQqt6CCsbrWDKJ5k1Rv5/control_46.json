BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend packing condoms for a trip without the other person, and the author is upset about it. They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months.\n\nFirst, the author saw the condoms in a clear bag, didn't snoop, just asked. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them and didn't remove them. The author is suspicious and now the boyfriend is giving the silent treatment. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider the context of an exclusive relationship. Condoms could be for protection against STIs or for other reasons. The author's reaction is based on suspicion, which is understandable in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's behavior of combining meds to save space might indicate he's being intentional about what he packs. So, if he packs condoms, even as part of his routine, the author has a right to be concerned. \n\nHowever, the author didn't snoop, just asked a question. The boyfriend's reaction being the silent treatment and acting like the author ruined the night might indicate he's overreacting. The problem here is the boyfriend's response, not necessarily the author's question. In a healthy relationship, partners should feel comfortable discussing such things. The author's suspicion isn't baseless; it's a valid concern in an exclusive relationship. So the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend has a legitimate reason for keeping condoms, like for emergencies or if he's meeting others, even if the relationship is exclusive. But the author has every right to ask. The wrong here might be on the boyfriend for not being open and for the silent treatment, not the author for asking. So the answer is B (No).\n"
