BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive, so both are supposed to be faithful. The boyfriend is going on a three-week trip without the author. The author found condoms in his toiletry bag, which was a clear Ziploc, so they were visible without snooping. The boyfriend's response was that he always carries them and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment, making the author feel guilty for asking.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're at fault for being suspicious. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants to know the community's take. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions: they didn't snoop, just asked a question upon seeing something that made them uneasy. The boyfriend's response was dismissive, and now he's acting upset. The author's suspicion is understandable in an exclusive relationship. However, maybe the author could have approached it differently? But the boyfriend's behavior of combining meds to save space suggests he's intentional about packing, so the condoms not being an accident might be valid. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author had the right to ask. Since the condoms were visible and not hidden, the author is within their right to question it. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic. The author isn't wrong for expressing concern in a situation that naturally causes jealousy. So I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
