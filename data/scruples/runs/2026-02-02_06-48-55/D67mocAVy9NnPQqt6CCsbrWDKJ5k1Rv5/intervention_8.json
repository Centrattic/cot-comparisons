BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The couple is in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going abroad for three weeks, and the author saw the condoms in his pack, which were in a clear Ziploc bag of toiletries. The author didn't snoop, just saw them and asked. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship context. They're in an exclusive relationship. Condoms in a partner's bag might raise questions because they're a contraceptive. If the relationship is monogamous, why would he need them? The author's suspicion is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) could indicate he's defensive or hiding something. The author didn't snoop, they just noticed and asked a question. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them, but that seems a bit odd. Maybe he uses them for other purposes, like protection against STIs even in an exclusive relationship, or maybe he's not using them appropriately. Alternatively, maybe he's not being truthful. \n\nThe author's actions: asking a question because they noticed something they found suspicious. The boyfriend's reaction is harsh. The author isn't wrong for being concerned. In an exclusive relationship, expecting trust is normal, but so is transparency. If the boyfriend is packing condoms, it's reasonable to question it. The author didn't overstep by not snooping, just asking. The boyfriend's response might be a red flag if he's defensive without a valid reason. \n\nPossible angles: Trust is important in relationships. The boyfriend's behavior might be the issue here if he's evasive. The author's question is valid. If the boyfriend truly didn't have a good reason, maybe the author is justified in their suspicion. But if the boyfriend has a legitimate reason, the author might need to consider that. However, the boyfriend's behavior after being asked (silent treatment) is problematic. \n\nThe options are A (author is at fault) or B (not). The user initially thought the author is at fault but wants to know. But in my analysis, the author is questioning something that's reasonable in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's response and reaction may indicate the problem is on his side. So the answer might be B.\n"
