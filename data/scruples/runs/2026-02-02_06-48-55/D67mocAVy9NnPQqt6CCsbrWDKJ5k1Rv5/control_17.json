He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend packing condoms for a trip without the author, and the author asking why they were there. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is acting upset about the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author acted appropriately. The key points are: the author saw the condoms in a visible place, didn't snoop, and asked a question. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them, but the author is suspicious and now he's giving the silent treatment. \n\nIn an exclusive relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and privacy. However, condoms being present in a visible part of the packing could reasonably raise questions, especially for someone who is in a committed relationship. The author didn't go out of their way to look through private items; they just noticed something that was in plain sight. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh. If he truly has a good reason for keeping condoms, he should be able to explain it without resentment. His silent treatment might indicate that he's defensive or hiding something, which could be a problem in the relationship. \n\nThe author's suspicion might be justified if there are other signs of dishonesty, like combining medications to save space (which could mean he's being careful about what he brings). The fact that the author is left feeling suspicious and upset is a red flag. Trust is important in a relationship, and the boyfriend's nonchalant response without addressing the concern might be the real issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking the question. They had a legitimate reason to be concerned given the exclusivity of the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of a problem in the relationship rather than the author's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
