BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. The situation is an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip. The author found the condoms in a visible Ziploc bag in his toiletries and asked about them. The boyfriend says he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, considering the context of an exclusive relationship, the expectation is monogamy. The condoms being there could be for any number of reasons, like health precautions or just being prepared. The author didn't snoop, just noticed them in a visible place. The boyfriend's response was that it's a habit, but the author feels suspicious. Is the author overreacting?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's question was about something that might seem relevant to trust. However, the boyfriend's reaction to the question being the silent treatment might indicate he's hiding something or is sensitive about it. But the author didn't accuse him of cheating; they just asked about the condoms. The boyfriend's behavior after the question is concerning. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for asking? If the boyfriend is in an exclusive relationship, he should be open to such questions. The author has a right to be curious, especially if the trip is long. However, maybe the author should check their own assumptions instead of immediately suspecting infidelity. But in an exclusive relationship, condoms might still be necessary for other reasons. \n\nThe key here is whether the question was respectful and not an accusation. The author didn't snoop, just asked upon noticing. The boyfriend's reaction is more telling\u2014maybe he's acting defensive. But the author's suspicion might be justified if they have prior reasons to doubt, but the post mentions no history. \n\nSo, the author's action isn't wrong, but maybe their suspicion is unwarranted without more context. However, the boyfriend's behavior (silent treatment) is a bigger red flag. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have a right to ask, and the boyfriend's response is the issue.\n"
