      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them.\n\nFirst, the situation: they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip abroad. The author sees the condoms in his bag, clearly visible, and asks about them. The boyfriend says he always keeps them there and didn't take them out for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author didn't snoop; the condoms were in plain sight. They asked a question because they noticed something that made them question their relationship's exclusivity. The boyfriend's defense is that he always carries condoms, but in an exclusive relationship, that could be a red flag. The boyfriend is upset and acting like the question ruined their night. \n\nIn an exclusive relationship, both parties are supposed to be faithful. If the boyfriend is carrying condoms on a trip without the author, especially when the author is left behind, it's natural for the author to feel suspicious. The boyfriend's response that he \"always\" keeps them there might not address the specific situation of this trip. Even if he usually carries them, on this trip he's going alone, so the author's suspicion is reasonable. \n\nThe author's action was to ask a question after seeing something that made them uncomfortable. They didn't accuse him of cheating but asked for an explanation. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be deflection or avoiding the issue, which could indicate he's hiding something. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author's question shows they're trying to communicate their concerns. The boyfriend's silence and anger might be a sign of guilt or insecurity, but either way, the author isn't wrong for expressing their discomfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to question the presence of condoms in an exclusive relationship context, and their reaction is a normal response to perceived infidelity. The boyfriend's behavior since then suggests he's not handling the situation well, but the initial question was justified.\n"
