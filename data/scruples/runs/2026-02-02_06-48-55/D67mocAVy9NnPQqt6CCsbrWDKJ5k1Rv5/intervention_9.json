BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person and their boyfriend are in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend is going on a three-week trip alone, and the author saw condoms in his toiletries bag. They asked why he packed them, and he said he always keeps them there and didn't take them out for the trip. Now, he's giving the author the silent treatment and seems upset about the question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. They're exclusive, so the boyfriend isn't supposed to be with anyone else. The author is asking a question that's understandable given the exclusivity. But the boyfriend's reaction is to give the silent treatment, which is a red flag. The author didn't snoop; the condoms were visible, and they asked a straightforward question. The boyfriend's response that he always keeps them there might not be convincing, especially since he's combining OTC meds to save space, implying he's being intentional about what he packs. If he truly didn't plan to use them, why keep them in the toiletries? That could raise suspicions.\n\nThe author's suspicion might be justified because in an exclusive relationship, there's an expectation of monogamy. If the boyfriend isn't using condoms with the author, then carrying them might suggest he's planning to have sex with someone else. However, the boyfriend could have a legitimate reason, like for health reasons or for someone else in his life. But in an exclusive relationship, the expectation is that he wouldn't be with someone else. The author's reaction is a reasonable response to a potential breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction to the question being harsh suggests he might be defensive or hiding something. \n\nOn the other hand, sometimes people carry condoms for various reasons unrelated to infidelity. Maybe he uses them for protection against STIs even in a monogamous relationship. Or he might carry them for emergency contraception. But given the context of an exclusive relationship and the trip being without the author, the author's suspicion is valid. The boyfriend's non-answer or vague answer might not be sufficient. The author isn't wrong to question it since trust is a cornerstone of any relationship. The boyfriend's punishment (silent treatment) for asking a question is also problematic because open communication is important.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asking the question. The wrong here might be more on the boyfriend's side for not being upfront and for reacting negatively. The author's suspicion is a reasonable response given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
