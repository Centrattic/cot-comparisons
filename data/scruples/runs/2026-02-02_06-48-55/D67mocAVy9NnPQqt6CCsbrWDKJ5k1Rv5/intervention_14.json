BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months, and the boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip. The author found the condoms in a clear bag, didn't snoop, and asked about them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship. They're exclusive, so any mention of condoms might raise suspicion. The author saw them by accident, not through snooping, which is important. The boyfriend's explanation is that he always carries them, but the author is skeptical because he also combined meds to save space. The author's suspicion is valid because in an exclusive relationship, one might expect the partner to not carry condoms for others. However, the boyfriend's reaction to the question is the silent treatment, which is a red flag.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: 1) Did the author overreact? 2) Was the question inappropriate? 3) Is the boyfriend's reaction worse?\n\nThe author's action was to ask a question upon noticing something that could imply infidelity. Since they're in an exclusive relationship, the author has a right to be concerned. The boyfriend's behavior of keeping condoms in his toiletries bag might be habitual, but the author's reaction is based on trust issues. However, the author didn't accuse him of cheating, just asked why he had them. The boyfriend's response that he always has them might be the truth, but the author's suspicion is reasonable given the situation. \n\nThe boyfriend's silent treatment and acting like the author ruined New Year's suggests he's defensive or possibly hiding something. But the author's question was not an accusation. They didn't make a scene, just asked a legitimate question upon noticing something. So the author isn't in the wrong for expressing concern. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic here.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's question is a valid attempt to address a concern. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively (silent treatment) is a bigger issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asking the question, even if their suspicion might be unfounded. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here.\n"
