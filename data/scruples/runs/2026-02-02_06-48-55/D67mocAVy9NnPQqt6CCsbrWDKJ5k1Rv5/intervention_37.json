      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their boyfriend about finding condoms in his packed bag for a trip he's taking without her. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is going abroad for three weeks.\n\nFirst, the situation: the condoms were in a clear Ziploc bag as part of his toiletries, so the author saw them without snooping. She asked him about it, and he said he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nHmm. In an exclusive relationship, trust is key. The boyfriend's response is that he always carries condoms, which could be for his own peace of mind or maybe for unexpected situations. But the fact that he packed them for a trip without his girlfriend might raise suspicions. The author's question is whether it's reasonable to be suspicious.\n\nThe author didn't snoop; she saw them in plain sight. So, it's not like she went out of her way to look. Asking about it is a natural reaction. The boyfriend's reaction to the silent treatment suggests he might be defensive or hiding something. Maybe he's upset because the question made him feel accused. \n\nBut the core issue is about trust. If the relationship is exclusive, the boyfriend has no need to carry condoms for another partner. However, people might carry them for various reasons\u2014maybe he's a health-conscious person, or he uses them for protection against STIs regardless. But in an exclusive relationship, that might not be necessary. However, some people might still carry them as a precaution.\n\nThe author's suspicion is based on the fact that he's going on a trip without her and packed condoms, which is understandable. But the boyfriend's explanation is that it's a habit. The problem is whether that explanation is sufficient. If the author finds it hard to trust his explanation, especially given that he combined medications to save space (which shows he's intentional about packing), her suspicion is reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) indicates he's upset about the question, which might imply he feels accused. However, if the author is in an exclusive relationship and her partner is carrying condoms, even if it's a habit, it's natural to question it. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for asking. The boyfriend's reaction might be more indicative of something else. The author's suspicion isn't unfounded given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
