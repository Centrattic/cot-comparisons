BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is going away for three weeks. The main points are: the author found the condoms in a clear bag, didn't snoop, just asked about them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them, and now he's giving the silent treatment. The author is wondering if they're at fault for being suspicious.\n\nHmm. First, in an exclusive relationship, you'd expect both partners to be faithful. So the author's concern is understandable. The condoms being in a clear bag might make them feel like their partner isn't being honest. But the boyfriend says he always packs them. Maybe he uses them for protection from STIs, or maybe he's preparing for an emergency. But the author is worried because they noticed he combined meds to save space, implying he's intentional about packing. \n\nIs the author wrong for questioning this? Well, they didn't snoop, just asked a question. But maybe the boyfriend feels that the question is an accusation. The author's suspicion might stem from insecurity or jealousy. However, in a healthy relationship, open communication is key. The author is expressing a concern, but the boyfriend's reaction is a silent treatment, which isn't healthy either. \n\nBut is the author at fault? If the boyfriend is in an exclusive relationship, packing condoms could be for various reasons. The author's question is valid because trust is important. However, if the author is constantly suspicious without evidence, that could be a problem. But given the context of an exclusive relationship and the boyfriend going away for three weeks, the author has a right to feel concerned. The boyfriend's response of silent treatment might indicate he's hiding something or is upset about the question. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong for asking. They're seeking clarity in a situation that's a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior post-question might be more problematic. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
