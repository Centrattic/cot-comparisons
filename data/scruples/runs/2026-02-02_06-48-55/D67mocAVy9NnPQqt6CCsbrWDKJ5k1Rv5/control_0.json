      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months, and the boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip abroad. The author saw the condoms in his bag, which were clearly visible, and asked about them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's by asking. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is exclusive, so the boyfriend shouldn't be having sex with anyone else. The condoms are in his toiletries bag, which is part of his packing. The author didn't snoop; she just saw them while he was packing. Her question seems reasonable because in an exclusive relationship, bringing condoms might be unnecessary or even suspicious. The boyfriend's reaction is to give her the silent treatment, which could indicate he's hiding something or maybe he's just defensive. \n\nBut in an exclusive relationship, bringing condoms might be a normal precaution for him, maybe for travel situations, or maybe he uses them for other reasons. However, since they're exclusive, he shouldn't need them for other encounters. The fact that he didn't take them out for the trip might make the author question why he's bringing them at all. \n\nThe key points here are: the author didn't invade his privacy, she saw something that raised a legitimate concern in an exclusive relationship. Asking a question about it isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be an overreaction if he's actually innocent, but if he's hiding something, the question is valid. \n\nIn many relationships, trust is essential. If the author feels the need to ask, maybe there's an underlying issue of trust or past issues. However, the situation is that she's asking a question she has a right to ask. The boyfriend's response might indicate he's sensitive about it, but that doesn't make her wrong for asking. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because asking a question about something that seems to contradict the exclusivity of the relationship is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of his own behavior rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
