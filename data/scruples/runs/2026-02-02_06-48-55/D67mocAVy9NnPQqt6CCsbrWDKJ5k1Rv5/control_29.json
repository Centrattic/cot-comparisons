BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without her. They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months.\n\nFirst, the author saw the condoms in a clear bag, not hiding. They didn't snoop, just noticed. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them and didn't remove them for the trip. The author is suspicious and now the boyfriend is giving the silent treatment, which upset them.\n\nIn an exclusive relationship, it's normal to expect trust. But the author's reaction might be based on insecurity. The boyfriend says he always packs them, but maybe the author is worried he's being unfaithful. However, the boyfriend didn't deny the question; he explained. The author's suspicion could be valid if there are other signs, but in this case, the only issue is the condoms. The boyfriend combining meds shows he's trying to save space, which is a separate thing. The author's question was natural, and the boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) seems harsh. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asking. They're in a relationship where trust is important. If the boyfriend is upset because of the question, maybe he's being defensive. The author's suspicion is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
