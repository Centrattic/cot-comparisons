He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their boyfriend about finding condoms in his luggage for a trip he's taking without her. They're in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is acting upset, giving the silent treatment. \n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend didn't take the condoms out, even though he was going on a trip without her. The user's question is valid because they're in an exclusive relationship. Condoms are typically used for protection, but in an exclusive relationship, maybe for health reasons? Or maybe it's just a habit. But since the trip is without her, the presence of condoms might raise suspicion.\n\nThe user didn't snoop, they just saw them plain in his toiletries bag. They asked a question, which is a reasonable reaction. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there, but the user is now suspicious. The user's reasoning is that he was trying to save space by combining meds, so it's not an accident. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is key. If the user feels the need to check for condoms, maybe there's underlying trust issues. But the boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) seems excessive. However, maybe the user's action was a breach of privacy? They saw it without being asked, but it was in plain sight. \n\nSo, is the user wrong? Well, asking a question when they found something in plain sight isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top. But maybe the user's suspicion is justified given the context. However, in a healthy relationship, communication is important. The user's action was a valid concern, but maybe the way they brought it up could have been better? Or maybe not. Since the condoms were in plain view, the question seems reasonable. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to be concerned in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's response is more out of line. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
