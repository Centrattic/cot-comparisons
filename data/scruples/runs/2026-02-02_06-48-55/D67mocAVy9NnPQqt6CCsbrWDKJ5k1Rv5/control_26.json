BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for questioning their boyfriend about packing condoms on a trip where he's going without her. They're in an exclusive relationship, so that's important. The boyfriend didn't take the condoms out, and the author feels suspicious because he's been combining meds to save space, implying he's intentional about what he packs.\n\nFirst, the author saw the condoms in plain view, so they didn't have to snoop. That's a point in their favor because they didn't invade privacy. The question is about whether the author overreacted. In an exclusive relationship, trust is key. The boyfriend's response was that he always carries them, but the author is now upset. The boyfriend is giving the silent treatment, which suggests he feels accused without cause.\n\nBut the author's suspicion isn't baseless. The fact that he combined meds shows he's being intentional about saving space, so the condoms not being removed seems odd. The author has a right to feel concerned because in an exclusive relationship, the expectation is monogamy. The boyfriend's lack of explanation beyond \"I always have them\" might not be satisfying enough. The author isn't wrong to question it; it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's reaction of silent treatment could indicate he's defensive or guilty, which puts the onus on him to address the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being suspicious.\n"
