      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's in an exclusive relationship, found condoms in their boyfriend's bag when he was packing for a trip. They asked why they were there, and the boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them in his toiletries bag and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is exclusive, so the boyfriend should be expected to not bring condoms for other reasons. Condoms are typically for sexual activity, which in an exclusive relationship is between the partners. However, sometimes people might carry condoms for other reasons, like for protection against STIs even within a monogamous relationship, or maybe for someone else if the relationship isn't exclusive. But the user says it's exclusive.\n\nThe author saw the condoms because they were in a clear Ziploc bag, so she didn't have to snoop. She asked a question. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them in there. But the author points out that he was being very space-efficient, combining medications to save space, implying that keeping condoms in there wasn't accidental. This makes her suspicious.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is giving her the silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's by asking. The author is left wondering if she was wrong to be suspicious.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in an exclusive relationship, it's reasonable to question why your partner is carrying condoms if they're not there for you. The boyfriend's explanation might not be sufficient. However, the author didn't snoop; she saw them by accident. But the way she approached it might have been a problem? Or maybe not. Condoms are personal and can be a sensitive topic. Maybe she overreacted, or maybe he's hiding something. \n\nBut in terms of the question: is the author wrong for asking? In a healthy relationship, communication is key. If the author feels the need to ask, it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) suggests he might be hiding something. However, the author's suspicion is based on the situation. Since the relationship is exclusive, the existence of condoms could be a red flag. So, the author isn't wrong for being concerned. The boyfriend's reaction seems more problematic than the question itself. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
