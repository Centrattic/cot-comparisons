BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their boyfriend about finding condoms in his packed bag for a trip they're not going on together. The relationship is exclusive, and they've been together 8 months. The boyfriend didn't take the author on the trip, so they were spending their last night together. The author saw the condoms in a visible bag, didn't snoop, and asked about them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there, but didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment and the author is feeling suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Since it's exclusive, the boyfriend should be expected to not have any other sexual partners. The author's question seems reasonable because the condoms are for a trip he's taking without her. The boyfriend's response that he \"always\" keeps them there might not be convincing, especially since he made other packing choices to save space. That inconsistency could raise suspicion. The author's right to be concerned is valid because it's a sign of potential infidelity, which is a breach of trust in an exclusive relationship.\n\nHowever, the way the author approached the situation might matter. They saw the condoms openly and asked directly. There's no indication of prying or snooping. The boyfriend's reaction being the silent treatment might indicate he's avoiding the conversation rather than the author being at fault. The key here is whether the author had a legitimate reason to ask and if the boyfriend's behavior justifies the author's suspicion.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of combining meds to save space shows intentionality in packing, so the condoms being there intentionally is a red flag. The author's suspicion is within their right to question, especially in a committed relationship. The boyfriend's defensiveness and silence could suggest he's hiding something. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being concerned and asking the question. The boyfriend's actions, not the author's question, are the issue here.\n"
