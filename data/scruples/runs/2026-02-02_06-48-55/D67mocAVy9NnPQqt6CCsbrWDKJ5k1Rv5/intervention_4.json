BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The key points are that the author (AITA) is in a 8-month exclusive relationship. Their boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip without them and the author found condoms in his toiletries bag. She asked him about them, and now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author had a right to be suspicious. Since they're in an exclusive relationship, the boyfriend should be keeping condoms to himself. However, the author didn't snoop; the condoms were in a clear bag. So she didn't violate his privacy by looking through something else. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is important too. He said he always keeps them there, implying that having them in his bag isn't unusual. The author's suspicion might stem from a place of insecurity, which is common in relationships. However, the boyfriend's response to being silent and acting like she ruined New Year's suggests he might feel accused without cause. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for asking? Well, she had a legitimate reason to question it since they're exclusive. She didn't overstep by snooping, just asked about something she saw. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that her suspicion is based on distrust. The real issue here is communication. The author's question was reasonable, but the boyfriend's reaction indicates possible defensiveness or a need for reassurance. \n\nSo, is AITA in the wrong? I think not. She had every right to ask. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
