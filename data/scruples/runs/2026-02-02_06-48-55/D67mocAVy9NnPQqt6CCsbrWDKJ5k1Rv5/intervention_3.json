He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend packed condoms for a trip without her, and she asked him about it. He responded that he always keeps them in his toiletries bag and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment, and she's wondering if she was wrong to be suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They've been in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The author saw the condoms in a visible Ziploc bag while packing. She didn't snoop, just noticed them. She asked a question, but he responded defensively. \n\nIs it reasonable for her to be curious or concerned? In an exclusive relationship, one might expect that the partner wouldn't need to pack condoms unless there's an issue. The boyfriend's behavior of combining medications to save space suggests he's intentional about what he packs. So, her suspicion that the condoms are there for a specific reason might be justified. \n\nBut does her asking the question cross a line? She didn't snoop, just asked a direct question. However, maybe she overreacted by being suspicious without more evidence. On the other hand, his response that he \"always\" keeps them might be a way to avoid addressing her concern. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to the silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's could indicate he's sensitive about the question, which might imply there's something to her suspicion. But the author might also be overstepping by assuming bad faith without clear proof. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's question was valid, but maybe the approach could have been different. However, in an exclusive relationship, the presence of condoms without an explanation could be a red flag. The boyfriend's defensive response without a satisfactory explanation might support her suspicion. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being concerned. She had a right to ask, especially given the context. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive if there's no wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
