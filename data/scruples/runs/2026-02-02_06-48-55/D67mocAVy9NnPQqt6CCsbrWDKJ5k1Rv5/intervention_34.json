He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found condoms in their boyfriend's bag for a trip he's taking without her. They asked why he packed them, and now he's giving them the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive. The key here is whether the boyfriend's action (packing condoms) is a sign of something wrong. The author didn't snoop; they just saw the condoms in a clear bag. The boyfriend says he always keeps them in there and didn't remove them for the trip. The author is suspicious because he combined OTC meds into one bottle to save space, implying he's intentional about what he packs. So the author thinks maybe he's lying about the condoms.\n\nBut the boyfriend's explanation is that he always keeps them. Maybe he's been in a previous relationship where he had to have them, or he's just being prepared. But in an exclusive relationship, condoms might not be necessary unless he's using them for protection against STIs or for other reasons. However, if the relationship is monogamous and both are STI-free, maybe that's not the case.\n\nNow, the author's question is whether they were wrong to ask. The boyfriend is upset and giving the silent treatment. Is the author justified in their suspicion? Well, in an exclusive relationship, if one partner is packing condoms for travel, it could be a red flag. However, the boyfriend's response is that it's routine. If he's always had them, maybe he's not being unfaithful. But the author's suspicion might be valid if there's a pattern of behavior or if there are other red flags.\n\nBut the author didn't accuse him of cheating directly; they just asked why he had them. The boyfriend's reaction of silent treatment might be overreacting. The author's action was to ask a question, which is reasonable given the context. It's natural to feel concerned when seeing condoms in a partner's bag for a solo trip. However, the boyfriend's explanation could be legitimate. The author's suspicion might be unfounded, but that doesn't mean they're wrong for feeling that way. It's more about communication and trust in the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't snoop, they asked a question based on what they saw. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive, but the author's suspicion is understandable. The answer might hinge on whether the boyfriend's explanation is believable. If he's always had them, maybe it's not a big deal. But the author's concern isn't unreasonable. In terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for asking, but the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for asking. They have a right to be curious and concerned in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's overreaction is his issue, not the author's. So the answer would be B.\n"
