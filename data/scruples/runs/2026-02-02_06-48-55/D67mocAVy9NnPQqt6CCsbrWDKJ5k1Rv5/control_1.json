      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend packing condoms for a trip without his girlfriend, who is in an exclusive relationship. The girlfriend saw the condoms in his bag and asked why, leading to the boyfriend giving the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been in a serious, exclusive relationship for 8 months. The boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip without her. She saw the condoms, which were clearly visible in his toiletries bag, and asked why he had them. His response was that he always keeps them and didn't remove them for the trip. The girlfriend is now being accused of ruining New Year's by asking about it, and she's feeling suspicious.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, it's natural to have some level of insecurity or curiosity when a partner is going away for an extended period. Condoms are items that might raise red flags in an exclusive relationship. However, the key here is that she didn't snoop; she saw them plain sight. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them, which might not be a reassuring answer if she feels it's unnecessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his privacy is being invaded. Even if the condoms are visible, bringing it up could be seen as an accusation, especially if he's not in the habit of discussing such things. The silent treatment suggests he's hurt or thinks she's overreacting. \n\nBut considering that they're in an exclusive relationship, expecting monogamy is standard. If he's packing for a trip and includes condoms, it's reasonable for her to question it, especially if she feels his reason (always keeping them) is not convincing. The boyfriend might have a legitimate reason, like being prepared for any situation, but he should have considered her feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is based on suspicion due to previous behaviors (like combining meds to save space), implying that he's intentional about what he packs. If he didn't consider how she'd react, maybe he should have discussed it. However, the act of asking a question isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in the context of their communication and trust levels.\n\nIn conclusion, the girlfriend isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking. It's a valid question given the circumstances. The boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) seems more problematic. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
