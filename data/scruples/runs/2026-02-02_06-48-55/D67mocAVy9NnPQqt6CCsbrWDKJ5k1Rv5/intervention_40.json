BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for questioning her boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without her. They're in an exclusive relationship, so finding condoms might naturally raise suspicions. The key points here are whether the author had a right to ask and if her reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, the author didn't snoop; she saw the condoms in a clear bag. That's important. She's in a committed relationship, so it's reasonable to feel concerned. Her boyfriend's response was that he always keeps condoms in his toiletries, but combining medications to save space shows he's being deliberate with packing. If he's not in the habit of carrying condoms, why now? Maybe he's planning to meet someone else.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is the silent treatment, which is a red flag. Maybe he felt accused without giving him a chance to explain. The author's suspicion is natural in an exclusive relationship, so she's not wrong for being worried. However, maybe the way she approached it was a bit confrontational. But since she didn't snoop and asked a direct question, that's fair. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
