BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about having condoms in his luggage for a trip they aren't going on together.\n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive. The boyfriend is going on a trip without the author and packed condoms. The author sees them in a clear bag and asks why. The boyfriend says he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. The author is suspicious and now the boyfriend is giving them the silent treatment.\n\nSo, the main points here: the boyfriend is in a committed relationship, and the author is upset because he has condoms in his bag. The author didn't snoop, just saw them clearly. The boyfriend's reaction is to ignore them, which is a red flag. \n\nIn an exclusive relationship, having condoms could be a sign of infidelity. The author has a right to feel suspicious because the boyfriend is going somewhere without them, and the condoms are there. The boyfriend's explanation is that he always keeps them, but the author points out he's being careful with space, which makes the author doubt the \"always\" part. \n\nThe boyfriend's silence and acting like the author ruined New Year's suggests he's being defensive. The author's suspicion isn't without cause. If the relationship is exclusive, the boyfriend should have no need for condoms. The author's question is valid because they're concerned about possible cheating. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being suspicious. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014keeping condoms in an exclusive relationship and then being upset when questioned\u2014is the issue. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
