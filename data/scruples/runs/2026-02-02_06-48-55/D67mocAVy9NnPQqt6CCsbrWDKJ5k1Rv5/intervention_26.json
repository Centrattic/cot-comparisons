BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who packed condoms for a trip without the other person. They're in an exclusive relationship, so the author is upset and asking if they're at fault for bringing it up.\n\nFirst, the author saw the condoms in a clear bag, not by snooping, just because it was visible. They asked why he packed them. The boyfriend said he always keeps them in his toiletries and didn't remove them for the trip. Then he gave the silent treatment, implying he's upset about the question.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're wrong for being suspicious. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, in an exclusive relationship, trust is key. However, even in trust, if someone packs condoms for a trip where they're not with their partner, it's natural to be concerned. But the author didn't snoop, just noticed and asked. The boyfriend's reaction is about the question, not the act of packing condoms. \n\nBut maybe the author overreacted? If the boyfriend said he always packs them, maybe it's not a big deal. However, in a long-term exclusive relationship, bringing condoms for a trip might be seen as something that could cause jealousy or insecurity. The author's suspicion is valid if they feel insecure, but the way they addressed it (directly asking) is okay. However, the boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) is a red flag.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the question was justified. Since they didn't snoop and the condoms were visible, asking is reasonable. The boyfriend being upset about the question suggests he might have something to hide, but the author isn't wrong for expressing their concern. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
