      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip without her, and she found condoms in his packed toiletries bag. She asked him why, and he said he always keeps them there and didn't take them out for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship context. They're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. The key point here is whether it's normal or reasonable for her to question the presence of condoms. Since the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, having condoms might seem contradictory. But maybe he uses them for other reasons, like protection against STIs even within the relationship. However, the author is suspicious because he didn't remove them for the trip, even though he's packing efficiently by combining meds.\n\nThe author didn't snoop; the condoms were in a visible bag. So, she's not violating trust by looking through his things. But the boyfriend is upset that she asked. His reaction (silent treatment) suggests he feels accused. Maybe he feels that her question implies he's being unfaithful, even if that's not his intention. \n\nIs it fair for her to ask? In an exclusive relationship, condoms can be a sensitive topic. If they trust each other, maybe he uses them for other purposes, like travel safety, but she might not know that. However, the fact that he's going away for three weeks without her could make her question why he's bringing them. \n\nThe boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there. If that's the case, maybe he just hasn't changed his routine. But she might expect that on a trip without her, he wouldn't need them. But it's possible he's using them for other reasons, like in case of emergencies or if he meets someone else, which would be a problem in an exclusive relationship.\n\nThe author's suspicion is understandable given the context of an exclusive relationship and the trip being without her. The boyfriend's silent treatment might be an overreaction, but maybe he feels defensive. The question is whether the author overstepped by asking. Since she didn't snoop and the condoms were visible, her question seems reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate a lack of transparency or trust on his part. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for asking. She's entitled to be curious and express her feelings, especially in an exclusive relationship where trust is key. The boyfriend's reaction points to possible issues in the relationship rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
