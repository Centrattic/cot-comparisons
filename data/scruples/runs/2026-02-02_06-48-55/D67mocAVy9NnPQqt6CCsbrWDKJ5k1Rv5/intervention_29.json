BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for confronting their boyfriend about the condoms he packed during a trip. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip without her.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author found the condoms in a visible Ziploc bag while the boyfriend was packing. They asked why he had them, and the boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there. Now, the boyfriend is giving silent treatment because the author questioned this.\n\nThe author's argument is that they are justified in being suspicious, especially since they mention that the boyfriend was being meticulous about packing, like combining OTC meds to save space. So, if he was careful about other items, why have condoms in plain sight? The boyfriend's reaction is anger and silence, which the author finds unreasonable.\n\nNow, considering trust in relationships. In an exclusive relationship, both partners are expected to have trust. However, it's also normal for one to have concerns if something seems off. The author didn't snoop; the condoms were visible. So the act of asking isn't inherently wrong. But the boyfriend's reaction might indicate a deeper issue, like not being transparent or having a valid reason to keep condoms (maybe for medical reasons or just preparedness), but the author's suspicion is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship allows for some privacy, maybe the boyfriend has a right to keep certain items without being questioned. However, the author's action was a direct question about something they noticed, which is a reasonable response. The boyfriend's response of silence might indicate he feels accused without cause, but the author isn't wrong for expressing concern.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there, maybe the author is overreacting by assuming something nefarious. But given that it's an exclusive relationship, even if he keeps them for preparedness, the presence without explanation could be a red flag. The author's suspicion isn't unwarranted, but the way it was handled might be the issue.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, as it's a legitimate concern. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he feels accused, but the author had a reason to be curious. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they acted on a reasonable suspicion without invading privacy. The boyfriend's defensive reaction might be the problem, not the question itself.\n"
