BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is at fault for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months, and the boyfriend is going on a three-week trip. The author found the condoms in his bag, which was open and visible, and asked about them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the visibility of the condoms and the author's question. Since the condoms were in a clear Ziploc bag of toiletries and not hidden, the author didn't have to search for them. The act of asking is natural given the circumstances of an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) seems to indicate that he might have something to hide, but the author's suspicion is understandable. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend mentioned he always keeps them in his toiletries. That could be a normal practice for him, like carrying them as a precaution even if he's not planning to use them. On the other hand, the author's suspicion might be valid if the boyfriend's behavior changes. But the author's question was based on observation, not snooping. \n\nI should also think about trust in relationships. In an exclusive relationship, it's reasonable to expect fidelity. The boyfriend's refusal to address the question and his silent treatment could be a sign of defensiveness. The author's reaction might stem from feeling betrayed or insecure, but the question itself isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's action of combining OTC meds shows he's making intentional space-saving decisions. If he's intentional with other items, the condoms being there might be intentional too. However, the author's question is a legitimate inquiry given the situation. The boyfriend's response being dismissive and then punishing the author with the silent treatment might indicate his own insecurity or something he's not admitting. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't at fault for asking. They didn't snoop; the condoms were visible. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author has a right to be curious and voice their concerns in a relationship. The boyfriend's behavior suggests he might have issues with the question, which is on him, not the author.\n"
