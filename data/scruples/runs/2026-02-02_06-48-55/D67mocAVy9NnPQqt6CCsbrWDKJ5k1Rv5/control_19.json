He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip they're not going on together. The relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend is leaving for three weeks.\n\nFirst, the author saw the condoms in plain sight in his toiletries bag. They didn't snoop, just noticed them while he was packing. The question was a legitimate concern, given the exclusivity of the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction was to give the silent treatment and act like the question ruined New Year's. \n\nIn an exclusive relationship, both partners are expected to be faithful. The author's suspicion isn't unfounded, especially since the boyfriend didn't remove the condoms for the trip. The fact that he combined meds to save space suggests he's intentional about packing, so the condoms being there might be intentional too. \n\nHowever, the author didn't confront him in a confrontational way; they just asked a question. The boyfriend's response was to withdraw emotionally, which could indicate defensiveness. The key here is whether the author had a right to ask the question. In an exclusive relationship, partners should be transparent. The author's action was about seeking clarity, not accusing him. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has a valid reason, like medical or personal use, not related to infidelity. But the author's suspicion is based on the context of the situation. The boyfriend's reaction seems to validate her suspicion because he's avoiding addressing the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for asking. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
