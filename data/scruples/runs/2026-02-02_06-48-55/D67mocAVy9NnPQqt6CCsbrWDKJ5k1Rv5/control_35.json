BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend seeing her boyfriend packing condoms for a trip without her and questioning him about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is in an exclusive relationship, so trust is a big factor here. The boyfriend is going on a three-week trip, and the girlfriend noticed condoms in his bag. She didn't snoop; they were in a clear bag. When she asked, he said he always packs them. Now he's giving her the silent treatment.\n\nFrom her perspective, seeing condoms might naturally make her suspicious, especially since it's a long trip without her. But does that make her in the wrong? Well, in an exclusive relationship, both partners should be comfortable with each other's habits. If he always packs condoms, maybe that's just his routine. However, the girlfriend's concern could stem from a place of insecurity or lack of communication.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction\u2014silent treatment\u2014seems extreme. His response that it's just his habit might not address her feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend's action was to ask a question upon seeing something that caught her attention. She didn't snoop, which is important. \n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, she had a reason to be curious, given the context. But maybe she could have approached it differently? However, the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. The question is if she's in the wrong for being suspicious. Since the condoms were plainly visible and she asked a question, which he dismissed, it's more about his response than her question. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
