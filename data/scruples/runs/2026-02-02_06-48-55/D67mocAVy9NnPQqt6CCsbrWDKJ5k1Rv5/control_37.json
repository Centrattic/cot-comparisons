BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip without them. They're in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is going abroad for three weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend didn't pack the condoms as an accident\u2014he's been combining medications to save space, so it's likely intentional. The author saw the condoms in a clear bag, didn't snoop, just asked about them. The boyfriend is now giving her the silent treatment, implying he's upset. \n\nIn an exclusive relationship, trust is key. The author's suspicion is understandable. Condoms in a partner's packing list for a trip without the other person could be seen as odd, especially if they\u2019re monogamous. However, maybe the boyfriend has a valid reason\u2014he might just keep them for emergencies or health reasons. But the author's concern is about his behavior\u2014why keep them if they're exclusive? \n\nBut the author didn't accuse him of cheating or anything; they just asked a question. The boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) seems extreme. Maybe he's hiding something, or maybe he's overreacting. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Since the condoms were visible and the author didn't invade privacy, asking a question isn't wrong. Jealousy and suspicion are natural, but the act of questioning isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being curious and questioning something that seems out of context in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's response is more concerning. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
