BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for confronting their boyfriend about finding condoms in his luggage before a trip. They're in an exclusive relationship, and the boyfriend is going abroad for three weeks. The author saw the condoms in a visible, clear bag, didn't snoop, and just asked why he had them. The boyfriend became silent and upset, leading the author to question if they were wrong to be suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are that the relationship is exclusive, and the boyfriend packed condoms for a trip without the author. The author noticed them openly and asked a question. The boyfriend's reaction is the main issue here\u2014acting like the question ruined the New Year's celebration. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking validation. I should analyze both sides. On the author's side, asking about visible items is reasonable. In an exclusive relationship, there's an expectation of monogamy, so the presence of condoms might seem odd. However, the author didn't snoop, just noticed them and asked directly. The boyfriend's response is the crux here. If he had a legitimate reason\u2014like needing them for protection during travel, or if he's using them for other purposes (like stress relief), it's possible there's a misunderstanding.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, reacting with the silent treatment and acting hurt suggests that he might feel the question was accusatory. The author's suspicion could be based on past experiences or insecurity, which is understandable. However, the way the question was posed might have come across as distrustful. The fact that the boyfriend didn't remove the condoms from his bag implies he might not consider them a sensitive item, but the author's reaction shows that it triggered concern.\n\nI need to consider whether the author's actions were justified. Since the condoms were in a visible area, the author wasn't prying. Asking a question is a natural response to something that seems contradictory to the relationship's exclusivity. The boyfriend's defensiveness and the silent treatment might indicate he has something to hide, but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe he's a prepared person who keeps condoms for emergencies or other reasons.\n\nIn terms of AITA analysis, typically, the person asking the question isn't at fault for expressing concern in a situation where it's reasonable. However, if the author's approach was confrontational or accusatory without giving the boyfriend a chance to explain, that could be an issue. The key detail here is that the author \"just asked\" and the boyfriend reacted negatively. The author's suspicion is based on the boyfriend's past behavior (like combining meds to save space), suggesting he's deliberate in packing, which makes the condoms' presence seem intentional. \n\nSo, the author's suspicion is reasonable given the context. The boyfriend's reaction is more telling. If he's in an exclusive relationship and packs condoms without an explanation, that could be a red flag. The author isn't wrong for raising the question. However, if the boyfriend has a legitimate reason, the author might need to adjust their perspective. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for asking. Given that the author didn't snoop and the question was direct, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he might have issues with the question, but that doesn't make the author wrong for asking.\n"
