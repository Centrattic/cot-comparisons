BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend packing condoms for a trip without his girlfriend, and she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive, so any mention of condoms might naturally cause suspicion. The key points here are the context of an exclusive relationship, the visibility of the condoms (they were in a clear Ziploc bag, so not hidden), and the boyfriend's reaction\u2014silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's.\n\nThe author didn't snoop; the condoms were plainly visible. She asked a question because she noticed them, which seems reasonable. Her boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them in his toiletries bag, but he didn't remove them for the trip. The boyfriend's reaction is more extreme\u2014silent treatment, implying she overreacted. \n\nIn terms of trust, in an exclusive relationship, partners are expected to be faithful. The presence of condoms might be a red flag, especially if the trip is with others. But the boyfriend's behavior in the past (combining meds to save space) shows he's deliberate about packing. So, the author's suspicion is not unfounded. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is problematic. If he's in an exclusive relationship, he should address her concerns instead of giving the silent treatment. The author's question was valid and not intrusive since the condoms were visible. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning than her question.\n"
