      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about him packing condoms on a trip without her. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months, and the boyfriend is going abroad for 3 weeks. The user saw the condoms in a visible bag and asked him about it. His response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now, he's giving her the silent treatment and she's feeling suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the relationship. It's exclusive, so the boyfriend is supposed to be abstaining from other partners. The user's question is about why he packed condoms, which is a valid concern given the exclusivity. The boyfriend's answer is that he always has them in his toiletries bag. But the user points out that he's meticulous about saving space, combining OTC meds into one bottle. That contradicts the idea that the condoms were just always there by accident.\n\nSo, the user's suspicion is based on the boyfriend's inconsistency in packing habits. If he usually keeps condoms in his toiletries, but also makes an effort to save space by combining items, then not removing the condoms for a trip without his partner seems odd. That could imply that he's planning to use them during the trip, which would be a breach of the exclusive agreement.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is giving the silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's. That's a red flag for how he's handling the situation. Healthy relationships should involve open communication, especially about exclusivity and trust issues. The user's question was reasonable, and his defensive reaction might indicate that he's hiding something.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend is just being overly sensitive. Some people carry condoms for unexpected situations, even in exclusive relationships, as a precaution. However, given the context of the trip and the exclusivity, it's understandable for the user to be concerned. The key here is whether the user overstepped by asking about something that's relevant to the relationship's boundaries.\n\nSince the condoms were in a visible place and she didn't snoop, her question was fair. The boyfriend's response that he always keeps them there might not be truthful if his usual practice is to optimize his packing. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for questioning it, especially since it's a part of maintaining trust in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning than the user's question.\n"
