BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend why he packed condoms on a trip without them. The relationship is supposed to be exclusive. The boyfriend is going on a three-week trip and the author saw the condoms in his bag when he wasn't done packing. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them in his toiletries bag and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving the silent treatment, which is making the author feel like they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a right to ask. Since the relationship is exclusive, the boyfriend shouldn't be planning to use condoms with someone else. So the author's suspicion is understandable. The condoms were in a clear bag, so the author didn't have to snoop\u2014they just saw them. That seems reasonable to question. But maybe the boyfriend's reaction is over the top. \n\nThe boyfriend might have a legitimate reason for keeping condoms in his bag, like for safe sex in case of a medical emergency or just habit. However, in an exclusive relationship, the expectation is that both partners aren't needing to use condoms with others. So the author's question is about checking if the boyfriend is being unfaithful. \n\nThe boyfriend's response that he always keeps them there might not be convincing, especially if the author knows he's made other efforts to save space, like combining meds. If he truly always has them, why keep them for a trip where he's not with others? The silent treatment after a legitimate question could indicate he's hiding something. \n\nSo, the author's action was to ask a question based on what they saw. They didn't snoop, just asked. The boyfriend's reaction is causing tension, but the author's action in itself seems justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
