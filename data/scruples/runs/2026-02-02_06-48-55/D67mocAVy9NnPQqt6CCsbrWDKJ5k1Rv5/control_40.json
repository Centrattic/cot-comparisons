BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without her. The relationship is exclusive, and the author noticed the condoms in a clear bag, didn't snoop, just asked about them. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving silent treatment.\n\nFirst, in an exclusive relationship, both parties are expected to be faithful. The author's suspicion is understandable because condoms in a trip bag could imply he's expecting to have sex with someone else. The fact that he combined OTC meds to save space suggests he's being intentional with his packing, so the condoms being there isn't accidental. The author's question is a valid expression of concern in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (silent treatment) might indicate defensiveness, which could imply guilt or at least something to hide. \n\nThe key points: the author didn't snoop, just asked a question based on observation. In an exclusive relationship, such a question is reasonable. The boyfriend's response and subsequent behavior might be the real issue here. So the author isn't in the wrong for asking. Answer B.\n"
