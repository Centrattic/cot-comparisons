      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without her. The relationship is supposed to be exclusive, and the boyfriend's response made her suspicious, leading to the silent treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for 8 months, and it's stated as exclusive. The boyfriend is going on a 3-week trip without her. The user saw the condoms in a visible place in his packing and asked about them. He said it's something he always does, but she's now suspicious because he's acting like she ruined New Year's. \n\nNow, the key points here are whether the user's action was justified. In an exclusive relationship, both partners are expected to be faithful. If the user found condoms in his bag, asking about them isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's response was that he always keeps them in there, which might be his habit, but the user is questioning why he didn't remove them for the trip. \n\nThe boyfriend combining OTC meds to save space shows he's being thoughtful about packing. However, not removing the condoms might be because he feels they're a regular item he carries. But since the trip is without the user, she might think he's planning to meet someone else. \n\nThe user's action was to ask directly when she saw them, which is natural. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's\u2014indicates he might be defensive or hiding something. The user's suspicion is based on his behavior and his response. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the boyfriend isn't transparent about his actions, that could be an issue. The user isn't wrong for questioning something that seems out of context for an exclusive trip. The boyfriend's behavior after being asked is more concerning. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for asking. The boyfriend's actions and response might be the real problem here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
