      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for questioning their boyfriend about packing condoms during a trip he's taking without her. They're in an exclusive relationship, so the boyfriend going on a trip without her isn't the issue per se. The main points here are about the condoms being in a visible toiletries bag and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend is going abroad for three weeks, and the author, who's in a monogamous relationship, noticed condoms in his bag. She asked about them, and he said he always keeps them there. Now he's giving her the silent treatment. The author is wondering if she's overstepping.\n\nSo, in a committed relationship, both parties are expected to be faithful. The presence of condoms in a visible place might be concerning because it's a sign that he's prepared for potential sexual activity, which could imply he's not following the exclusivity agreement. However, maybe he just keeps them there as a general precaution, especially since he's a responsible person (as hinted by combining meds to save space). But the key here is that the author is being suspicious, and the boyfriend is acting like she ruined the evening by asking.\n\nThe question is about whether her suspicion is justified. Arguments for her being in the wrong: maybe she's being paranoid without evidence, or the boyfriend's explanation is that he just keeps them in his toiletries bag as a habit, and she shouldn't question it. But if they've been in an exclusive relationship for 8 months, the boyfriend should have adjusted his usual habits to avoid any misunderstandings. Packing condoms for a trip without his partner might be seen as a red flag, especially if he's not providing a satisfactory reason. The fact that she didn't snoop but saw them plainly could mitigate the \"overstepping\" part. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction to the silent treatment seems excessive. If he's truly committed, he might have had a reasonable explanation. The author's question is valid because in an exclusive relationship, such items shouldn't be necessary unless there's infidelity. The boyfriend's refusal to engage or explain further might be the real issue here. So, the author's suspicion isn't unwarranted if she's in an exclusive relationship. She has a right to feel concerned, and the boyfriend's behavior in avoiding the topic could be a sign of something to hide. Therefore, the answer is likely B, that she's not in the wrong.\n"
