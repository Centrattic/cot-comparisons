      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend about the condoms he packed for a trip without her. The situation is that they're in an exclusive relationship for 8 months. She saw the condoms in his bag when he was packing, and asked him about it. He said he always keeps them and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment and she's wondering if she was wrong to be suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're in an exclusive relationship, so any expectations about fidelity and privacy come into play. The author saw the condoms while he was packing, which was visible, so she didn't snoop. She asked a question, which seems reasonable. Why would he have condoms if he's in an exclusive relationship? Her suspicion is understandable, especially since they're not open. The boyfriend's reaction is acting like she ruined New Year's, which seems harsh. He combined OTC meds to save space, implying he's intentional about what he packs. So the condoms being there intentionally might be a red flag for her.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he uses condoms for protection against STIs, or maybe he's just being prepared, even though they're in an exclusive relationship. But in an exclusive relationship, the expectation is that both are only with each other, so having condoms might be unnecessary unless there's a health reason. The boyfriend's defensiveness and silence could indicate he feels accused, maybe because he's hiding something. The author's suspicion is a valid reaction. She's not wrong for noticing something that could imply infidelity, especially if there's no prior discussion about such preparedness.\n\nBut, maybe the boyfriend has a legitimate reason. However, the key point is that the author asked a question, not an accusation. The wrong here would depend on whether the question was intrusive. Since the condoms were visible and she asked directly, it's not like she invaded his privacy. So the author isn't in the wrong for raising a legitimate concern. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of a problem. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
