BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a boyfriend packing condoms for a trip he's taking without his girlfriend. The girlfriend saw the condoms in a clear bag, didn't snoop, just asked why he had them. He said he always keeps them there and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive, so the boyfriend is supposed to be faithful. The girl is asking a reasonable question. Condoms in a toiletries bag are noticeable, especially in a clear bag. She didn't snoop, just asked. His reaction seems harsh. The silent treatment is a red flag, maybe he's guilty or thinks she shouldn't have asked.\n\nBut wait, maybe he has a legitimate reason. Some people always carry condoms even in an exclusive relationship. Maybe he's just prepared. However, the girlfriend has a right to be suspicious. If he's in an exclusive relationship, having condoms for other people could imply infidelity. His response that he \"always keeps them\" might not hold up if the situation is different now. Also, the fact that he didn't bother taking them out might mean he expects to use them during the trip, which is concerning.\n\nThe girl's reaction is based on trust issues. In a healthy relationship, partners should be open about such things. If he's not explaining properly, maybe he's hiding something. The silent treatment after a legitimate question could indicate that he's defensive or guilty.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asking. It's a valid question in an exclusive relationship. The boyfriend's response is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
