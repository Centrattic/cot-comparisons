      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their boyfriend about packing condoms on a trip he's taking without her. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the relationship is exclusive and they've been together for 8 months. The boyfriend is going abroad for 3 weeks, and the author saw the condoms in his toiletries bag, which was a clear Ziploc bag. She didn't snoop; the condoms were just visible. She then asked him why he packed them, and he said he always keeps them in his toiletries bag and didn't remove them for the trip. Now he's giving her the silent treatment and acting like she ruined New Year's by asking.\n\nThe author's main concern here is suspicion because her boyfriend is taking condoms on a trip she's not joining. In an exclusive relationship, one would expect that both partners are committed to each other, so the presence of condoms might seem unnecessary if there's no new partner. However, the key point is the boyfriend's response: he says he always keeps them in his toiletries bag. The author is in the wrong if her suspicion is unfounded or if she's overstepping by questioning something he's already explained. On the other hand, if there's a history of trust issues or if the boyfriend's behavior is suspicious despite his explanation, maybe she's justified.\n\nBut according to the information given, the boyfriend is in the 30s, and the trip is without her. Condoms could be for safe sex if he's in a different country, maybe due to different health standards or if he has to visit a doctor, etc. However, since the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, the need for condoms might not be there unless they have specific reasons like STI prevention. But the boyfriend didn't provide that reasoning. He just said he always keeps them. \n\nThe author's action was to ask a question upon seeing the condoms. Since they were in plain sight and she didn't snoop, asking seems reasonable. However, the boyfriend's reaction implies that maybe he didn't want the conversation. The problem is that the author is now suspicious, but does that make her the one at fault? \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of asking a question because something is visible and seems odd isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's response might be the issue here. If he had a valid reason, he could explain it. The silent treatment suggests he might be hiding something or that he's sensitive about the topic. But the author's suspicion is based on the fact that he's taking them on a trip without her, which is a red flag in an exclusive relationship. So, the author has a right to be concerned. However, whether it's \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) depends on context. If the question was asked with trust and the boyfriend's answer was honest, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is overreacting without considering other possibilities, then maybe she is. However, given the exclusive nature, the condoms should be a point of concern. The boyfriend should address it if he has a reason, but the author isn't wrong for questioning something visible in their relationship. So, probably the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
