My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for making her daughter thank a waiter who made them uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the situation: The waiter didn't address the mom, only the daughter, called her \"beautiful,\" gave her cake without ordering, told her it's a secret. The mom felt creeped out because of his tone and behavior, which she recognized as inappropriate from her own experience. She made her daughter thank him, which she later questioned if it was the right move.\n\nSo, the key points here are the waiter's behavior. He was ignoring the parent and focusing solely on the child, making a compliment that's not typically appropriate for a child, and then giving her something without the parent's knowledge. The mom's reaction was to make the daughter thank him, which some might see as odd because the compliment was uncomfortable.\n\nBut is the mom in the wrong? Well, the waiter's actions are definitely sketchy. Complimenting a child on their beauty can be inappropriate, especially when done in a way that excludes the parent. The mom's instinct to be cautious is valid. Making the daughter thank him might seem like reinforcing gratitude, but the mom was uncomfortable, so it's a tough spot. However, forcing gratitude for something that made her uneasy could be confusing for the child. But in this context, the mom's priority was protecting her child, and she felt the waiter was a creep. \n\nThe question is whether making the daughter thank him was wrong. The mom's intention was to handle the situation, maybe to avoid conflict or set an example. But given the waiter's behavior, the mom was protecting her daughter. The father suggests complaining, which is reasonable. \n\nIn terms of the mom's actions, making the child say thank you in that situation could be seen as not modeling the right reaction. The daughter might pick up on the discomfort but be confused about the gratitude. However, the mom's main issue was the waiter's behavior, not the act of making her daughter thank him. So the mom isn't in the wrong for being cautious or for protecting her child. The waiter's actions were the problem. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
