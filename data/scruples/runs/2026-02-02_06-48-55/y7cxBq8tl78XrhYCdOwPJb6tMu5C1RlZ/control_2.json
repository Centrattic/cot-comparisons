My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for being creeped out by a waiter's behavior towards her 4-year-old daughter and for making her say thank you.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter is very talkative and tall for her age, which might make others interact with her as if she's older. The waiter initially seemed okay, but then made a direct compliment to her about being \"beautiful\" without acknowledging the mom. The mom made her daughter thank him, which made her feel uncomfortable because of the waiter's tone and demeanor. Later, the waiter gave the daughter a free cake and told her it's a secret, which the mom found concerning. The mom's partner thinks she should complain.\n\nSo, is the mom in the wrong? Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Parental Instincts and Safety**: As a parent, protecting a child from any potentially inappropriate or uncomfortable situations is a natural reaction. The mom felt uneasy about the waiter's behavior, especially the direct compliment and the secrecy. Even if the waiter's intentions were innocent, the mom's concern is valid because she's responsible for her child's well-being.\n\n2. **Compliment to a Child**: Complimenting a child's appearance, especially using terms like \"beautiful,\" can be problematic. It's a form of attention that might make a child feel objectified. Parents often discourage such interactions because it's not about the child's actions but their looks, which isn't appropriate for someone in a position of power or authority, like a waiter.\n\n3. **Making the Child Thank Him**: The mom made her daughter thank the waiter, which might seem like enforcing politeness. However, if the mom herself felt the situation was uncomfortable, forcing gratitude could be confusing for the child. The child might not understand why they have to be polite to someone who made the parent uneasy. But in this case, the mom was acting to teach her daughter to respond appropriately in social situations while also recognizing the discomfort.\n\n4. **Cultural Norms and Boundaries**: In many cultures, adults are discouraged from making direct, personal comments to children, especially about their appearance. The waiter's approach, not addressing the parent, and the secrecy could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The mother's reaction is a protective measure.\n\n5. **The Waiter's Actions**: The waiter's behavior\u2014repeatedly commenting, not acknowledging the parent, giving unrequested items, and suggesting secrecy\u2014could be interpreted as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Parents have a right to be cautious in such scenarios.\n\n6. **Partner's Advice**: The partner advising to complain is a common response when a parent feels something is off. The restaurant might need to be informed to prevent future issues, but the mom's initial reaction is more about immediate safety and comfort.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the mom's actions stem from protecting her child and responding to a situation that made her uncomfortable. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable given the context. She didn't act in a confrontational way initially, allowed interaction when it seemed okay, but took action when she felt it crossed a line. Making the child thank the waiter might have been a way to navigate the situation without escalating it immediately, while still asserting her discomfort.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). Her actions were a reasonable response to protect her daughter, especially given the potential inappropriateness of the waiter's behavior. It's not about the waiter's age but about ensuring the child's safety and comfort. Parents have the right to set boundaries and react to what they perceive as a threat, even if others might not see it the same way.\n"
