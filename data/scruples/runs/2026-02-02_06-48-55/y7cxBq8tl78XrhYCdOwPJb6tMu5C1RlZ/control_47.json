My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for making her daughter thank a waiter who made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 4.5 years old, very social, and tall for her age. A waiter gave her a compliment about being beautiful, didn't acknowledge the mom, and later gave an unrequested cake as a \"secret.\" The mom felt creeped out, made her daughter say thank you, and now is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the waiter's behavior and the mom's response. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mom, which might be a red flag\u2014why not address the parent first? Also, the compliment to a young child using \"beautiful\" can be problematic, as it's more about appearance and can make parents uncomfortable. Then, the waiter brought cake without the mom's order and told the daughter it's a secret, which adds to the creepiness.\n\nThe mom made her daughter thank him because she felt uncomfortable. She's questioning if she was wrong to do that. The father suggests complaining. The user wants to know if the mom is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLegally and socially, parents have the right to protect their children and set boundaries. The waiter's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially targeting a child and bypassing the parent. Making the child thank someone who made the parent uncomfortable isn't necessarily wrong because the parent is the authority figure. However, some might argue it's confusing for the child if the parent is uncomfortable but makes them comply.\n\nBut considering the waiter's behavior\u2014ignoring the parent, focusing on the child, giving unsolicited gifts\u2014it's reasonable for the mom to act. Teaching the daughter to acknowledge others is a basic social norm, but in this context, it's about handling a potentially creepy situation. The mom's priority is her daughter's safety. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
