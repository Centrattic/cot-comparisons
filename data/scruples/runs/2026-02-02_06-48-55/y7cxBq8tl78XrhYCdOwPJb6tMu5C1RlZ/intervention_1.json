My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being creeped out by a waiter's behavior toward her daughter and making her say thank you.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is 4 years old, very talkative, and tall for her age. The waiter gives her a compliment about being \"beautiful,\" ignores the mother, gives her cake without being asked, and tells her it's a secret. The mother made her daughter thank him, and now she's conflicted about whether she did the right thing.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's discomfort with the waiter's behavior. She mentions his tone and look, which made her uneasy. The compliment's wording (\"beautiful\") is considered inappropriate for a young child. Also, the waiter bypassed the parent, which is a red flag. The mother made her daughter thank him, which she later questions.\n\nIn terms of the mother's actions, she's trying to teach her daughter manners. But the context here is that she perceived the waiter as being inappropriate. Making the child thank someone who made her uncomfortable could be seen as conflicting. However, the mother's instinct to protect her child is natural. The waiter's actions\u2014ignoring the parent, giving unsolicited gifts, using a tone that's off-putting\u2014are signs of inappropriate behavior. \n\nIn most cases, parents have the right to be vigilant about strangers' behavior around their children. The mother's discomfort is valid, especially given her experience. She's also a single parent, which might add to her sensitivity. The father's suggestion to complain is reasonable, as the restaurant should be aware of such behavior. \n\nThe mother isn't in the wrong for being cautious. Making the child thank him might have been a way to handle the situation on the spot, but the underlying issue is the waiter's conduct. The mother's responsibility is to protect her child, so her actions are justified. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
