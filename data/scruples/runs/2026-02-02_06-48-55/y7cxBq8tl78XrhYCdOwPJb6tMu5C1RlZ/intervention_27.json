My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mom and her 4-year-old daughter. The daughter is outgoing and talks to everyone. At a caf\u00e9 they frequent, a waiter gives her a compliment, then later gives her a free cake without the mom's knowledge. The mom made her daughter say thank you after the waiter talked to her in a way that made the mom uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the mom felt creeped out by the waiter's behavior. The waiter addressed the daughter directly with a compliment about her being \"beautiful\" and later gave her a cake as a \"secret.\" The mom is concerned about her daughter being noticed by someone creepy. She made her daughter thank the waiter, which she now questions if she was wrong to do. The father thinks she should complain to the restaurant.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's judgment about the waiter's behavior and her actions in making her daughter thank him. The user initially thought the author (mom) is in the wrong but wants to see my analysis.\n\nLet me break it down. The waiter's actions\u2014focusing on the child, not the parent, giving a compliment about appearance, then giving a free cake as a secret\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The mom felt uncomfortable, which is a valid feeling. When someone makes you uncomfortable, especially around your child, it's reasonable to take steps to protect them.\n\nThe mom made her daughter say thank you. But why? If she thought the waiter was a creep, making her daughter thank him might inadvertently validate the interaction. However, the mom might have been trying to teach her daughter to be polite, even in uncomfortable situations. But given her discomfort, maybe she should have prioritized shielding her daughter from the interaction instead of making her respond.\n\nHowever, the mother's primary concern was her daughter's safety and well-being. The waiter's behavior could be a red flag, especially not acknowledging the parent, treating the child as if they're an adult, and creating a secret between them. This is a classic red flag for someone who might have inappropriate intentions towards a child.\n\nIn terms of the mom's actions: making her daughter thank him might have been an attempt to handle the situation gracefully without causing a scene. But given her own discomfort, she might have been conflicted. The key is whether her actions were in her daughter's best interest. Since she felt the waiter was creepy, it's possible that making her daughter interact with him could be seen as not protecting her enough. However, the alternative would be to confront the waiter immediately, which could escalate things or make the daughter feel confused.\n\nThe father's suggestion to complain is also valid because if the waiter's behavior is inappropriate, the restaurant should be aware. The user's question is whether the mom was wrong for making her daughter thank him. The answer hinges on whether the mom's actions were appropriate given her assessment of the situation. Since she felt the waiter was a creep, making her daughter respond might have been a mistake, as it could imply that such interactions are acceptable.\n\nBut on the other hand, teaching a child to be polite is important. The mom had to balance that with her instinct to protect. Given that the waiter's behavior was questionable, the mom's priority should have been to minimize the interaction and ensure her daughter's safety, not to enforce politeness in a situation that made her uncomfortable.\n\nTherefore, the author (the mom) is not in the wrong because she acted on her concern for her child's well-being. The issue is more about the waiter's behavior than her response to it. The right choice is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
