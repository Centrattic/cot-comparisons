My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mom and her 4-year-old daughter at a restaurant. The waiter kept complimenting the child, saying she's beautiful, not acknowledging the mom, and even giving her cake secretly. The mom made the daughter say thank you, and now she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from different angles. The main points here are the waiter's behavior and the mother's response. The waiter approached the child directly, didn't address the mother, and gave unsolicited compliments. The mom felt uncomfortable and made her daughter thank him. Later, the waiter gave her cake as a \"secret\" between them. \n\nThe key factors here are the appropriateness of the waiter's actions and the mother's reaction. The waiter's behavior could be seen as inappropriate, especially since he didn't interact with the mother and targeted the child. Complimenting a child on their beauty might be crossing a line, especially if done in a way that makes the parent uncomfortable. The mother's action of making the daughter thank him could be seen as contradictory, but she was acting on her own discomfort and trying to teach her daughter to be polite.\n\nHowever, from the mother's perspective, she's protecting her child. She might have felt the need to maintain social norms, even if the situation felt off. But her discomfort is valid, and she's in a position to set boundaries for her daughter's interactions. The father's suggestion to complain is reasonable because the waiter's behavior could be seen as creepy, especially the \"secret\" cake part.\n\nNow, considering if the mother is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The mother's actions were in response to a situation she found uncomfortable. Making the daughter thank him was a reaction to the waiter's behavior. Since she didn't want to humiliate the daughter but wanted her to respond politely, it's a common social expectation. However, the mother's discomfort is valid, and she's not in the wrong for protecting her child. The waiter's actions were questionable, so the mother isn't at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
