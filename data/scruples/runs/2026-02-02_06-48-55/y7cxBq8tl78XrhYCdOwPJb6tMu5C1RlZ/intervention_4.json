My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where a waiter treated her daughter in a way that made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the context: the daughter is 4 years old, very talkative, and the waiter kept looking at her and gave a compliment about her being beautiful. The mother made her daughter say thank you. The waiter later gave her a free cake and told her it's a secret. The mother is a single parent, and the father thinks she should complain.\n\nSo, the key points are: the waiter didn't acknowledge the mother, focused on the child, used the word \"beautiful\" which the mother found inappropriate, and the mother made her daughter thank him even though she felt uncomfortable.\n\nI need to consider if the mother was wrong to make her daughter say thank you. From a parental perspective, the mother is trying to protect her child. The waiter's behavior seems to bypass the parent and directly target the child, which can be concerning. The mother recognized the potential creepiness based on her experience. Making the child thank someone who made her feel uncomfortable might be confusing for the child, but the mother's intent was to manage the situation without escalating it. However, the father thinks she should have complained, which is another angle.\n\nLegally and socially, adults should treat children's parents as the authority. The waiter's actions\u2014ignoring the parent, complimenting the child in a way that's more appropriate for adults, and giving unsolicited gifts\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The mother's response was to make the child acknowledge the compliment, which is a way to close the interaction. Whether she was wrong depends on whether her action was the best in that situation. Since she felt uncomfortable and was protecting her child, it's more about the waiter's behavior than her response. The mother isn't the one in the wrong here; the waiter's conduct was questionable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
