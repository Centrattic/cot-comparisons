My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a single mother) is in the wrong for her actions in a situation where a waiter made her daughter uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the context: The mother took her 4-year-old daughter to a restaurant they frequent. The daughter is talkative and tall for her age, which might make adults interact with her as if she's older. The waiter complimented the daughter by calling her \"beautiful\" and later gave her a free slice of cake without acknowledging the mother. The mother felt uncomfortable with the waiter's behavior, made her daughter thank him, and later considered complaining.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Parental Instincts and Judgment**: As a parent, the mother's primary concern is her child's safety and well-being. Feeling that someone's behavior is inappropriate, even if others might not see it that way, is a valid reason for taking action. The mother mentions she's seen similar looks from men before, which adds to her discomfort.\n\n2. **Appropriateness of Compliments**: The term \"beautiful\" can be seen as a compliment, but when directed at a young child and combined with the waiter not acknowledging the mother, it raises red flags. The fact that the waiter treated the child like a secret (telling her not to tell the mother about the free cake) is concerning. Compliments to children should be about their actions or behavior, not their appearance, especially from adults.\n\n3. **Forcing the Child to Thank the Waiter**: The mother made her daughter say thank you after a compliment that made her uncomfortable. While teaching children to be polite is important, forcing gratitude in a situation that the parent deems inappropriate might be conflicting. However, the mother's intention was to model polite behavior, which is a common practice. The daughter was likely confused and didn't respond initially, so prompting her to respond could be seen as trying to maintain social norms, even if the parent felt uneasy.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Norms**: Some might argue that the waiter's actions were just friendly, but the mother's reaction is rooted in her perception of possible inappropriate behavior. Trusting one's instincts as a parent is often encouraged, especially in ambiguous situations. The waiter's behavior of not acknowledging the mother and treating the child as a \"secret\" could be interpreted as overstepping boundaries.\n\n5. **Possible Overreaction vs. Underreaction**: The user initially thought the mother was in the wrong, but considering the details\u2014like the waiter not addressing the mother, the specific choice of words, and the secret about the cake\u2014it seems the mother's caution is justified. The father's suggestion to complain is supported here, as it's better to report potentially inappropriate behavior to prevent it from happening again.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother acted on her parental concerns to protect her daughter. Her actions, while involving making the child thank someone she found creepy, were in response to behaviors that could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, she is not in the wrong.\n"
