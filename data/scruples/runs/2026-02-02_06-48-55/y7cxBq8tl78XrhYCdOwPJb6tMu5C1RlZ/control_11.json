My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this situation. So the user is asking whether the person (a single mom) is at fault for making her daughter thank the waiter after he gave a compliment they both found creepy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The mom and her 4-year-old daughter are at a family-run caf\u00e9. The daughter is very talkative and tall for her age, so she might be mistaken for older. The waiter gave a compliment on her being \"beautiful,\" which the mom found uncomfortable because of the tone and the waiter's attitude. The waiter also gave the girl cake without the mom's knowledge and kept the compliment a secret. The mom made the girl thank him, even though she felt it was inappropriate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mom was wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\n1. **The Waiter's Behavior**: The waiter addressed the daughter directly, didn't acknowledge the mom, used the word \"beautiful,\" and later gave her a secret slice of cake. The mom felt it was a creepy situation, especially because she's seen that tone before. The daughter is only 4, so a compliment like that might not be appropriate, especially coming from a man in his 50s. The waiter's actions could be seen as overstepping professional boundaries.\n\n2. **Making the Daughter Thank Him**: The mom made her daughter thank the waiter. The daughter didn't respond initially, so the mom had to intervene. The user is questioning if making the child thank someone who might be a creep is wrong. \n\n3. **Parental Instincts**: As a parent, the mom is trying to protect her child. She felt uncomfortable and wanted to teach her daughter to be polite, but she's also worried about endorsing the waiter's behavior by making her thank him. \n\n4. **Father's Suggestion**: The father thinks she should complain. So there's a conflict between the parent's approach here.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, it's important to teach children about personal space and appropriate interactions. The waiter's behavior could be predatory or at least unprofessional. The mom's discomfort is valid. Making the daughter thank him might have been an attempt to maintain politeness, but in hindsight, maybe she should have corrected the behavior instead of reinforcing it with gratitude.\n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is whether the mother acted inappropriately. Since the waiter's behavior was questionable, the mom's reaction\u2014feeling creeped out and wanting to protect her daughter\u2014is understandable. Making the daughter thank him might not be the best approach because it could send a message that the behavior is okay. But in the moment, she might have wanted to model polite behavior despite her discomfort.\n\nAlso, the daughter is very young. At 4, she might not understand the nuances of the situation. The mother is trying to navigate a tricky situation where she has to balance teaching her daughter to be polite and protecting her from inappropriate attention.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, complimenting a child on their appearance isn't inherently wrong, but the manner and context matter. The waiter's approach\u2014ignoring the parent, using a specific word like \"beautiful,\" and giving a secret gift\u2014crosses into inappropriate territory. The mom's reaction is a protective instinct.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mom isn't in the wrong. She's responding to a situation where she felt her daughter was being noticed in a way that was uncomfortable. The waiter's actions were the issue, not her trying to make her daughter thank him, even if it was awkward. The real problem is the waiter's behavior, not the mother's reaction.\n"
