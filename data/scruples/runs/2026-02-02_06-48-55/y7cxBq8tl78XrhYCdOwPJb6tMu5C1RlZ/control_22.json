My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a single mom and her 4-year-old daughter interacting with a waiter at a caf\u00e9. The waiter gives the daughter a compliment about being beautiful and later gives her a free cake slice without the mom's knowledge. The mom made her daughter thank him, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mom, focused solely on the child with a compliment that's more appropriate for an adult. The mom felt uncomfortable because of the tone and the way he looked. She made her daughter thank him, even though she felt he was a creep. The father suggests complaining, so that's a point of conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Let's break down the elements. The daughter is a very social child, tall for her age, which might make adults interact with her as if she's older. The waiter's behavior could be seen as inappropriate, especially targeting a young child with a compliment that's more suited for an adult. The mom's response was to make her daughter thank him, which might seem counterintuitive if she sensed something wrong.\n\nBut why might she be in the wrong? If the mom felt uncomfortable, it's reasonable to protect her daughter. However, teaching the daughter to be polite even in uncomfortable situations is part of social training. But the key is whether the waiter's behavior crossed a line. Complimenting a child on their beauty can be problematic, as it's not a compliment that's age-appropriate and might have ulterior motives.\n\nThe waiter also bypassed the parent entirely, which is a red flag. He gave the cake as a secret, which is concerning. The mom's instinct to protect her daughter is valid. Making her daughter thank him could be seen as trying to maintain social grace while still ensuring the daughter knows not to engage further. The father's advice to complain makes sense because the restaurant should address such behavior to protect children.\n\nSo, the mom isn't in the wrong for being protective and teaching her daughter to be polite, even if she felt uncomfortable. She's also right to take the father's suggestion seriously and report it. The waiter's actions were inappropriate, and the mom's response was a balance between social etiquette and protecting her child. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
