My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mom and her 4-year-old daughter at a restaurant.\n\nFirst, the mom's daughter is very talkative and tall for her age, so people might mistake her for older. A waiter gives her a compliment about being \"beautiful\" and later gives her cake as a \"secret.\" The mom made her daughter thank him, and now she's wondering if she was wrong to do so.\n\nSo, the main points here are the waiter's behavior and the mom's response. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mom, directly complimented the child with a term that might be inappropriate, and then gave her a gift without the parent's knowledge. The mom felt uncomfortable because she sensed something off in his tone and demeanor. She made her daughter thank him to handle the situation, but now she's second-guessing if she overreacted.\n\nFrom my understanding, parents have the right to protect their children and teach them appropriate social behavior. If the mom felt the waiter was being inappropriately flirtatious or creepy, she's within her rights to step in. Making the child thank him could be a way to assert control and ensure the child learns to respond politely, even when the parent is uncomfortable. The fact that the waiter didn't acknowledge the mom and treated the child as if she were an adult might be part of the issue. \n\nAlso, the waiter giving a free cake as a \"secret\" could be seen as trying to form a connection directly with the child, which is concerning. The mom's father-in-law thinks she should complain, which suggests that even others might see the waiter's actions as problematic.\n\nThe key here is whether the mom overstepped by making her daughter thank him. Since the mom was the parent present and responsible for her child's safety, her actions were likely protective. The compliment itself might be seen as harmless in some contexts, but combined with the other behaviors (ignoring the parent, the \"secret\" cake), it's reasonable for her to feel it was inappropriate. Therefore, the mom isn't in the wrong for her reaction. The answer should be B (No).\n"
