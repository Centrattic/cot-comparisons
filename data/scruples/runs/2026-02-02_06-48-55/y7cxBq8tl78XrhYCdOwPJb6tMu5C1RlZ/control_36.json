My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a single mom) is in the wrong after her 4-year-old daughter was treated in a way she found creepy by a waiter.\n\nFirst, the waiter gave the girl a compliment about being \"beautiful\" without acknowledging the mother. Then he gave her cake as a \"secret\" without including the mother. The mom made her daughter thank him, which made her uncomfortable because she thought he was inappropriately flirtatious.\n\nThe key points here: The mom felt the waiter's behavior was inappropriate. She acted to protect her daughter by making her respond, which is a common parental instinct. The waiter didn't address the parent, which is a red flag in such situations. Complimenting a young child on physical appearance, especially when it's done in a way that excludes the parent and makes the parent uncomfortable, can be a form of inappropriate attention. \n\nThe mom's actions were to ensure her daughter learned to be polite but also to set boundaries. The father's suggestion to complain is reasonable because the restaurant should address such behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for trusting her instincts and protecting her child. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
