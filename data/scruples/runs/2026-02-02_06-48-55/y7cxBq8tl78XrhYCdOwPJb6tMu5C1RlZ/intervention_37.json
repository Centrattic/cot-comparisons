My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where a waiter interacted with her daughter. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it.\n\nFirst, the context: the daughter is 4 years old but looks older. The waiter gave her a compliment saying she's beautiful, didn't acknowledge the mother, then later gave her a free cake and told it's a secret. The mother made her daughter say thank you, which made her feel like she let her down. The father suggests complaining.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe waiter's behavior: complimenting a young child on her appearance, not addressing the parent, giving a secret free item. The mother felt uncomfortable because of the tone and look, which she associates with creeps. The author made her daughter thank him, which she later questions.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, ensuring the child's safety and comfort is crucial. The waiter's actions could be seen as inappropriate for a child, especially the secret part. The mother's intuition to be cautious is valid. Making the daughter thank him might have been to maintain politeness, but the mother's discomfort is justified. The act of giving the cake as a secret could be seen as trying to create a bond without the parent's knowledge, which is concerning.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on this analysis, the mother's actions were protective. The author is not in the wrong for trusting her instincts and wanting to set boundaries. The waiter's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory, especially targeting a young child without parental involvement. The parent's decision to make the child thank him might have been to address immediate politeness, but the underlying concern is valid. The father's suggestion to complain is reasonable as the restaurant might need to address the staff's behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
