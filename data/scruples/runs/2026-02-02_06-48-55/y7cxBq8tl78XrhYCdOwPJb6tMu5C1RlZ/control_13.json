My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a mother and her 4-year-old daughter at a restaurant. The waiter compliments the daughter on her beauty and gives her a slice of cake without the mother's knowledge. The mother made her daughter thank him, and now she's wondering if she did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter is very gregarious and tall, so she might be mistaken for older. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mother and addressed the daughter directly with a compliment. The mother felt uncomfortable because of the tone and the word choice. She made her daughter thank him, and later the waiter gave her a free cake, telling her it's a secret. The father suggests complaining, but the mother is unsure.\n\nThe question is whether the mother is in the wrong. The main issues here are the mother's response and whether her actions were appropriate. The mother felt the waiter was being a creep, so making her daughter thank him could be seen as contradictory to her intuition. However, teaching manners is important. But in this case, the compliment was inappropriate, so expecting a thank you might be problematic. Also, the waiter not acknowledging the mother and treating the daughter in a way that made the mother uncomfortable is a red flag. The mother's decision to make the daughter thank him might have been an attempt to teach politeness, but it's possible she felt conflicted because she thought the waiter was inappropriate. \n\nFrom a child safety perspective, the mother's intuition to be alert to potential predators is valid. The waiter's behavior (not acknowledging the parent, giving secrets, complimenting as \"beautiful\") could be signs of grooming. In that case, the mother's discomfort is justified. Therefore, making the daughter thank him might have been a moment of conflict between her instincts and social norms. However, she did later consider complaining, which suggests she's aware of the situation's sensitivity. The answer likely leans towards the mother not being in the wrong because the waiter's behavior was concerning, and she acted based on her instincts to protect her child. The key here is the appropriateness of the waiter's actions versus the mother's response. So the answer is B (No), the mother is not in the wrong.\n"
