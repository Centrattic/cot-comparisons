My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a single mother) is in the wrong for being creeped out by a waiter's behavior towards her 4-year-old daughter and for making her say thank you. The story is from a Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The mother took her daughter to a family-run caf\u00e9 they've been to before. The daughter is gregarious and tall for her age, often mistaken for older. She interacted with a man waiting for his takeaway, who seemed a bit uncomfortable but handled it well. Then, the waiter started looking at the daughter and giving her compliments. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mother, called the daughter \"beautiful,\" which the mother found inappropriate. The daughter didn't respond, so the mother made her say thank you. Later, the waiter gave the daughter a free piece of cake without telling the mother, calling it a secret. The mother is now questioning if she overreacted, made her daughter uncomfortable, and if she should complain.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are asking for my opinion. They want a simple answer: A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The waiter's behavior: complimenting a child as \"beautiful\" might be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's directed solely at the child without acknowledging the parent, and then giving a secret gift. The mother felt uncomfortable because of her life experience, which is valid. Making the daughter thank him\u2014was that wrong? The mother's intention was to teach politeness, but the compliment itself could be creepy. However, the daughter didn't respond, so the mother intervened. The mother's discomfort is understandable, and her concern for her daughter's safety is valid. The waiter's actions could be seen as predatory, especially the secret cake part. The father's suggestion to complain is reasonable. \n\nSo, the mother is not in the wrong. The waiter's actions were inappropriate, and the mother acted in her daughter's best interest. Making the daughter say thank you was a way to handle the situation politely while also ensuring the daughter knew to respond, but the mother's real action was addressing the potential creep. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
