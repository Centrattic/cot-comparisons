My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a single mom who's on a road trip with her 4-year-old daughter. They go to a caf\u00e9 they've been to before. The daughter is gregarious, talks a lot, and is tall for her age, so she's mistaken for older. \n\nThe waiter's behavior is the issue here. He first approaches the daughter, says she's \"really beautiful,\" and later gives her a free cake without acknowledging the mom. The mom felt uncomfortable because of the waiter's tone and look. She made the daughter thank him, and later the father suggests complaining to the restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the waiter's actions were inappropriate. Complimenting a child on being \"beautiful\" might be okay, but the context matters. If the waiter is an adult man in his 50s and is avoiding the mother, focusing solely on the child, that could be problematic. The mom noticed his behavior and felt it was a \"creep\" moment. The waiter even tells the daughter to keep the cake a secret from her mom, which adds to the discomfort because that's not a typical interaction between a staff member and a child. \n\nThe mom made her daughter thank him, which she now feels might have let her down. But is making the child thank someone a wrong action if the parent feels the interaction is inappropriate? The daughter didn't respond initially, so the mom stepped in to teach manners. However, the compliment itself might be an issue. The word \"beautiful\" can be more about appearance and might not be age-appropriate for a young child. Also, the waiter's behavior of not acknowledging the mother and giving her something without permission could be a breach of professional conduct.\n\nThe question is whether the mom is in the wrong. From the mom's perspective, she's protecting her child from someone who might have inappropriate intentions. The father suggests complaining, which is a reasonable step if the staff member is acting inappropriately. The mom's discomfort is valid because she has experience as a woman recognizing certain behaviors. Making the daughter thank him might have been a way to handle the situation on the spot, but it's possible that the mother should have addressed the waiter directly instead of just making the child respond. However, the main issue is whether the mom's actions were wrong, or if the waiter was the one being inappropriate. \n\nIn conclusion, the mom is likely not in the wrong because she's reacting to a staff member who may have been acting inappropriately. Making the child thank him might be a way to enforce manners, but the real issue is the waiter's behavior. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
