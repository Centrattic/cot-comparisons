My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a waiter complimenting the author's 4-year-old daughter on her beauty, not addressing the mother, and later giving her a free cake as a \"secret.\" The author made her daughter thank the waiter and is considering whether she was right to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The main points here are the author's actions: making the daughter thank the waiter despite feeling uncomfortable. The key issue is the appropriateness of the waiter's behavior and the mother's response.\n\nThe waiter's actions could be seen as inappropriate. Complimenting a young child on their beauty, especially in a way that bypasses the parent, might be crossing a line. The phrase \"beautiful\" could be seen as objectifying, and the waiter not acknowledging the mother at all might be a red flag. Adding a free cake as a \"secret\" is also concerning and could be a way to create a bond without the parent's knowledge, which is suspicious.\n\nThe author's response was to make her daughter thank the waiter. While it might seem contradictory to thank someone who made her uncomfortable, from a parenting perspective, teaching the child to be polite and to respond to compliments is important. However, the author was uncomfortable and felt the waiter was \"creepy.\" The act of making the child thank him could be seen as forcing the child to engage in a social interaction that the parent found unsettling. But it's also about teaching the child to respond appropriately in social situations, even if the parent is uncomfortable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were in part due to the waiter's behavior that made her uncomfortable. The author's father also thinks she should complain. The key here is that the waiter's behavior was likely inappropriate, and the mother's response was protective. Making the child thank him could be seen as a way to maintain composure and teach politeness, but the mother's discomfort is valid. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because the waiter's actions were questionable, and the mother was acting in her child's best interest by both protecting her and teaching her social norms. The act of making the child thank him might not be wrong if the mother is balancing her discomfort with the need to model appropriate behavior. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
