My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for being creeped out by a waiter's behavior towards her 4-year-old daughter and making her say thank you.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is very talkative and tall, often mistaken for older. The waiter compliments her on her beauty, ignores the mom, gives her cake secretly. The mom felt uncomfortable and made her daughter thank him. The dad thinks she should have complained.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the mom was wrong. Let's consider key points.\n\n1. **Safety and Comfort of the Child**: The mom felt the waiter's behavior was inappropriate. His direct compliment of \"beautiful\" and ignoring the parent is a red flag. Adults shouldn't make a child feel uncomfortable, especially without parental acknowledgment.\n\n2. **Teaching the Child**: Making the child thank him might seem odd, but the mom is protecting her daughter. She's teaching her to respond politely but also aware of the situation. However, making a child thank someone for a compliment that the parent finds creepy could be confusing. But the parent's role is to protect, so maybe it's justified.\n\n3. **Appropriateness of the Compliment**: The term \"beautiful\" for a 4-year-old, especially from a stranger, can be creepy. The waiter's tone and ignoring the parent adds to that. The mom's intuition here is valid.\n\n4. **Aftermath with the Cake**: The waiter bringing an unasked-for gift and telling the child not to tell the mom is definitely a boundary issue. This could be grooming behavior.\n\n5. **Parental Responsibility**: The mom is acting on her instincts as a parent. The father's advice to complain is reasonable, but the initial action of teaching the child to respond isn't wrong. The parent should prioritize the child's safety and comfort.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the waiter was just being friendly and overstepped, but the mom's perception is valid. The key is that her feelings and actions are protective. Also, the child is too young to understand the creepiness, so the parent's role is to interpret and act on that.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The mom's actions were protective and appropriate given her discomfort and the waiter's behavior.\n"
