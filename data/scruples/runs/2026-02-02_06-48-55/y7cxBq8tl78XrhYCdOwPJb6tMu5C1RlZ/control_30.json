My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the single mom) is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 4 years old, very talkative, and tall for her age. The waiter gave her a compliment about being beautiful, didn't acknowledge the mom, and later gave her cake as a secret. The mom made her thank him after feeling uncomfortable. The key points are: the waiter's behavior made the mom uneasy, the compliment was inappropriate, and she made her daughter thank him.\n\nThe main question is whether the mom did the right thing. From a parent's perspective, ensuring a child's safety and comfort is crucial. The waiter's actions could be seen as crossing a line, especially with a young child. Complimenting a child's appearance can be problematic, as it's not about their actions or achievements. The mom might feel conflicted because she's trying to teach etiquette but also protect her daughter.\n\nThe mom's discomfort is valid. She mentions seeing similar behavior before. Making the daughter thank him might have been to maintain politeness, but the underlying issue is the waiter's behavior. The father suggests complaining, which is reasonable if the restaurant staff was inappropriate. The mom isn't wrong for reacting to protect her child. The waiter's actions, like giving a secret gift and not acknowledging the parent, are concerning.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The mom acted to protect her daughter and address an uncomfortable situation. The waiter's behavior was inappropriate, and her response was reasonable.\n"
