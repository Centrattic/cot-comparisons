My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a single mom who felt uncomfortable with how a waiter interacted with her 4-year-old daughter. The key points here are the waiter's behavior and the mother's response.\n\nFirst, the waiter approached the daughter directly with a compliment about her being \"beautiful.\" The mother felt the tone and manner were inappropriate. She made her daughter thank him even though she felt uncomfortable. Then the waiter gave the daughter a free cake without acknowledging her. The mother is questioning if she was at fault for making her daughter thank the waiter, thinking he might be a creep.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and safety. Complimenting a young child can be innocent, but when it's about physical appearance and done in a way that makes the parent uncomfortable, red flags might be there. The waiter didn't address the parent, which could be seen as trying to connect with the child without parental presence, which is concerning. The mother's instinct to protect her child is natural. Making the daughter thank him might seem like enforcing politeness, but the mother's discomfort is valid. She's responsible for her child's safety, so her reaction isn't wrong. The fact that the waiter ignored the parent and gave a secret gift adds to the concern about his intentions.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong, but based on the analysis, the mother's actions were protective. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
