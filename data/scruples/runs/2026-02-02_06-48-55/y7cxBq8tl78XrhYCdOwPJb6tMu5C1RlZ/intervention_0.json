My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a single mom taking her 4-year-old daughter to a restaurant. The waiter compliments the child's beauty and gives her a cake as a secret, not acknowledging the mom. The mom made the child thank him, and now she's questioning if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the waiter's behavior. He addressed the child directly, complimented her on her looks, and gave her a gift without the parent's knowledge. The mother felt uncomfortable and made the child respond. The father suggests complaining, but the mom is unsure if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's break it down. The waiter's actions: complimenting a young child on her beauty can be seen as inappropriate, especially given the parent's intuition about his tone and behavior. The waiter also bypassed the parent, which can be concerning because parents typically want to be involved in their child's interactions with others.\n\nThe mother's response: making the child say thank you. But she felt uncomfortable, so forcing gratitude in that context might not be supportive. The child was looking at her phone and didn't respond initially. The mother had to intervene. The question is whether making the child thank someone who made her uncomfortable is wrong.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, parents should protect their kids from potentially creepy behavior. The mother's discomfort is valid, and her action to teach politeness might conflict with her instinct to shield the child. However, making a child thank someone they find odd or uncomfortable could be confusing. The mother's actions might be seen as a conflict between teaching etiquette versus protecting her child.\n\nThe father's suggestion to complain is reasonable because the waiter's behavior could be inappropriate. The mother's hesitation might stem from guilt over making the child thank the man. But ultimately, the restaurant's responsibility is to ensure a safe environment for all customers, including children. The mother isn't in the wrong for being protective or for responding to her instincts about the waiter's behavior. Her actions are more about concern for her child's safety than being at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the waiter's questionable behavior and the mother's valid concerns as a parent.\n"
