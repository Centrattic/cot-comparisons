My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being creeped out by how a waiter treated her daughter and making her say thank you. The situation involves a single mom and her 4-year-old daughter at a family restaurant.\n\nFirst, the waiter gives a compliment to the daughter, calling her \"beautiful,\" which the mom finds inappropriate. The waiter also gives the daughter a slice of cake as a \"secret,\" not acknowledging the mom. The mom made her daughter thank him, which she later questions if it was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the waiter's actions and the mom's response. The daughter is very young, even if she looks older. Complimenting a child's appearance can be problematic, especially when directed at a young girl. The waiter's behavior of not addressing the mom and treating the child as if they share a secret could be seen as crossing boundaries. \n\nThe mom's discomfort is valid because she's experienced as a woman and recognizes the body language and tone as something she's seen before. Making the child thank him might seem like enforcing politeness, but the compliment itself was uncomfortable. However, the mom is trying to teach her daughter manners, which is a common parenting approach. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014the waiter's actions were creepy, the daughter was too young to understand the situation, and the mom's intuition that this was inappropriate\u2014the mom's actions in making her daughter thank him might be seen as a way to handle the situation gracefully while also ensuring the child learns to be polite. However, the mom's decision to not confront the waiter immediately (as her father suggests) might be questioned. \n\nBut the main question is whether the mom is in the wrong. The waiter's behavior was the issue, not the mom's response. She was protecting her daughter and responding to a situation she found uncomfortable. So the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
