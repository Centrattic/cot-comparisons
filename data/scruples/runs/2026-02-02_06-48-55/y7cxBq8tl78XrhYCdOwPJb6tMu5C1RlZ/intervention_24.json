My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent reacting to a waiter's behavior towards their daughter. The parent made their daughter thank the waiter even though they felt uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the waiter's actions: he called the daughter \"beautiful\" directly, didn't acknowledge the parent, and later gave her cake as a \"secret.\" The parent felt creeped out because of the tone and the way he looked. The daughter is 4.5 years old, tall for her age, but still a child. The parent is concerned that the waiter might be inappropriately interested. \n\nThe parent made her daughter thank him, which the parent now questions if they were wrong. The key points here are consent and the parent's responsibility to protect their child. The parent's intuition that something was off is important. Even if the waiter didn't mean harm, the parent has the right to set boundaries for their child. Making the daughter thank him might have been awkward, but the parent's main role is to ensure their child's safety and well-being. The waiter's behavior could be seen as overstepping professional boundaries. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally not appropriate for an adult to give excessive attention to a child, especially without involving the parent. The parent's discomfort is valid. They also noticed the waiter's tone and expression, which they've experienced before as a woman, indicating possible predatory behavior. \n\nThe parent is a single mom, which might add to her vigilance. Her partner suggests complaining, which is a reasonable step. The parent's actions in making the daughter thank him might have been more about maintaining politeness than actually endorsing the behavior. So, the parent isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's safety and taking steps to address a potential issue. The main question is whether the parent overreacted. Given the waiter's actions, it's reasonable to not trust their intentions. Therefore, the answer is B \u2013 the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
