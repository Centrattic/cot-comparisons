My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is a single mom with a 4-year-old daughter. They're at a family-run caf\u00e9 they frequent. The daughter is very social and tall for her age, often mistaken for older. A waiter starts talking to her directly, skipping the mom. He compliments her on being \"beautiful,\" which the mom finds creepy because of the tone and his behavior. The waiter even gives the kid a free slice of cake without the mom's knowledge, telling the kid to keep it a secret. The mom made her daughter say thank you, and now she's wondering if she was wrong to do that and if she should have complained.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the waiter's actions. Complimenting a young child with \"beautiful\" might be seen as inappropriate because it's focusing on her appearance, and the waiter didn't acknowledge the mom. The mom felt uncomfortable, which is a valid reaction. The waiter's behavior of not addressing the parent and giving a secret to the child raises red flags. Parents usually expect staff to interact with them first, especially regarding their children.\n\nThe mom's actions: making her daughter thank the waiter. This could be seen as teaching the daughter to be polite in social situations. But since the mom found the interaction creepy, maybe making the child say thank you could send a mixed message. However, the mom's discomfort is justified, and she's protecting her daughter from someone who might be inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the mom was wrong to make her daughter thank him. On one hand, teaching gratitude is good. On the other, if the compliment was unwelcome, making the child respond might not be ideal. But the mom's primary responsibility is to protect her child, so her actions are more about handling the situation as a parent rather than forcing politeness. Also, the waiter's behavior is questionable, so the mom's reaction is reasonable.\n\nOthers might argue that adults should interact with the parent first, especially with children. The waiter's secrecy and lack of acknowledgment of the mom are concerning. The mom's father thinks she should complain, which is a valid point. The decision to complain is up to her, but she's not in the wrong for her immediate actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The waiter's behavior was inappropriate, and the mom's response was a way to handle the situation while protecting her daughter.\n"
