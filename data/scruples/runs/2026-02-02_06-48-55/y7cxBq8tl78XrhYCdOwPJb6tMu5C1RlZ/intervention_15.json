My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a single mom and her 4-year-old daughter at a restaurant. The waiter gives the daughter a compliment about her beauty and gives her a free cake, ignoring the mom. The mom made her daughter thank the waiter, which led to questions about whether that's appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The mom felt uncomfortable because the waiter's behavior seemed inappropriate. He addressed the child directly, used the word \"beautiful,\" and didn't acknowledge the mother. The mom's reaction was to make her daughter thank him, which is the part some might argue is wrong.\n\nBut from a child safety perspective, the mother's intuition that the waiter's behavior was off is crucial. She noticed the tone and look, which she had experience with as a woman. The waiter's actions\u2014ignoring the parent, giving a compliment that's more adult in nature, and giving a secret gift\u2014could be seen as crossing boundaries. The mom's response was to teach her daughter to respond politely, which might seem like she's endorsing the interaction, but in reality, she's handling it in a way that maintains the child's social etiquette while subtly protecting her.\n\nThe question is whether making the daughter thank him was wrong. If the mom felt the waiter was a creep, she might have been trying to maintain control of the situation without escalating it. Forcing a thank you could be seen as making the child acknowledge something that was uncomfortable, but the alternative might be a public confrontation, which isn't ideal in front of a child. \n\nAlso, the father's advice to complain is valid, as the restaurant should address such behavior. The mom might have chosen not to escalate then but is considering it now. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, teaching children to be polite is standard, but the context here is important. The mother's discomfort is a red flag, and her actions were to protect her daughter while keeping the situation manageable. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions were protective and appropriate given her concerns about the waiter's behavior.\n"
