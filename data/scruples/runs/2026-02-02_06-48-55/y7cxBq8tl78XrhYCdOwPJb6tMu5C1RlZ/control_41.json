My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a single mom and her 4-year-old daughter at a restaurant. The waiter compliments the daughter by calling her \"beautiful,\" which makes the mom uncomfortable. Then, the waiter gives the daughter a slice of cake secretly, not acknowledging the mom. The mom made her daughter thank him even though she felt the waiter was being creepy.\n\nFirst, the waiter's behavior raises some red flags. He didn't acknowledge the mom, addressed the child directly with a compliment about her appearance, and gave her a secret treat. The mom noticed his tone and expression, which she found uncomfortable. She's a woman with 35 years of experience, so she's probably attuned to these cues. The fact that he looked to her for reassurance when talking to the daughter earlier might indicate he was unsure about the appropriateness of their interaction.\n\nThe mom's reaction: she made her daughter thank him. But the daughter didn't respond initially, so the mom intervened. The key question is whether making the child thank someone who might be inappropriate is wrong. The mom's discomfort is valid, especially as a parent protecting her child. The waiter's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially targeting a young child. \n\nThe daughter is gregarious and tall, which might make adults interact with her more, but the waiter's approach is concerning. Complimenting a child's appearance can be inappropriate and might make the child feel objectified. The mom's instincts to protect her daughter are natural. \n\nThe father suggests complaining, which is reasonable given the situation. The mom might feel conflicted because she's enforcing politeness, but the context is creepy behavior. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her daughter's safety and comfort over strict politeness in this case. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding appropriately to a potentially inappropriate situation.\n"
