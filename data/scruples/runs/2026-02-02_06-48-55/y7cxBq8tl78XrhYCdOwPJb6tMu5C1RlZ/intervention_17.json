My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a mother feeling uncomfortable with how a waiter treated her 4-year-old daughter. The key points are the waiter's behavior: complimenting the child on her beauty, not acknowledging the mother, giving her an unasked-for cake, and treating it as a secret.\n\nFirst, the mother's perspective: she felt the interaction was creepy. She made her daughter say thank you, which she later questions. The father suggests complaining to the restaurant. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider the mother's actions. She made her daughter thank the waiter despite her discomfort. However, she had reasons: the waiter's tone and look felt off, using \"beautiful\" as a compliment on a child, not addressing her as a parent, and the secret cake. \n\nIs making the child thank someone inappropriate if the parent feels it's a creep? It's a tricky balance. The mother might be protecting her child from an uncomfortable situation. However, forcing gratitude could be confusing for the child. But the main issue is the waiter's behavior. The mother's response is a reaction to that. \n\nThe waiter's actions seem odd. Complimenting a young child on their beauty, ignoring the parent, and giving a secret treat could be seen as crossing boundaries. The mother's discomfort is valid, especially as a parent. She's trying to protect her child, so she's not in the wrong. The waiter's behavior is more questionable here. \n\nSo the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's responding to her child's safety and her own intuition about the waiter's conduct. Making the child thank him might be a parenting choice, but overall, her actions are protective.\n"
