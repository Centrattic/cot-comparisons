My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making her daughter thank the waiter after he said she was beautiful. \n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter is 4, very talkative, and the waiter gives a compliment that the mother found inappropriate. The mother made her daughter thank him, and later the waiter gave cake as a secret. The mother is a single parent, and the father thinks she should complain.\n\nThe mother feels uncomfortable because of the waiter's tone and choice of words. She made her daughter thank him, which she later questions if it was wrong. \n\nI need to consider if making the daughter thank the waiter was the wrong action. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mother and targeted the child directly with a compliment that the mother found creepy. The mother is trying to teach her daughter to be polite but is conflicted because she thinks the waiter was inappropriate. \n\nSocial norms suggest that adults should not make direct, flirty compliments to young children. The mother's discomfort is valid. By making her daughter thank the waiter, the mother might be reinforcing the idea that the compliment was acceptable, even if it was uncomfortable. However, the alternative could be teaching the daughter not to engage with strangers, but the mother might have wanted to maintain politeness. \n\nBut the key is whether the mother was wrong. The mother's intention was to model gratitude, but the situation was concerning. Maybe she should have explained the discomfort without forcing a thank you. However, in hindsight, she realizes it was a creep and questions if she let her daughter down. \n\nThe waiter's actions seem inappropriate. The mother's response was to teach gratitude, but maybe she should have addressed the inappropriate behavior instead. However, in the moment, she might not have known if the waiter was a creep. So, was she in the wrong? Probably not. She was trying to handle a situation where her daughter was being approached in a way she found odd. The act of making her daughter thank him might have been an overreaction if the waiter was indeed inappropriate, but the mother acted based on her perception. \n\nSo, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
