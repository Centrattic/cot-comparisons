My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for being creeped out by the waiter's behavior towards her daughter and for making her say thank you.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is 4 years old, very talkative, and the waiter gives her a compliment about being beautiful, ignores the mother, and later gives her cake as a \"secret.\" The mother feels uncomfortable and makes her daughter thank him.\n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of the waiter's actions. The compliment \"beautiful\" on a young child can be problematic because it's more about appearance, which can be unsettling. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mother, which might be a red flag since parents are usually the ones responsible for their children. Then, giving a free cake without the mother's knowledge and telling the daughter it's a secret adds to the creepiness.\n\nThe mother's reaction: She made her daughter thank him because she was uncomfortable. But the daughter was distracted, so the mother had to intervene. The mother is questioning if she was wrong to make the child thank someone she felt was a creep.\n\nLegally and socially, parents have the right to protect their children from inappropriate attention. Making a child thank someone who made the parent uncomfortable isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the parent is trying to teach gratitude while also being cautious. The mother's discomfort is valid given the situation's red flags. The father's suggestion to complain is also reasonable if the restaurant didn't address the behavior.\n\nSo, the mother isn't in the wrong. The waiter's behavior was inappropriate, and her response was protective. Answer B.\n"
