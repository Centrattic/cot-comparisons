My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person (a single mom) is in the wrong after making her daughter thank a waiter who came off as creepy. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the daughter is 4 years old but looks older. The waiter gives her a compliment about being beautiful, ignores the mom, and later gives her a secret cake slice. The mom felt uncomfortable and made her daughter thank him. Now she's wondering if she did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here. The waiter's behavior is questionable. He didn't acknowledge the mother, which is a red flag. Complimenting a young child on their beauty can be inappropriate, especially if it's done in a way that makes the parent uncomfortable. The waiter also gave a free cake and told the kid it's a secret, which adds to the creepiness.\n\nThe mom made her daughter thank him because she felt the waiter was being inappropriate. But the daughter didn't respond initially, so the mom intervened. The question is whether the mom was wrong to make her daughter thank a creep.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, protecting their child from uncomfortable situations is natural. The mom is in a tough spot because the waiter's actions are concerning. However, making the child thank someone who might be a predator could be seen as conflicting. On the other hand, the mom had no way of knowing for sure that the waiter was a predator at the time. She might have been trying to teach her daughter to be polite but felt conflicted afterward.\n\nAlso, the father suggests complaining to the restaurant. Maybe he's right because the waiter's behavior is unprofessional. But the mom's hesitation might come from not wanting to cause a scene or overreact. \n\nIn terms of the mom's own feelings, she's right to be uncomfortable. The waiter's behavior crosses boundaries, especially with a young child. Making her daughter thank him could be confusing for the child, especially if the mom later realizes the waiter was inappropriate. The mom might have felt she had to teach politeness but later regretted not addressing it directly with the staff.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the mom isn't in the wrong. She's responding to a situation that's uncomfortable and potentially harmful. Her actions were in her daughter's best interest, even if she's uncertain afterward. The waiter's behavior is the issue here, not the mom's reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
