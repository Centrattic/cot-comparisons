My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a waiter interacting with the author's 4-year-old daughter in a way that made the author uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the waiter addresses the daughter directly with a compliment about her beauty, ignoring the author. The daughter, who's engrossed in a phone game, doesn't respond. The author then makes her say thank you. Later, the waiter gives the daughter a free cake slice, again bypassing the author, and tells her it's their secret. The author is worried about the waiter being a creep and whether she was wrong to make her daughter thank him.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the waiter's actions and the mother's response. The author is a single mom, which might influence her protective instincts. The waiter's behavior\u2014focusing on the daughter's appearance, not acknowledging the parent, and giving a secret gift\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially with a young child. The mother's discomfort is valid because of the potential creepy undertones.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The mother didn't do anything wrong by making her daughter thank the waiter. The issue isn't with the mother's actions but with the waiter's conduct. Making a child respond to a compliment that makes the parent uncomfortable is a protective measure. The mother's actions were appropriate given her concerns. The waiter's behavior is the problem here, and the mother is justified in her response. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
