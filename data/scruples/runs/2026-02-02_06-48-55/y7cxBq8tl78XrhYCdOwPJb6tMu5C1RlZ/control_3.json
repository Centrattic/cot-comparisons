My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother is at fault for her actions in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the mother took her 4-year-old daughter to a family restaurant they frequent. The daughter is sociable and tall for her age, which might make others treat her differently. The waiter started complimenting the girl directly, using the word \"beautiful,\" which the mother found inappropriate. The mother made her daughter thank the waiter, even though she felt uncomfortable. Later, the waiter gave the girl a free slice of cake as a \"secret\" from the mother.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's judgment of the waiter's behavior and her response. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for feeling creeped out and making her daughter say thank you.\n\nFrom a general perspective, parents have the right to protect their children from uncomfortable or inappropriate interactions. The waiter's behavior, especially targeting a young girl and not acknowledging the mother, could be seen as crossing a boundary. Complimenting a child's appearance, particularly in a way that's direct and personal, can be problematic. The mother's discomfort is valid, especially given societal norms about how adults should interact with children.\n\nMaking the daughter thank the waiter might seem contradictory, but the mother's intent was to teach proper manners while also being cautious about the interaction. However, the mother later expressed discomfort with having to make her daughter acknowledge an uncomfortable compliment, which shows she's reflecting on her own actions. The fact that she's questioning her decision and considering feedback from her daughter's father adds nuance.\n\nThe waiter's behavior, including the secret slice of cake, could indicate he was trying to create a bond or connection that's not appropriate. The mother's response\u2014ensuring the daughter acknowledged him but also her later decision to potentially complain\u2014shows she's trying to protect her child.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mother's actions stem from a place of protecting her daughter. The waiter's actions are more questionable. The mother isn't in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable or taking steps to address the situation, even if her method (making the child thank) seems conflicting. The core issue is the waiter's behavior, not the mother's response. So the answer should be B, the mother is not in the wrong.\n"
