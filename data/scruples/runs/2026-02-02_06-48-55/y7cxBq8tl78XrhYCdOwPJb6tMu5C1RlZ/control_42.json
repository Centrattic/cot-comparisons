My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a waiter interacting with the author's 4-year-old daughter in a way that made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the daughter is very social and tall for her age, which might make some people treat her differently. The waiter first talks to her, then compliments her on being \"beautiful,\" ignores the mother when he should address her as well, gives the daughter a free cake without the mother's knowledge, and tells her it's a secret. The mother made the daughter say thank you, which is making her question if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the waiter's behavior. The mother is a single parent, and the waiter's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the age of the child. The mother felt uncomfortable, and the daughter was not in a position to understand the situation. Making the daughter thank the waiter might have been a way to handle the situation immediately, but the mother's discomfort is valid. The father thinks she should complain, which is a point to consider.\n\nBut the question is whether the mother is in the wrong. The mother acted in her daughter's best interest by ensuring she thanked the waiter, maybe to avoid confrontation at the moment. However, the waiter's behavior was questionable. The mother's hesitation and later discomfort might be justified. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. The waiter's actions were the main issue here. The mother's response was appropriate given the situation. She couldn't control the waiter's actions, but she made sure her daughter responded politely while also being aware of the potential creepiness. So, answer B (No).\n"
