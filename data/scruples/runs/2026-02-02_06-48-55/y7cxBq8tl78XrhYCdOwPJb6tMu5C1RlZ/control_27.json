My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a parent being creeped out by how a waiter treated their 4-year-old daughter. The parent made the daughter say thank you after the waiter gave a compliment that they found inappropriate. The parent is a single mom, and the father thinks she should complain.\n\nFirst, the waiter's behavior seems off. He didn't address the parent at all, focused solely on the child, gave a compliment using \"beautiful,\" and later gave a free cake as a \"secret.\" The parent felt uncomfortable with the tone and his actions. The parent made the child thank him because they felt it was necessary, even though they didn't like the compliment. \n\nI need to consider what's appropriate. Complimenting a child on their appearance can be tricky. While some might see it as harmless, the parent felt it was inappropriate, especially given the waiter's body language and the fact that he bypassed the parent. The parent's role is to protect their child, so making the child acknowledge the compliment might have been to model polite responses, but also to assert their presence and authority. \n\nThe parent's discomfort is valid. They've experienced similar situations before and recognized the look on the waiter's face. The fact that the waiter didn't acknowledge the parent at all adds to the concern. The parent is trying to teach their daughter how to interact politely while also setting boundaries. \n\nIs there a wrong here? The parent is reacting to a perceived threat to their child's safety and well-being. The waiter's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially targeting a child and excluding the parent. The parent's response to make the child thank him could be seen as a way to handle the situation immediately, even if they later decide to address it with the restaurant. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. Their instincts to protect their child and ensure their safety are appropriate. The father's suggestion to complain is also reasonable. The parent isn't to blame for their reaction to a potentially creepy situation.\n"
