My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent (the author) was wrong in this situation. The parent felt uncomfortable with how a waiter interacted with their 4-year-old daughter. The waiter made several comments directed at the daughter, didn't acknowledge the parent, and even gave her a free cake as a \"secret.\" The parent made the daughter say thank you, which they later question if it was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is very gregarious and tall for her age, which might make adults interact with her as if she's older. The waiter's behavior, like not addressing the parent and focusing solely on the child, could be problematic. Complimenting a child as \"beautiful\" might not be appropriate, especially if the delivery or tone feels off. The parent's discomfort is valid here because they've experienced similar situations before.\n\nThe parent made the daughter thank the waiter. The question is whether that was wrong. Well, teaching children to be polite is part of parenting. Even if the parent found the interaction uncomfortable, making the child respond politely is a way to handle social interactions. However, the parent's instinct to protect their child is important. The fact that the father suggested complaining shows that there's a concern about the waiter's behavior crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the waiter's actions\u2014like not acknowledging the parent and giving a secret cake\u2014could be seen as trying to create a bond without the parent's knowledge. That's a red flag. The parent's response to make their daughter thank him was a way to handle the situation at the moment, but they might have also been right to later question that action. However, in the moment, teaching gratitude is part of parenting. The parent isn't in the wrong for ensuring their child responds politely, even if they felt uneasy. The real issue is the waiter's behavior, not the parent making their child thank him. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
