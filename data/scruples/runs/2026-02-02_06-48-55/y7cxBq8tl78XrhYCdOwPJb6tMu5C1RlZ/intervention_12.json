My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a waiter at a family-run caf\u00e9 said \"You're really beautiful\" to the author's 4-year-old daughter, who's tall and mistaken for older. The author made her say thank you, and later the waiter gave her a slice of cake as a \"secret.\" The author is uncomfortable because of the waiter's tone and behavior, and she's wondering if she overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the waiter's actions. Complimenting a child's appearance, especially using words like \"beautiful,\" can be seen as inappropriate. It's not just about the words but also the context. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mother at all, which is odd because usually, in a parent's presence, the adult would address the parent first. Also, the waiter's behavior of making a secret and giving the cake without the mother's knowledge could be a red flag.\n\nThe daughter is described as gregarious and tall, so maybe she's used to interacting with adults. But that doesn't mean it's okay for someone to make her the focus of a compliment that might be uncomfortable. The mother's reaction: making the daughter thank him. On the surface, it might seem like the mother is enforcing politeness, but if the mother felt the interaction was creepy, she might be trying to handle it in a way that doesn't alarm her daughter. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for making her thank someone she found creepy.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are the waiter's behavior, the mother's response, and the daughter's age. The mother's discomfort is valid, especially given her experience. Making the daughter say thank you could be seen as teaching her to respond politely even in uncomfortable situations, but maybe also as not protecting her from an inappropriate compliment. However, the mother did get her daughter's attention and explained the situation, so the child acknowledged the compliment. \n\nIs it wrong to make a child thank someone when the parent feels it's a creepy situation? The mother might be trying to model appropriate social behavior, but \"beautiful\" can be a problematic term for a young girl. Also, the waiter's insistence and secret could be concerning. The author's father suggests complaining, which is a common reaction if someone feels their child was in an unsafe situation.\n\nSo, I think the mother is not in the wrong. The waiter's actions were inappropriate, and she's protecting her daughter. Making her thank him is a way to handle it without causing a scene, but the mother's judgment is key here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
