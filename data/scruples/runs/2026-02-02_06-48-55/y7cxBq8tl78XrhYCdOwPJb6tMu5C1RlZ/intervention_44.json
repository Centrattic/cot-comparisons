My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a single mother and her 4-year-old daughter interacting with a waiter who makes them uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The waiter started by talking to the daughter, addressing the mother for reassurance, which he handled well. But then, when bringing the food, he directly called the daughter \"really beautiful\" without acknowledging the mother. The mother felt uncomfortable with the tone and the word choice. She made her daughter thank him, and later the waiter gave the daughter a free cake without the mother's knowledge, telling her it's their secret. The mother is a single parent, and her daughter's father suggests she should complain.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now seeking a second opinion. The task is to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, ensuring a child's safety and comfort is paramount. The waiter's behavior\u2014focusing solely on the daughter, using a compliment that's more appropriate for an adult, not acknowledging the mother, and later giving something without the mother's consent\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The mother's reaction to make her daughter thank him might be based on social norms, but if she felt it was a \"creep,\" she has a right to act. However, forcing a thank you might have confused the child, but it's also about teaching manners versus protecting from uncomfortable situations.\n\nLegally, there's no clear violation here unless there's harassment, which isn't stated. The father's suggestion to complain could be a way to prevent future issues. The question is whether the mother overreacted. Since the mother felt uncomfortable and had valid concerns about the waiter's behavior, she's not in the wrong. The waiter's actions, while not illegal, were likely making her uncomfortable as a parent. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
