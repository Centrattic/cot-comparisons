My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the single mom) is at fault for being creeped out by a waiter's behavior towards her 4-year-old daughter and making her say thank you.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is very talkative and tall for her age, which might make adults interact with her as if she's older. The waiter gives her a compliment about being beautiful, ignores the mom, gives her cake without acknowledging the mom, and tells her to keep it a secret. The mom feels uncomfortable because of the waiter's tone and behavior, and she makes her daughter thank him.\n\nNow, to assess if the mom is in the wrong. The key points here are the waiter's actions. Complimenting a child on their beauty can be problematic, especially coming from an adult in a position of authority or in a service role. The waiter didn't address the parent, which might indicate he was trying to connect directly with the child, which can be a red flag. Also, giving the cake as a \"secret\" is concerning because it could be a way to involve the child in something that's not appropriate.\n\nThe mom's reaction: she made the daughter thank him. But considering her discomfort and the potential creepiness of the waiter's actions, making the child thank him might have been a way to assert control and model appropriate behavior. However, the question is whether that action was wrong. \n\nIn many cases, when an adult behaves inappropriately towards a child, the parent has every right to be protective. The mom's discomfort is valid, especially given her experience as a woman. She might be shielding her daughter from someone who's acting inappropriately. The father's suggestion to complain is also reasonable, as the restaurant should address such behavior.\n\nSo, the mom isn't in the wrong. Her actions were protective, and the waiter's behavior was the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
