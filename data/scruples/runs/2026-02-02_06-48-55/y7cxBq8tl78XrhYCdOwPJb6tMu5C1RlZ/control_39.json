My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a single mom) is in the wrong after making her daughter thank a waiter who she felt was acting inappropriately. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 4 years old but looks older. The waiter gave her a compliment about being beautiful, didn't acknowledge the mom, and later gave the kid a free cake without the mom's knowledge. The mom felt uncomfortable because of the waiter's tone and behavior, which reminded her of creepiness. She made her daughter thank him, and now she's questioning if she was wrong to do so.\n\nSo, the main points here are the waiter's behavior. Complimenting a child on their beauty can be problematic because it's more about their appearance, which isn't age-appropriate and might make some people uncomfortable. The waiter also didn't address the mother, which could be a red flag. The mom's reaction was to make her daughter thank him, which the mom is now regretting because she's worried she let down her daughter by enforcing a thank you for something that made her uncomfortable.\n\nThe question is whether the mom is in the wrong. From a general perspective, if someone is acting inappropriately towards a child, the parent has a right to be cautious and protect their child. The mom's discomfort is valid, and she's trying to teach her daughter manners, but she's conflicted because the situation made her uncomfortable.\n\nThe waiter's actions could be seen as creepy because of the direct compliment on beauty, not addressing the parent, and the secret cake. The mom's response was to make her daughter thank him, but she's now questioning if that was wrong. However, in such cases, parents might choose to not reinforce the interaction if they feel it's inappropriate. Teaching a child to be polite in all situations is important, but also teaching them to be cautious around adults who make them uncomfortable is equally important.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the mom is not in the wrong. She's protecting her child and responding to a potentially uncomfortable situation. Her feelings are valid, and her actions, while maybe confusing, are in line with a parent's instinct to safeguard their child from questionable behavior.\n"
