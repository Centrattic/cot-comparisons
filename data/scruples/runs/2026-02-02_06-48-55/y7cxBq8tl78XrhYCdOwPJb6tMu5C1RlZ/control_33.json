My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is a single mom taking her 4-year-old daughter to a restaurant. The daughter is very talkative and seems older than she is. The waiter compliments the daughter on being \"beautiful\" and gives her a free cake, not acknowledging the mom. The mom made the daughter thank him even though she felt uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The mother's main concerns are her discomfort with the waiter's tone and the inappropriateness of the compliment. She also made her daughter thank him, which made her question if she did the right thing.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, any adult interacting with a child in a way that makes the parent uncomfortable should be a red flag. The waiter's behavior\u2014ignoring the parent, making a compliment that's more suited for an adult, and giving a secret gift\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The mom's instinct to protect her child is valid. Making the daughter thank him might seem like teaching gratitude, but in this context, it could be seen as forcing the child to engage with someone who made the parent uneasy. However, the mother's actions were in response to her own discomfort and trying to teach her daughter manners, even if she later felt conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the mother is in the wrong. The key here is the mother's right to protect her child and her judgment in that situation. Since the mother felt the waiter was a creep, her actions to set boundaries and potentially address the behavior (like complaining) are reasonable. The father's suggestion to complain is also valid because restaurants should be aware of any staff who behave inappropriately around children.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She had a valid reason to be uncomfortable and acted in her daughter's best interest.\n"
