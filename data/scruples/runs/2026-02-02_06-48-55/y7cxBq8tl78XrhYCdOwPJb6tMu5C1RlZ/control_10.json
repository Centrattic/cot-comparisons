My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a single mom takes her 4-year-old daughter to a restaurant. The daughter is talkative and tall for her age. A waiter compliments the kid on her beauty, ignores the mom, gives her cake without ordering, and tells her it's a secret. The mom made her daughter thank him. The question is whether the mom is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The waiter didn't acknowledge the mother, which is odd because parents are usually present and should be addressed. The compliment of \"beautiful\" might be inappropriate for a young child, especially if the tone or intent was off. The mom felt uncomfortable, which makes sense given the waiter's behavior. \n\nThen there's the part where the waiter gives the cake as a secret. That's a red flag because involving a child in a secret without the parent's knowledge can be dangerous. The mom made her daughter thank him, which could be seen as teaching her to respond politely even to unwanted attention. But is that wrong? The mom's intention was to protect her daughter but also teach etiquette. \n\nThe author is a single mom, which might add pressure, but her fatherly figure supports complaining. The author is worried she let the waiter down by making the kid thank him. But from the parent's perspective, it's about safety and setting boundaries. \n\nI think the key points are the waiter's inappropriate behavior (ignoring the parent, making a secret, complimenting a child in a way that's not age-appropriate) and the mom's reaction. The mom acted to ensure her daughter knew to respond politely, but she also felt the situation was creepy. Since the waiter's actions were concerning, the mom's response seems reasonable. So, the answer is probably B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
