My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a parent feeling creeped out by a waiter's behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the waiter didn't address the parent but spoke directly to the 4-year-old, calling her \"beautiful\" twice. The parent made the child thank him, which made the parent feel bad because they thought the waiter was a creep. The father suggests complaining, so the parent is conflicted.\n\nI need to consider the key points. The waiter didn't acknowledge the parent, which might be a red flag. Complimenting a child's appearance can be inappropriate, especially if done in a way that makes the parent uncomfortable. The parent's instinct is to protect their child, so making her thank the waiter might seem like enforcing politeness, but if the parent sensed something wrong, it's reasonable to act.\n\nLegally and socially, adults should be cautious about interacting with children in ways that make parents uneasy. The parent's reaction is about protecting their child from potential creepy behavior. The waiter's actions\u2014giving a free cake and treating it as a secret\u2014could be seen as manipulative or inappropriate. \n\nThe parent isn't in the wrong for trusting their instincts. They made their daughter thank the waiter to set a boundary, which is a way to teach gratitude but also to signal that the interaction isn't welcome. The fact that the parent felt uncomfortable and later decided to complain aligns with being cautious. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were protective and based on their intuition about the waiter's behavior.\n"
