My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being creeped out by a waiter's behavior towards her daughter and making her say thank you.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The daughter is 4.5 years old, very talkative, and the waiter gives her a compliment about being beautiful, ignores the mother, gives her cake as a \"secret,\" and doesn't acknowledge the mother. The mother feels uncomfortable because the waiter's tone and actions seem off.\n\nThe author is a single mom, so she's responsible for her daughter. She made her daughter thank the waiter, which she later questions. The father suggests complaining to the restaurant.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The waiter's actions: complimenting a very young child on her beauty, ignoring the parent, and giving her a gift as a \"secret.\" These are red flags. Complimenting a child's appearance can be inappropriate, especially if it's done in a way that excludes the parent. The mother's discomfort is valid given these actions.\n\nThe mother made her daughter thank him, but she's worried she let her down. However, forcing a thank you in that context might not be wrong, as the mother's priority is her child's safety. The father's suggestion to complain is reasonable since the waiter's behavior could be inappropriate or predatory.\n\nThe options are A (Author is wrong) or B (Not wrong). The key is whether the mother overreacted. The waiter's behavior is questionable, so the mother's response is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
