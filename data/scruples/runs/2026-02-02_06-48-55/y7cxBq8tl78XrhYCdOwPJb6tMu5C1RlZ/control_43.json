My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for making her daughter thank a waiter who made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the waiter addressed the daughter, who is 4 years old but looks older, directly with a compliment about her beauty. The mother noticed the waiter's behavior didn't seem right\u2014maybe his tone or the way he looked. Then he gave the daughter a cake without the mother's knowledge and told her it's a secret. The mother made her daughter thank him, which made her feel like she's letting her daughter down.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's intuition about the waiter's intentions. She felt uncomfortable because of his behavior, which included not acknowledging her and making a comment about the daughter's beauty. The waiter's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially since he tried to bypass the mother and create a private bond with the child.\n\nThe mother's decision to make her daughter thank him might seem conflicting, but she was acting on her gut feeling that something was off. The father suggests complaining, which makes sense if the staff's behavior was indeed inappropriate. The mother's priority here is her child's safety and well-being, so her actions are protective.\n\nIn terms of the compliment, telling a young child they're beautiful can be a problem. It's more about their character than appearance, and the context here was unsettling. The waiter's behavior\u2014like the secret cake\u2014adds to the concern. The mother isn't in the wrong for trusting her instincts and protecting her daughter from a potentially creepy situation. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
