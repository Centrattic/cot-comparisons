My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for making her daughter thank a waiter who made her uncomfortable. The scenario involves the waiter giving a compliment that felt inappropriate and then giving the kid a free cake without the parent's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The waiter didn't address the mom and directly told the 4-year-old she was beautiful. The mom felt that the tone and look on his face were off, which made her uncomfortable. She made her daughter say thank you, which she later regrets because the compliment felt inappropriate. The father advises her to complain, but she's unsure if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the waiter's behavior inappropriate? If so, was it right for the mom to make her daughter thank him despite her discomfort? The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nIn terms of the waiter's behavior, complimenting a child on their beauty can be a red flag. Especially when he bypasses the parent and talks directly to the child, not acknowledging the mother. The part where he says it's their secret and gives a free cake without the parent's knowledge is definitely concerning. That seems like overstepping boundaries.\n\nThe mom's actions: She made her daughter thank him. Even though she felt uncomfortable, she made her child respond. The question is whether that was wrong. Some might argue that the mom should have taught her daughter to say thank you regardless, while others might say that forcing gratitude for something that felt creepy could be harmful.\n\nBut the mom's concern is valid. The situation could be a red flag for inappropriate behavior. By making her daughter thank him, she might have inadvertently validated the waiter's actions, which could confuse the child. However, the mom was also trying to navigate a situation where her child was being singled out in a way that felt off. She might have been unsure how to handle it at the moment, leading her to make the child respond as a way to manage the interaction.\n\nThe father's advice to complain is sound because if the waiter is acting inappropriately, the restaurant should be informed. The mom might feel guilty for not acting sooner, but her immediate action was to handle the situation as it happened. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's more about the judgment call she made in the moment. Since the waiter's behavior was questionable, the mom's discomfort is justified. Forcing gratitude in an uncomfortable situation isn't ideal, but the main issue is the waiter's behavior, not the mom's reaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
