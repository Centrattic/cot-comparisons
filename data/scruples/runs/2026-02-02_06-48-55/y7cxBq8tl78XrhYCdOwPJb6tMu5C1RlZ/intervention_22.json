My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for being creeped out by a waiter's behavior toward her 4-year-old daughter and making her say thank you.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The daughter is very outgoing and tall, often mistaken for older. The waiter gave her a compliment about being beautiful, didn't acknowledge the mom, then later gave her a free cake as a \"secret.\" The mom felt uncomfortable because of the tone and looked, and made her daughter thank him.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, child safety, and appropriate interactions. The waiter's behavior might be concerning. Complimenting a child on their appearance, especially in a way that's not age-appropriate, can be problematic. The waiter also didn't address the mother, which can make a parent uneasy. Giving a secret to the child without the parent's knowledge is another red flag.\n\nThe mom's actions: making her daughter thank him. But she felt the waiter was a \"creep,\" so she had reasons. However, forcing a child to thank someone in that context could be confusing for the child. But the mom's primary responsibility is to protect her child. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. The waiter's actions were inappropriate, and the mom had the right to intervene. Making the daughter thank him might be a parenting decision to teach manners, but the underlying issue is the waiter's behavior. The mother isn't wrong for being cautious and taking her father's advice to complain. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The waiter's actions were the issue, not the mom's response to protect her child.\n"
