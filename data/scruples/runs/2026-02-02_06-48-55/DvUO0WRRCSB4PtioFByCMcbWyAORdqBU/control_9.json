      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids, is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: they've been married 6 years, together 10. Wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young kids (4 and 1.5 years old). The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so most of the parenting and housework falls on the wife. On weekends, he does pitch in, spending time with the kids and helping out. This time, he went away Thursday to Sunday, which is 4 days, for a music festival with a friend. His wife is exhausted and feels like she didn't get a break, and she's upset that he left her with the kids for that long.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLooking at the situation, the key points are: the wife is already handling most of the parenting and housework during the week because the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. On weekends, he helps out, but this time he's not there. The trip is 4 days, which the wife clearly finds too much. The husband feels guilty but thinks it's a once-a-year break for him.\n\nI need to consider if leaving the wife with the kids for 4 days is reasonable. With two young children, especially a 1.5-year-old, the demands are high. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, so she's already dealing with the kids full-time. The husband's absence for four days means she's not only managing the kids but also the housework without any help. Even if he helps on other weekends, this specific absence might be overwhelming.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important here. She's expressed that 4 days is too much and that he made a wrong decision. Her exhaustion is a valid concern. The husband's need for a break is understandable, but the impact on his wife's well-being and stress levels might outweigh his personal time. The fact that he left during a weekend when he usually helps could be seen as neglecting his shared responsibilities, especially since the wife is already shouldering most of the load. \n\nAdditionally, the duration of the trip (Thursday to Sunday) covers most of the weekend, which is when the wife might have a much-needed break. By leaving her alone during that time, he's removing a potential opportunity for her to rest, which she's already told him is important. The husband's reasoning that it's only once a year might not account for the cumulative stress and his wife's current state of being exhausted.\n\nSo, while the husband might have had good intentions, the impact on his wife's workload and mental health could make him at fault for not considering her needs enough. The key is the balance between personal time and shared responsibilities. If the husband's absence significantly affects his wife's ability to cope, then he might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
