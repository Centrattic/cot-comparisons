      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife who's a stay-at-home parent with two young kids. The wife is clearly struggling because she's exhausted and doesn't get a break. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, but on weekends he helps out. This time, he's going away for four days, which the wife feels is too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife is the primary caregiver and housekeeper, which is a significant responsibility, especially with two young children. The husband works long hours, so maybe he's already not around much during the week. The fact that he usually helps on weekends is a positive, but leaving for four days might disrupt that support system. \n\nThe wife has made it clear that she's upset and feels it's the wrong decision. Since they're married, communication is key. The husband might feel he needs some personal time, but the wife's needs and well-being are also important. The children are very young, so having both parents present is crucial for their emotional stability and care. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that he needs a break to recharge, and it's only once a year. However, the fact that the wife is already overwhelmed and the trip is four days long could make it a heavier burden on her. The husband's justification of \"one weekend away in the year\" might not account for the cumulative stress on his wife. \n\nI should consider whether the husband took his wife's feelings into account before making the decision. If he discussed it and she still didn't agree, maybe he should have found a compromise. But if he went ahead without proper communication, that's a problem. However, the post says the wife made it clear she's upset after the decision was made. \n\nIn relationships, it's about balance and mutual respect. If the husband's absence causes significant stress for his wife, especially when she's already stretched thin, then he might be in the wrong. The children's needs also play a role here. A four-day absence might be too much for her to handle alone. \n\nSo, the husband should have considered his wife's perspective more carefully. Even if it's a rare opportunity for him, the impact on his wife and kids might be more significant. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). However, if the husband had discussed it and tried to make arrangements to support his wife, maybe it's different. But based on the info given, it seems he didn't account for her feelings adequately.\n"
