      "text": "\nOkay, let me think through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife to handle the kids alone.\n\nFirst, the wife is a stay-at-home parent for two children, aged 4 and 1.5. That's tough work, especially with a toddler. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so he's already not around much. On weekends, he usually helps with parenting and housework, which is good. But this time, he's going away for four days. \n\nHe mentions it's been hard on his wife, who's exhausted from the week. The trip is once a year, but the wife says four days is too much and the husband made the wrong decision. He does feel bad about it. \n\nI need to consider the balance of responsibilities. If the husband typically pitches in on weekends, then taking off for four days might leave his wife without that support, especially when she's already tired. The fact that she's a stay-at-home parent means she's handling all the childcare and housework during the week, and the husband's absence over the weekend could add to her stress. \n\nEven though it's a once-a-year trip, the key issue is communication and considering his wife's feelings and workload. The husband might not have realized how much his weekend help is a relief for her. If he left without a clear plan or if it was a last-minute decision, that could make things worse. But the post doesn't mention if they discussed the trip beforehand or if there was a compromise. \n\nThe wife made it clear that four days is too much, so the husband should have respected her feelings. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. The husband's need for a break is valid, but so is the wife's need for support. Maybe they could have found a middle ground, like a shorter trip or arranging some help. \n\nSo, even if the trip is a rare opportunity, the husband might be in the wrong because he didn't account for his wife's exhaustion and the usual support she relies on. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
