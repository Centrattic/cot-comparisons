      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home mom, and he already works long hours and sometimes travels. On weekends, he helps with the kids and chores.\n\nSo the situation is that he decided to go for a 4-day music festival, which his wife is upset about because she's already exhausted and now has to handle everything alone. The user wants to know if he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, so she already has a full load. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, which means she's used to handling most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, he usually helps, which is good. But this time, he's leaving for four days, which the wife finds too much. \n\nThe husband feels bad but thinks it's once a year. However, the key point is that the wife explicitly said it's too much and the decision was wrong. That's a strong indicator that his absence is adding to her stress. Even if he's only doing it once a year, if it's causing significant strain on his wife, maybe he should reconsider. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's taking time off for a music festival while she's dealing with two young kids (4 and 1.5 years old) might be seen as selfish. Young children require a lot of attention and care, and being without a parent for four days could be really tough. The wife might be overwhelmed. \n\nBut there's also the balance of personal time. The husband might need a break too. However, since he's already working long hours and sometimes traveling, maybe the wife is the primary caregiver and needs support. The fact that he's usually there on weekends shows he's trying to help, but this time he's not. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. Did he discuss this with his wife beforehand? If he did and she still objected, then he's ignoring her feelings. The wife's well-being is important, and if she's exhausted, adding to her workload without support isn't fair. \n\nSo, even though he might think it's a small trip, the impact on his wife is significant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's stress and workload. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
