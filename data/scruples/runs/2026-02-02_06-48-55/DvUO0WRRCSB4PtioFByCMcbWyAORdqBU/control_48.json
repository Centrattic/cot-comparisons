      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids, is in the wrong. The wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young children, ages 4 and 1.5. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, but on weekends he usually helps with the kids and housework. This time, he went away for a four-day music festival, from Thursday to Sunday. The wife is exhausted and feels he made a wrong decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities each partner has. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework all week, and the husband is working long hours. On weekends, he usually pitches in, which is good. But by leaving for four days, he's not there to help during that time. The kids are very young, especially the 1.5-year-old, who would need a lot of attention. \n\nThe husband argues it's just one weekend a year, but the wife is clearly upset and feels the strain. Even though he's trying to take a break for himself, the impact on his wife might be significant. Relationships require balance and consideration. If the wife is already overwhelmed, then taking away her support (the husband) for four days could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, communication is key. Did the husband and wife discuss this before he made the trip? If he didn't consider her feelings and the existing workload, that's a problem. Even if he felt he needed a break, maybe he should have arranged for help or found a shorter time away. The fact that he's leaving her with no support over the weekend, when she's already exhausted, might tip the balance in her favor. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone needs some personal time. But in this case, the duration is four days, which is quite long. It's not just the time away but the fact that the wife is left alone with two young kids when she's already struggling. The husband's work schedule might mean he's not always there, but on weekends he usually helps. Skipping all weekend support could be the issue here. \n\nSo, considering the wife's perspective and the impact on her, the husband might be in the wrong for not fully considering her situation. He should have perhaps found another way to recharge without leaving her in such a difficult spot. Therefore, the answer would be AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
