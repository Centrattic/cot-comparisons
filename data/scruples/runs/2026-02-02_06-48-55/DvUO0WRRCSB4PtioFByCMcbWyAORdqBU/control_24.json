      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife to handle the kids alone.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been married 6 years, together 10. Wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young kids (4 and 1.5 years old). The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so during weekends he helps with parenting and housework. This time, he went to a 3-day music festival, Thursday to Sunday. The wife is exhausted and feels she doesn't get a break. She thinks 4 days is too much, so he made the wrong decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's at fault. \n\nOn one side, he does help during weekends, which is important for a stay-at-home parent. But he's leaving her to manage the kids alone for three days. The kids are very young, especially the 1.5-year-old, which is a demanding age. Parenting a toddler and a preschooler without support for four days could be overwhelming. The wife is already stressed from the week and doesn't get a break. \n\nThe husband feels bad but justifies it as a one-time break. But the wife's perspective is that it's too much. The key here is communication. Did he consider her feelings beforehand? If he went without considering her workload, that's a problem. Also, the duration\u2014four days is a long time for a parent who's already stretched thin. Even though he's not taking the kids, the responsibility is all on her. \n\nOn the other hand, he's working long hours and maybe needs a break too. But he's the one with the higher earning potential (since the wife is a stay-at-home parent), so he should be the one to take the vacation. However, the timing and duration might be an issue. Four days is a significant time away, especially when the kids are young. Maybe a shorter trip or arranging for help could have been a better solution. \n\nThe wife's reaction is valid because she's under a lot of stress. The husband didn't consider her capacity to handle the situation, which shows a lack of empathy. The fact that he's gone for four days and she's left alone might make her feel isolated. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to consider each other's workloads and support each other. If the husband's absence adds to her stress without prior agreement or support, then he's in the wrong. The fact that he's gone for the entire weekend and she doesn't get a break suggests that he didn't balance the household responsibilities adequately. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he prioritized his own break over his wife's well-being and the practical challenges she faces, without considering her needs and the children's.\n"
