On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends while leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, they have two young children, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps with the kids and housework.\n\nSo the husband is going away for four days, from Thursday to Sunday, which is a music festival. The wife is exhausted because she's handling everything both during the week and the weekend. He feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year break. The wife is upset and says he made the wrong decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. That already puts a strain on the wife, who's the primary caregiver. On weekends, the husband usually helps out, but this time he's leaving for four days. The wife is clearly overwhelmed, and this trip adds to her burden. \n\nThe key points here are the duration of the trip and the wife's current stress level. Four days is a significant amount of time, especially when the kids are young and require constant care. The husband's usual help is crucial during weekends, so his absence might exacerbate the wife's workload. Even if it's a rare trip, the wife's feelings and the situation need to be considered. \n\nThe husband mentions that he feels bad but justifies it as a one-time event. However, the wife's clear reaction shows that this decision has a significant negative impact on her. Communication is important here. The husband might not have considered how the trip would affect her, especially if there's no prior discussion about taking such breaks. \n\nOn the other hand, it's understandable that the husband needs some time off. Work-life balance is important for both partners. But with a stay-at-home parent and young children, the husband's availability during weekends is vital. Leaving for four days might not be feasible without causing strain. \n\nAnother angle is whether there was any prior agreement or if the husband considered alternative ways to manage. If there was no plan to arrange help for the wife during his trip, that's a problem. The husband's decision to go without ensuring support for his wife might be the issue here. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners need to balance their personal needs with the family's. However, the wife is already shouldering most of the parenting and housework, so the husband's absence for four days could be seen as adding an unfair burden. The fact that the wife made it clear she didn't want him to go suggests that he didn't listen to her needs. \n\nSo, putting this together, the husband's decision to leave for four days without adequate support might be inconsiderate. The wife's input was disregarded when she expressed her concerns. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't take his wife's feelings and the practical challenges into account, leading to her being overwhelmed.\n"
