On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids, is in the wrong. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps with the kids and housework, but this time he left for four days to a music festival.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their partnership. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework alone during the week. The husband is working long hours and traveling, which probably adds to her workload. Weekends are her time to get support from him. If he usually helps on weekends, leaving her to do everything for four days might be overwhelming for her. \n\nThe user says the wife is exhausted from the week and then has no break. The husband is feeling guilty but thinks it's just one weekend. However, the wife's perspective is that four days is too much, so she clearly feels it's a significant burden. \n\nEven if the trip is once a year, the husband's decision to leave without considering how his wife would manage could be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is communication. Did the husband talk to his wife about the plans beforehand? If he didn't and assumed it was okay, that's a problem. The fact that she made it clear he made the wrong decision suggests that there was a lack of prior agreement or understanding. \n\nAlso, the husband's guilt indicates he recognizes the potential issue, but he still went ahead. Balancing work and personal time with the needs of the family is important. If the wife is the primary caregiver, it's crucial that the husband isn't adding to her stress by not supporting her during what's supposed to be a time for her to have help. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband probably is in the wrong because he didn't account for his wife's needs and the existing imbalance in their responsibilities. The answer should be A.\n"
