On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is at fault for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home mom, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. On weekends, he helps with the kids and housework. Now he's leaving for four days to a music festival, and his wife is upset because she's already exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband feels he deserves a break, maybe that it's important for his mental health or maintaining friendships. The wife is the primary caregiver, handling most of the parenting and housework, and now she's left alone during the weekend when the husband usually helps. This could lead to her feeling overwhelmed or unsupported.\n\nMarriage advice often emphasizes the importance of balancing personal needs with the needs of the partner and family. However, in this case, the husband's absence might be adding to the wife's stress. The duration of four days seems significant, especially with two young kids. The wife's reaction is valid because she's the one managing everything without help. The husband might not be considering how his absence affects her.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that he's entitled to some time off, especially if he's working long hours. But if he's usually present on weekends, suddenly being away for four days could be a big shift. The key point here is communication. Did he check in with her beforehand? Did she agree to this? If she felt it was too much, then he might have disregarded her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife made it clear she's against the four-day trip suggests that her needs were not adequately considered. Even if it's a once-a-year trip, the impact on her is immediate and significant. The husband might need to find a middle ground, like a shorter trip or arranging help.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's decision might be seen as not considering his wife's current stress levels and responsibilities. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
