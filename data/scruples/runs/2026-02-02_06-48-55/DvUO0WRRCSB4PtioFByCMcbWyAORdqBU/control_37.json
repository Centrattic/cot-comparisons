      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who went on a weekend trip with friends is in the wrong. The situation is that he left his wife with their two kids, who's a stay-at-home parent. He works long hours and sometimes travels, and on weekends he helps out. This time, he went from Thursday to Sunday, which is four days. The wife is exhausted and had hoped for a break, but he left her again.\n\nHmm. So, he does contribute on weekends usually. But this time he took a longer trip. The wife is upset because she's been doing most of the work. He feels bad but thinks it's once a year. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. He works long hours and travels, which is mentioned. But weekends are supposed to be a time to decompress and help out. Leaving for four days might be seen as adding to the wife's burden. Even if he helps on regular weekends, a four-day trip is longer than a usual weekend. The wife's perspective is important here\u2014she's already exhausted from the week and the kids, so having her partner leave for four days could be really tough.\n\nBut he argues it's just one weekend a year. However, the wife's clear reaction is that it's too much. So maybe the problem is not the frequency but the duration. If he's usually there on weekends, a four-day absence might disrupt the routine they've built. Also, he mentions that he sometimes travels for work, so maybe the wife is used to that, but this is a personal trip with friends. That might make her feel like he's prioritizing his own needs over the family's. \n\nAnother angle: the wife is a stay-at-home parent, which can be isolating and exhausting. Having the husband leave for four days could mean she has no support, leading to burnout. Even if he usually helps on weekends, a four-day trip might mean she's handling everything alone, which is a lot. \n\nBut then, the husband does feel bad and acknowledges the impact. He's trying to balance his own needs for downtime with the family's. Maybe the issue is communication. Did they discuss this before? If the wife had expressed her feelings about the timing, maybe he should have adjusted. But he says she made it clear it was too much, so maybe he didn't take her feelings into account enough when making the decision. \n\nOn the other hand, self-care is important. He works long hours and needs a break. But the problem is the timing and how it affects the wife. If he's gone for four days, it's a significant chunk of time. The key might be whether there was a mutual agreement or if he considered her needs before deciding. If they usually split responsibilities and this was an exception without prior discussion, it could be seen as him not being considerate enough. \n\nI think the answer leans towards AITA being the husband. Because even though he has a valid need for a break, the wife's current situation (exhausted, handling kids alone) is a valid concern. He should have communicated better or found a way to balance it without leaving her alone for four days. So the answer is A.\n"
