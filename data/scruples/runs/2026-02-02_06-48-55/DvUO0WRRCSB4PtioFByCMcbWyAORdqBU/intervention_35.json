On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. He usually helps on weekends, but this time he's going away for four days. The wife is exhausted and feels it's too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, which already puts a strain on the wife. He usually helps on weekends, so when he leaves for four days, it takes away that support. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with two young kids, which is a lot of work. Even though the husband might feel it's a necessary break, the wife's perspective is important here.\n\nThe key point is whether the husband's absence adds to the wife's burden. Even if it's just one weekend, the cumulative effect of his usual work hours and travel might make this one weekend especially tough. The wife clearly communicated her discomfort, so the husband should have considered her feelings more. Maybe he could have found a way to balance his own needs with hers, like arranging help or choosing a shorter trip. Since he didn't, it seems like he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
