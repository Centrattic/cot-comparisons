      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is married with two young kids, a 4-year-old and a 1.5-year-old. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, doing most of the parenting and housework. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, leaving her with everything. On weekends, he usually helps out with the kids and chores. This time, he decided to go on a long weekend (Thursday to Sunday) with a friend to a music festival. The wife is exhausted from the week and now has to handle everything over the weekend. She's upset, saying that four days away is too much and that he made the wrong decision. The husband feels bad but thinks it's just one weekend a year.\n\nFirst, let's consider the wife's perspective. She's a stay-at-home parent with two young children. Young kids require a lot of attention, especially the 1.5-year-old who is likely still needing naps, feeding, and constant care. The wife is already managing everything during the week when he's working, and on weekends he usually helps. By leaving for four days, she's left with all the responsibilities alone, which is a significant burden. The fact that he's gone Thursday to Sunday is actually more than a four-day weekend; it's three nights and four days, which is a long time for a single parent. The wife is exhausted and needs a break, but instead, she's stuck with everything. That must be really tough for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is working long hours and sometimes traveling for work. He's trying to maintain his own well-being by taking a break, which is understandable. He mentions that he usually helps on weekends, so this is an exception. He feels bad about leaving her but thinks it's a one-time thing. However, the issue is that the wife already feels overwhelmed, and his absence adds to her stress. Even if it's just one weekend a year, the impact on her might be significant. The key here is communication. Did he discuss this with her beforehand? If he didn't consider her feelings and the practical implications, that's a problem.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's needs and the children's needs are primary here. Even though he's trying to take a break, the fact that he's leaving for four days when she's already overwhelmed might make him at fault. He should have considered her capacity and maybe found a solution, like arranging for help or choosing a different time. The fact that she made it clear it's too much and he went anyway suggests that he didn't take her concerns seriously enough. So, maybe he is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
