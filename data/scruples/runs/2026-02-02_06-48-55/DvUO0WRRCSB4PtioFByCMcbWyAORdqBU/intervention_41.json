On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife to handle their kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and he works long hours. On weekends, he helps out, but this time he's away for four days. The wife is clearly upset because she's already exhausted and doesn't get a break.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The husband didn't consider his wife's feelings here. Even if he felt like he needed a break, his wife's needs might be more pressing given the circumstances. She's managing two young kids, housework, and he's already working long hours. Taking four days off might seem like a lot, but it's not about him needing a break; it's about considering her workload.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's traveled for work and left her before adds to the stress. Maybe he's used to it, but combining work travel with personal travel might be too much for her to handle. The wife's exhaustion is valid, and not getting a weekend break could lead to resentment. The husband might not realize the emotional and physical toll it takes on her when he's away. \n\nEven if the intention was to have a break, the impact of his decision is more significant. The four-day trip might not be just four days for her; it's four days of non-stop childcare and housework without support. The husband should have prioritized his wife's well-being here. Maybe he could have found a shorter trip or arranged for help. Communication about his plans and checking in with his wife's capacity would have been better. \n\nSo considering all that, the husband did make the wrong decision by not fully considering his wife's situation. The answer is A.\n"
