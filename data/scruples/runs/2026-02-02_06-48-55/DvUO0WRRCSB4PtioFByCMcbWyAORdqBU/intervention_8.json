On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps with the kids and housework. This time, he's going away for four days, and the wife feels it's too much. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the balance of responsibilities. The husband works long hours and travels, so he's not always there. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, he does help, but now he's taking a four-day trip. The wife is exhausted, and this trip means she doesn't get a break. \n\nI should consider if the husband's actions are fair. Even though it's a one-time event, the wife is already stressed. The husband might be trying to recharge, but the wife's needs are being overlooked. The key here is communication. Did the husband discuss this with his wife beforehand? The post says she made it clear that four days was too much, implying maybe he didn't check in. \n\nAlso, the wife being a stay-at-home parent, the responsibilities are on her. If the husband is working a lot, maybe he should delegate more weekend help or find a way to share the load. Taking a four-day trip might not be fair if the wife isn't getting support. The husband might not realize the impact of his absence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is entitled to some time off. But the issue is the wife's exhaustion. The answer depends on whether the husband considered his wife's feelings and the practical aspects. Since the wife is already overwhelmed and the trip takes away her weekend break, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective. So, answer A.\n"
