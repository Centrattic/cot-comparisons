      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who left his wife with the kids for a weekend is in the wrong. The scenario is that they've been married 6 years, together 10. He works long hours and sometimes travels, and on weekends he helps with the kids and housework. This time he went to a music festival Thursday to Sunday, leaving his wife alone with two young kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent and is exhausted. He feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year thing. The wife says four days is too much.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the balance of responsibilities. He's working long hours and traveling, which already puts a strain on their family dynamics. On weekends, he usually pitches in, but this time he's away for four days. The wife is the primary caregiver, and he's adding to her burden by leaving. Even though it's once a year, the fact that it's four days might be a lot for her. He mentions feeling bad, so he's aware of the impact.\n\nBut he also argues it's a rare break for himself. The question is whether his needs for personal time outweigh her need for support. Since the kids are 4 and 1.5, they require a lot of attention. If the wife is already exhausted from the week, adding four days without help could be really tough. Maybe he should have considered other options, like shorter trips or arranging for help. But he went for four days, which the wife found too much. She's clearly communicated her feelings, so ignoring that might be wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone needs some personal time. But given the circumstances, maybe four days is excessive. The fact that he's been leaving her during the week with work and now again on the weekend might be compounding the issue. The wife's exhaustion is a valid concern. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because he didn't adequately consider his wife's well-being and the practical challenges she faces alone with the kids. Even if it's a rare trip, the duration and the cumulative stress might make it his fault. So I think the answer is A.\n"
