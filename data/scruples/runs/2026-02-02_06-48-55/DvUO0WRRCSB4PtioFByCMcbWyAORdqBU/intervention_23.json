On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and they have two young children. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, but he does help on weekends. This time, he's going away for four days, which the wife finds too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles and responsibilities. The wife is the primary caregiver, handling most of the parenting and housework, especially with two young kids. The husband does contribute on weekends, but this trip takes that away. The key point here is the impact on the wife and the kids. \n\nThe wife feels exhausted and hasn't had a break, which is understandable. Young children are demanding, and a stay-at-home parent without support can easily feel overwhelmed. The husband is taking a four-day break, which is a significant chunk of time. While he mentions it's only once a year, the duration might still be too long for the wife to manage alone. \n\nCommunication is also a factor. The wife made it clear that four days was too much, indicating that she felt this decision was unfair. If the husband didn't consider her input, that could be a problem. Even if he intended to balance his own needs, he should have prioritized his wife's well-being and the children's stability. \n\nAnother angle is the frequency of such trips. If this is a one-time event, maybe it's less of an issue, but the duration still matters. The wife's exhaustion suggests that she might not have had a break before, so adding this trip could push her over the edge. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he's taking a break once a year, but the wife's argument is that the length is too much. There's a balance between personal needs and family responsibilities. In this case, the husband's decision to be away for four days might tip the balance toward neglecting his family obligations, especially since the wife is already handling the bulk of the work. \n\nPossible solutions could be arranging for help during the trip or choosing a shorter break. The fact that he didn't do that might make him at fault. Also, considering the emotional impact on the wife, the husband's decision could be seen as insensitive if he didn't fully take her perspective into account. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions, while perhaps understandable, might be seen as putting his own needs above his family's during a time when they need support. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
