On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids, is in the wrong. The wife is a stay-at-home parent with two young children, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he does help out, but this time he left for four days. The wife is clearly upset because she's exhausted and not getting a break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is working long hours and traveling, which already takes time away from the family. Even though he helps on weekends, leaving for four days might add to the wife's burden. The key point is whether the husband considered his wife's feelings before making the trip. He mentions feeling bad about it, which shows he's aware of the impact, but he still chose to go. \n\nThe wife has made it clear that four days is too much, indicating that she feels overwhelmed. The husband's justification is that it's a once-a-year event, but if his wife is struggling regularly, perhaps he should prioritize her well-being. The fact that he's working a lot might mean that he's not fully sharing the parenting responsibilities, leading to an imbalance. \n\nOn the other hand, it's important to note that the husband does pitch in on weekends, so he's contributing. The question is whether a four-day absence is reasonable. Maybe if they had discussed it beforehand and the wife had agreed, but since she's upset, it suggests that the communication was lacking or her needs weren't considered. \n\nIn relationships, mutual understanding and communication are key. If the wife's needs aren't being met, and the husband is choosing a personal trip over her well-being, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if it's a rare event, if it's causing significant stress for his wife, the husband might need to reconsider future plans. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband might be in the wrong because he left his wife in a difficult situation without adequately considering her needs. Even though he has his reasons, prioritizing a personal trip over the wife's emotional and physical well-being when she's already stressed could be seen as a mistake.\n"
