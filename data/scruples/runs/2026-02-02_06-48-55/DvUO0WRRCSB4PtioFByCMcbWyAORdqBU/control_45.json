On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps with the kids and housework. This time, he left for a 4-day trip, causing his wife to feel overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework, especially since she's a stay-at-home mom. The husband's work schedule is already demanding, but he does help on weekends. The trip is once a year, but his absence adds to her stress. The wife clearly communicated her feelings about it being too much.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to take this trip? Well, everyone needs personal time, but the key points are the frequency and the communication. The husband says it's once a year, but the wife feels it's too much. Even if it's not frequent, if the wife is already overwhelmed, this could be adding to her burden. The fact that he's working long hours and sometimes traveling might mean he's not fully aware of the extent of her responsibilities. The wife's exhaustion is a valid concern here. \n\nThe husband feeling bad suggests he recognizes the impact, but the wife's explicit objection matters. The question is whether his need for a break justifies leaving her in a tough spot. Since the wife is the primary caregiver and the husband isn't there to share the load, this might be an unfair expectation. Even if he helps on weekends, taking four days off could be more than she can handle alone. The answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) because the husband's action might be seen as prioritizing his own needs over his wife's well-being and the children's. However, it's also about balance. But given the wife's clear distress, it's possible the author is in the wrong. So maybe answer A.\n"
