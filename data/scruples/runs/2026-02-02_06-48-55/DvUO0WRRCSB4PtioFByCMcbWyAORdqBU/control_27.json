      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who went on a weekend trip with friends is in the wrong for leaving his wife with the kids.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been married 6 years, together 10. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with two kids, ages 4 and 1.5. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so the wife does most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, he helps out. This time, he went on a 4-day trip to a music festival, leaving the wife with the kids. The wife is exhausted and feels she didn't get a break. The husband feels bad but thinks it's once a year. The wife says it's too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the division of responsibilities and communication. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, which already puts a lot on the wife. Weekends are when he usually helps, but this time he left. The wife is already stretched thin. Even if it's a once-a-year trip, the decision to leave during a time when she's already under stress might not consider her situation enough. \n\nBut maybe he's justified because he's taking a break once a year. However, considering the wife's perspective, she's handling everything else. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, maybe there's a communication issue. The wife made it clear it's too much, so maybe he should have considered her feelings more. The fact that he felt bad shows he cares, but the action still affected her. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require balance. Both partners need personal time. But when one is already overwhelmed, taking a break without considering the partner's needs can be seen as selfish. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't account for her exhaustion and existing workload. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
