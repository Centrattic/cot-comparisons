      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle their two kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps with the kids and housework. This time, he went away from Thursday to Sunday for a music festival, and his wife is upset because she's exhausted and not getting a break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is working a lot, which already puts a strain on the wife, who's managing the household and children alone during his work hours. On weekends, he does help out, but this time he's leaving for four days. The key points are the balance of responsibilities and the communication between the couple.\n\nThe user argues that the husband is in the wrong. Let me see why. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, which is a full-time job plus managing the house. If the husband is leaving her alone for four days, even though he usually helps on weekends, that might add to her already heavy workload. The fact that he went for a music festival, which is a social event, might be seen as selfish if it wasn't communicated or discussed with the wife beforehand. The wife made it clear that four days is too much, so maybe the husband didn't listen to her concerns, which could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband mentions that he feels bad and that it's only one weekend a year. He's trying to have a break, which is understandable. People need personal time. However, the issue is whether his actions are considerate of his wife's situation. If the wife is already overwhelmed, taking away her weekend break could be really stressful for her. The husband might be neglecting his responsibilities by not sharing the load adequately, especially since he's already working long hours.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the husband check with his wife before making the plans? If they discussed it and she agreed, then it's a different scenario. But according to the post, the wife made it clear she thought it was too much, implying that maybe they didn't talk about it or didn't reach an agreement. If he went ahead without considering her feelings, that's inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's going for a music festival suggests it's a leisure activity. While it's important for him to have personal time, the wife's well-being and the children's needs should be a priority. If the husband is already not around much during the week, using the weekend as his only time to relax might not be fair to his wife who's managing everything else.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps they could have arranged for help or support over the weekend, like a babysitter, or adjusted the trip to be shorter. The husband's intention to take a break is valid, but the execution might have been flawed by not considering his wife's capacity and agreeing on a plan.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, in many cultures, both partners are expected to share responsibilities. If the husband is not sharing the burden adequately, then his actions might be seen as unfair. The wife might feel unsupported, especially if she's handling everything else without help. The husband's absence for four days could exacerbate her stress, leading to resentment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's decision to leave for four days without ensuring his wife's well-being or without proper support might be inconsiderate. The key factors are communication, balance of responsibilities, and consideration for the wife's situation. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
