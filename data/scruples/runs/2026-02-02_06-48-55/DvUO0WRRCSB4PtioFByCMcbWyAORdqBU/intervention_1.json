      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for going on a weekend trip with friends and leaving their wife to handle the kids and housework. The wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young kids, and the husband works long hours. He helps on weekends, but this time he's leaving for four days. The wife is upset, saying it's too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nFirst, the husband works long hours and already travels for work sometimes, so he's not always present. On his regular weekends, he helps with parenting and housework. So maybe he's trying to balance work and family. But this trip is four days, which is a full workweek. The wife is the sole parent during that time, which could be overwhelming, especially with two young kids. The children are 4 and 1.5, so the younger one is a toddler, which requires more attention. \n\nThe husband feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year thing. The wife, however, clearly says it's too much. So the key here is communication and mutual understanding. Even if the husband is trying to take a break, if the wife isn't comfortable with the arrangement, it's a problem. They should have discussed this before he made the decision. \n\nMaybe the husband didn't consider how his absence would affect his wife. Even though he helps on regular weekends, this is an extended absence. The wife is already exhausted, and this adds to her stress. The fact that she made it clear he made the wrong decision shows that they have different perspectives here. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs are important. The husband might need some time to himself, but the wife's needs as a parent are also crucial. If he went without considering her input, that could be the issue. But if they had talked it out and she still objected, maybe he should have respected that. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether they had a prior agreement or discussion. If he decided unilaterally without considering her feelings, then he is in the wrong. But if they had discussed it and he still went against her wishes, that's also a problem. Since the wife is already stressed and the kids need both parents, his absence might not be the best choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize his wife's well-being and the children's needs in this situation, even if it's a rare trip. The wife's clear objection indicates that he overstepped.\n"
