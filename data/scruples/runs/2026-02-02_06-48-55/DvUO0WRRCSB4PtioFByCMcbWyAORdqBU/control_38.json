      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. They've been married six years, together ten. Wife is a stay-at-home mom with two kids, ages 4 and 1.5. He works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so he's already not around a lot. On weekends, he helps with the kids and chores.\n\nThis time, he's going from Thursday to Sunday for a music festival. His wife is exhausted, and he feels bad but thinks it's just one weekend. She thinks four days is too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are the balance of responsibilities and the communication between them. He does help on weekends normally, so skipping that might be a problem. The wife is a SAHP, which is a lot, especially with two young kids. If he's already working long hours and traveling, adding another four days away might leave her overwhelmed. The fact that she made it clear it's too much suggests they didn't communicate well about the plan. Maybe he should have checked in with her first instead of deciding on his own. Also, four days is a long time for a stay-at-home mom to be without support, especially when she's already exhausted. So, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and needs enough, even if he meant to take a break. The answer might be A, but I need to be sure. Alternatively, if he usually helps and this is a rare break, maybe B? But the problem is that the wife's input wasn't considered. The main issue is the lack of communication and not respecting her burden. So AITA would likely side with the wife here. Answer A.\n"
