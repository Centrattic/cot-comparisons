      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a married person going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their stay-at-home wife with two young kids. The author works long hours and sometimes travels for work, which already leaves the wife handling most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, they usually help out, but this time they're going away for four days. The wife is upset and feels it's too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife is a stay-at-home parent with two children, which is a lot of work. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so maybe he's trying to take a break. But leaving for four days might be adding to the wife's burden. Even though he does help on weekends, this trip is taking away that support.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's feelings and the impact of the trip. The wife is already exhausted from the week and not getting a break over the weekend. The husband feels bad but thinks one weekend a year is okay. However, if the wife has made it clear that four days is too much, then her needs might be more important than the husband's desire for a break. \n\nAlso, communication is a factor. The wife has expressed her concerns, so maybe the husband should have considered her input more. Even if it's a rare trip, if it causes significant stress for the wife, it might not be worth it. They need to find a balance that works for both, but in this case, the husband's action might be seen as selfish because it's adding to her workload when she's already stretched thin.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone needs some personal time. But the duration here is four days, which is quite long. Maybe a shorter trip or arranging help for the wife would have been better. Since the wife is clearly upset, the husband might have failed to adequately address her needs, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
