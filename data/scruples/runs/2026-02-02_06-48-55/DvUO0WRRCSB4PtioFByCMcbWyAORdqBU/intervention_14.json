On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who went on a four-day trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids and household alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young children, which is a lot of work. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so on weekends he usually helps out.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is at fault here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics. The wife is already handling most of the parenting and housework. The husband does help on weekends, but in this case, he's taking a four-day weekend away. The wife is exhausted from the week and now has no support over the weekend. The husband feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year break. However, the wife clearly communicated that four days is too much and that the decision was wrong.\n\nKey points: The wife is a stay-at-home parent, which is a demanding role. The husband's absence adds to her workload. Even if it's a rare break for him, the wife's well-being and needs are important. The husband should consider her perspective more. Relationships require mutual support and communication. If the wife has already expressed her exhaustion and dissatisfaction, then the husband's decision to go might be neglecting her needs. There's a lack of compromise or discussion here. Maybe the husband didn't consider the impact enough. So, the husband might be in the wrong because he prioritized his own needs without adequately addressing his wife's. So, answer A.\n"
