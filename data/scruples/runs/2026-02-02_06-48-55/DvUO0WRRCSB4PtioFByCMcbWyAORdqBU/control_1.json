      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle their two kids. The wife is a stay-at-home mom, and he works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps with the kids and housework.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the wife is already doing most of the parenting and housework during the week. The husband's absence over the weekend means she not only doesn't get a break but also has to manage alone. The husband feels bad but thinks it's a rare weekend away. The wife disagrees, saying four days is too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The husband's usual weekend help is important. If he's absent, the wife has no respite. Even if it's once a year, the impact on the wife's well-being is significant. The wife's exhaustion is a valid point. The husband might feel he needs personal time, but the wife's needs as a caregiver might be more pressing. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. Both partners need time for themselves, but when one partner is shouldering most responsibilities, the other's absence can add stress. The husband might not be in the wrong entirely, but maybe he didn't consider the wife's perspective enough. The fact that the wife made it clear it's too much suggests communication was there, but he went ahead anyway. \n\nSo, the answer depends on prioritizing the partner's well-being. If the husband's absence is causing her more stress, even if it's a rare event, it's a problem. The author might be in the wrong because he chose his needs over hers, despite her protest. However, if he had arranged for help, maybe it's different. But since he didn't, and the wife is already overwhelmed, it's probably AITA. So the answer is A.\n"
