      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's going on a four-day trip with friends to a music festival, leaving his wife to handle the kids and everything else. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with two small children, which is a lot of work. He works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so he's already not there a lot. On weekends, he does help out with the kids and chores.\n\nHe feels bad about leaving her this weekend, but he thinks it's just one weekend a year. His wife disagrees and says four days is too much. The question is whether he's at fault here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. From his side, he's trying to have a break and maybe recharge, which is understandable. It's a long weekend, and he's not doing it often. He does contribute on weekends when he's there. But from the wife's perspective, she's already overwhelmed with managing two young kids, housework, and now having to do it all without her partner for four days. That's a lot of stress and responsibility. \n\nThe key points here are the frequency of his absence and the wife's current capacity. If he's already working long hours and traveling for work, adding a four-day trip might be compounding the stress on her. Even if he helps on weekends, a four-day absence is significant, especially when the kids are young and require constant attention. The wife's exhaustion is a big factor here. She's been made to feel like she's the primary caregiver all the time, and this might be the last straw for her. \n\nAlso, communication is important. If he had planned this trip without discussing it with her or not considering her current state, that could be a problem. But the post mentions that he feels bad about it, indicating he's aware of the impact. However, the fact that she made it clear it's too much suggests that he might not have considered her opinion enough in the decision-making process. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. Both partners should feel supported and not overburdened. If he's already working a lot, maybe he needs to find ways to support his wife more at home to reduce her load, rather than taking a break that adds to her stress. But if this is a rare occurrence and they've discussed it before, maybe it's okay. However, the wife's reaction indicates it's not okay this time. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because he's adding to his wife's already heavy workload without adequately considering her perspective and current capacity. Even though he's trying to take a break, the timing and duration might be too much for her to handle alone. The wife's well-being and ability to manage are crucial here, and he might have overlooked that.\n"
