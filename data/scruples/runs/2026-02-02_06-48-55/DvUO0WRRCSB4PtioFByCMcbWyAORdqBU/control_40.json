      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, a husband, is asking if he's at fault for going on a long weekend trip with friends while his wife, a stay-at-home parent, is left with their two kids. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework because the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. On weekends, he usually helps out with the kids and chores. This time, he decided to go to a music festival from Thursday to Sunday, which means he's away for four days. His wife is exhausted and feels she's not getting a break, and she's told him he made the wrong decision.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The husband works a lot and travels, so maybe he's trying to have some personal time. But his wife is a stay-at-home parent, which is a big responsibility. The kids are 4 and 1.5 years old, so they require a lot of attention. If he usually helps on weekends, but this time he's gone, that adds to the wife's workload. The wife is clearly upset because she's already exhausted from the week and now has to manage without him over the weekend.\n\nI should think about balance. The husband might feel he needs a break, but is four days too long? It's only once a year, he says. But the wife is a stay-at-home parent, which is a full-time job. If he's away for four days, that's a significant chunk of time where she has no support. Even if he's working long hours, maybe he should consider the impact on his wife. Communication is key here. If the wife expressed her concerns before the trip, did he take them into account? He mentioned he feels bad but still went. Maybe he should have found a compromise, like a shorter trip or arranging help.\n\nAnother angle: he sometimes travels for work, which is different from personal trips. Maybe the wife is used to him being away for work, but a personal trip feels more selfish. The fact that he's going to a music festival, which is a leisure activity, might make the wife feel neglected compared to work-related travel. Also, the wife's perspective is important. She's the one handling everything, and even though he helps on weekends, being away for four days might leave her without any support. \n\nIs it fair to expect the wife to handle everything? In a marriage, both partners should share responsibilities. If the husband is working a lot, maybe they need to discuss how to split the load better. But in this case, he's taking a personal break, which might not be unreasonable, but the timing and the duration might be the issue. The wife's exhaustion is a key point. If she's already overwhelmed, adding four days without help could be too much. The husband might need to recognize that his personal time shouldn't come at the cost of her well-being if she's already stretched thin.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a judgment call. He might not be entirely at fault if he's trying to balance work and personal life, but he should have considered his wife's feelings and workload more carefully. Since the wife clearly expressed her discomfort and he went anyway, maybe he is in the wrong because he prioritized his trip over her needs. Alternatively, if they've discussed and agreed on this, it's different, but from the post, it sounds like she was against it. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't adequately consider her situation despite knowing she was exhausted and it's a significant time away.\n"
