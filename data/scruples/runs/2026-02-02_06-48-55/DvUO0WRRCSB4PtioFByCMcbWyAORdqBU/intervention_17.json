On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, handling most of the parenting and housework. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, but on weekends he helps out. This time, he's leaving for four days to a music festival. The wife is clearly upset and feels overwhelmed.\n\nSo, the main points here are the balance of responsibilities. The husband is taking time for himself, which is understandable, but the wife is already managing a lot. Even though he pitches in on weekends, this trip means she's alone for four days. The wife's exhaustion is a key factor. She's been stressed and needs a break too. The husband might feel it's a rare treat for himself, but it's important to consider her perspective.\n\nCommunication is also an issue here. Did they discuss this beforehand? If the wife made it clear that four days is too much, the husband should have considered that. Maybe the trip is a way to recharge for him, but if it's causing significant stress for his wife, it's a problem. The fact that she's been exhausted from the week and then the weekend is taken by his trip adds up. \n\nI think the husband is in the wrong here. While self-care is important, the wife's needs in this situation seem to be more critical. He could have found a shorter trip or adjusted plans to avoid leaving her for four days. The key is mutual consideration and communication. If they didn't address her concerns, then he's not fully supporting her, which is part of a partnership. So, answer A.\n"
