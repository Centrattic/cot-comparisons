On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did the wrong thing by going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours, sometimes traveling for work. He mentions he helps on weekends, but this time he's away for four days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is already juggling two young children, which is a lot of work. The husband works long hours, which suggests he's busy but does contribute on weekends. However, this weekend he's completely absent, leaving her without support. The key point is that the wife expressed it's too much and that the decision was wrong. The husband feels bad but thinks it's a necessary break for him.\n\nNow, from a fairness perspective, both partners have needs. The husband might need personal time for mental health, but the wife's needs are immediate and ongoing, especially with young kids. The fact that the trip is four days is significant because it's an extended period without support. Even though he helps on weekends normally, this absence removes his usual assistance, leading to her exhaustion.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important. She's made it clear it's too much, which indicates that their communication is ongoing about their responsibilities. If she's already stressed, adding this trip might tip the balance. The husband might not realize the impact of his absence, but since she's communicated her feelings, his decision could be seen as selfish if he proceeds despite her objections.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The husband is taking a break to recharge, which is important for a healthy relationship. The question is whether the timing and duration are reasonable. One weekend a year might seem like a small sacrifice, but in a situation with two young children, even a single weekend without help can be overwhelming. The wife's exhaustion is a valid concern.\n\nConsidering the balance of responsibilities, the husband's long hours and travel mean he's already contributing in other ways. But the weekend is a critical time for her to have support. His decision to leave for four days might not consider her current stress levels. The fact that she's the sole parent and housekeeper makes her reliance on his weekend help crucial. \n\nSo, while the husband has a right to personal time, the immediate impact on his wife's well-being might make him in the wrong. The key is that he didn't plan this trip in a way that accounts for her needs, even after she expressed her concerns. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
