      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person (AITA) is going on a long weekend trip with friends to a music festival, leaving their wife at home with two young kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps with kids and housework.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's current state and the balance of responsibilities. The wife is described as exhausted, which the AITA acknowledges. The trip is from Thursday to Sunday, which is four days. The wife has already expressed that four days is too much and that the decision was wrong.\n\nNow, considering the time frame. The husband is taking four days off, which is significant. Even though he mentions that it's only once a year, the impact on his wife is immediate and substantial. She's already handling most of the parenting and housework, especially with two young children. The fact that he usually helps on weekends but is absent for four days now adds to the strain.\n\nThe question is whether the husband's decision is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to assess if that's the case. Factors to consider include communication, the necessity of the trip, and the wife's feelings. The wife made it clear that she felt overwhelmed, so the husband might have gone against her wishes. Even if it's a rare event, respecting her feelings and the current stress she's under is crucial. The alternative might be to have communicated better, maybe adjusted the trip duration or made other arrangements to support his wife. Since he went ahead despite her objections, it could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer would lean towards AITA being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
