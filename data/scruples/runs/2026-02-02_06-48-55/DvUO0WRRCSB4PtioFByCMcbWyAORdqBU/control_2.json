      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps with the kids and housework. This time, he left for four days to a music festival, and his wife is upset because she's already exhausted from the week and now has no help over the weekend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband does work long hours and sometimes travels, so maybe he's trying to take some personal time. But the key point here is that the wife is a stay-at-home mom with two young kids, which is a lot of work. Even if he helps on weekends, leaving her alone for four days might be a big burden. The wife expressed that it's too much and that he made the wrong decision. That's a red flag because she's clearly not okay with it. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year thing. However, the wife's feelings matter here. If they hadn't discussed this before, maybe there was a lack of communication. The husband might have thought he's getting a break, but he didn't consider her perspective enough. \n\nAlso, the fact that the wife is the primary caregiver means that her workload is significant. Even if he helps on weekends, taking away that support for four days could be overwhelming. The husband's absence might lead to her having to do everything, which could cause stress and resentment. \n\nBut wait, if this is a once-in-a-year trip, maybe it's not as bad? But the problem is that the wife is already exhausted, and this adds to her stress. The husband should have checked in with her more, maybe discussed the plans earlier to see if they could find a solution, like getting help or adjusting the trip. \n\nSo, the husband might not be entirely in the wrong, but he didn't consider his wife's feelings and workload adequately. The fact that she made it clear she didn't agree with his decision suggests that he should have respected her wishes more. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. While self-care is important for the husband, it shouldn't come at the expense of the wife's well-being. There might be a balance to find, but in this case, the husband might have overstepped by not listening to her concerns. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards AITA being on the husband's side because he didn't prioritize his wife's input and the situation might have been avoidable with better communication.\n"
