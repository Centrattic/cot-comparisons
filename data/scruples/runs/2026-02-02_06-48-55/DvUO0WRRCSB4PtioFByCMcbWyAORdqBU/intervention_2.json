On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, so she's handling most of the childcare and housework. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps out, but this time he left for four days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband feels bad about leaving, but he thinks it's just one weekend a year. The wife is clearly upset because she's already exhausted and now has to manage everything alone. \n\nThe key points here are the balance of responsibilities. The husband works long hours and is away for work, which already puts a strain on the wife. Then, adding a four-day trip on top of that might be too much. Even if he helps on weekends, a four-day absence could mean she's handling everything for an extended period. \n\nI should think about communication. The wife made it clear that four days was too much, so the husband didn't respect her feelings here. Even if he felt it was necessary for his own break, he should have considered her input. Relationships require compromise, and if the wife expressed her concerns, not heeding them might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's once a year might not make up for the stress and workload she has to take on. The wife's exhaustion is a valid point. Parenting two young kids is demanding, and without support, it's a lot. The husband's need for a break isn't wrong, but maybe the duration and timing weren't considered properly. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't take his wife's feelings into account and left her with an overwhelming situation. Even if he had intentions to take a break, the impact on his wife was significant. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's any mitigating factors. The user says the husband helps on weekends, but a four-day trip would mean three days of the weekend and part of the week. Maybe the wife isn't used to being alone for that long. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's needs is crucial. If the wife communicated her discomfort and the husband proceeded anyway, that's a breach of trust or consideration. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
