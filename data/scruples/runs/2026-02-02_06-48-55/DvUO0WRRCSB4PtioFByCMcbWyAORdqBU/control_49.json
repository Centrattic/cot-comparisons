      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about whether it's okay for the husband to take a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle everything with the kids.\n\nFirst, the setup: They've been married 6 years, together 10, wife is a stay-at-home parent for two kids, ages 4 and 1.5. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so the wife does most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, he usually helps out. But this time, he's going away from Thursday to Sunday for a music festival with a friend. The wife is exhausted, not getting a break, and he's leaving her to manage everything. He feels bad but thinks it's just one weekend. She says it's too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are the balance between the husband's need for a break and the wife's already heavy load. The wife is a SAHP for two young kids, which is a lot. If the husband is already working long hours and sometimes traveling, maybe the wife is used to handling things when he's away for work. But this time is a personal trip, not work-related. The wife's perspective is that she's already exhausted and not getting a break. The husband is trying to justify it as a one-time thing, but the wife disagrees.\n\nI need to consider if the husband is overstepping by taking personal time when the wife is already stretched thin. Even if he usually helps on weekends, taking four days off might leave the wife without any support, especially with a 1.5-year-old, which is a very young child. The wife might be dealing with sleepless nights, feeding, etc., which can be exhausting. The husband's absence could add to her stress. Also, the fact that she's made it clear it's too much suggests that her needs are important here. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might need personal time for his well-being. But the question is whether his need to take this trip overrides the wife's current situation. The wife's role as a SAHP is demanding, and if the husband is already working long hours, maybe there's an imbalance in household responsibilities. However, this specific instance is a personal choice to be away, not something work-related. So, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to have a break, but he might not have considered the wife's current state. But since the wife explicitly said it's too much, and he went ahead anyway, that could mean he's prioritizing his own time over her needs, which is a problem.\n\nAnother angle: Communication. Did they discuss this beforehand? The post says the wife made it clear she didn't want him to go, so he went anyway. That's a red flag. If the wife expressed her concerns and he ignored them, that's a problem. Even if he felt bad, acting on his own decision without considering her clear objections makes him at least partially at fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's going for a music festival with a friend might be seen as less essential compared to work travel. Work is necessary, but a personal trip might be seen as a luxury when the wife is already struggling. So, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect his wife's feelings and the current situation she's in. Even if he's trying to have a break, he should have prioritized her needs here.\n"
