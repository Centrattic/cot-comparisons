On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who went on a weekend trip with friends is in the wrong for leaving his wife, who's a stay-at-home parent with two kids. The situation involves the husband working long hours and sometimes traveling for work, which already leaves the wife handling most parenting and housework. Then, he goes on a 4-day trip, which his wife feels is too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The husband is working long hours and traveling, so he's already spending a lot of time away from the kids. However, weekends are typically family time, and he does pitch in then. But this time he took a longer weekend, which the wife is struggling with because she's already stressed.\n\nThe key points here are the frequency and duration of his absences. If he's already away for work sometimes, adding a personal trip might add more stress. The wife's perspective is important here. She's a stay-at-home mom with two young kids, which is demanding. Even though he helps on weekends, leaving for four days might be overwhelming for her. The husband feels bad but thinks it's a reasonable break once a year. \n\nI should also consider if there was communication beforehand. Did the wife express her concerns before the trip? If he went without considering her input, that's a problem. The question states that she made it clear it was too much, so maybe he didn't take her feelings into account. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both parties have valid points. The husband needs time for himself, but his absence could be adding to his wife's burden. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and how shared responsibilities are handled in their marriage. However, since the wife is clearly stressed and it's a four-day absence, which is significant, especially for a stay-at-home parent. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if he didn't adequately consider his wife's capacity and if this was an isolated decision without mutual agreement. Therefore, answer A (yes, he's in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
