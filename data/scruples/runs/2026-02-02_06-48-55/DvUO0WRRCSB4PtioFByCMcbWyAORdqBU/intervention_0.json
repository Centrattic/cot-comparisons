      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps with the kids and housework. This time, he went away from Thursday to Sunday, leaving his wife with the two young children.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key factors here are the wife's current situation and the husband's actions. The wife is already handling most of the parenting and housework, especially since the children are 4 and 1.5 years old, which requires a lot of attention. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so he's already away from home part of the time. On weekends, he usually pitches in, but this time he's gone for four days. The wife is clearly upset, feeling like she's not getting a break and that the husband's absence is too much.\n\nNow, considering the husband's justification: he mentions it's only once a year and he feels bad. But the wife has made it clear that four days is too much. The main point here is about balance and mutual support in a relationship. Even if the trip is a rare break for the husband, the wife's needs as a primary caregiver might take precedence. The fact that the wife is exhausted and the kids are young suggests that her role is demanding. The husband's action might be seen as not considering her well-being and adding to her stress.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband might not have checked in with his wife about her feelings before making the trip. Even if he intended to take a break, respecting his wife's input is crucial. Since the wife expressed her distress, the husband's decision, while perhaps understandable, could be seen as selfish because it disregards her current situation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that everyone needs personal time, and it's not entirely unreasonable for the husband to take a break once a year. But given the context of his wife being a stay-at-home parent with two young kids and him working long hours, the balance might be tipped in favor of the wife's needs. The wife's exhaustion is a significant factor here. If the husband is already working a lot, maybe he should consider other ways to relax without leaving his wife in such a challenging situation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband might be in the wrong because he didn't take into account his wife's current stress and responsibilities, leading to her being overwhelmed. The answer would likely be A, yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
