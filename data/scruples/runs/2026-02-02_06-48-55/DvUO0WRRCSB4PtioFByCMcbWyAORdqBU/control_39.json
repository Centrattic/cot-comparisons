      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong (ITA) for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids.\n\nThe context is that the wife is a stay-at-home parent with two young children, ages 4 and 1.5. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, but on weekends, he usually helps with the kids and housework. This time, he's going from Thursday to Sunday for a music festival. The wife is exhausted and feels that she didn't get a break, and she's made it clear that four days is too much. The husband feels bad but thinks it's just one weekend away a year.\n\nHmm, so to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider several factors. First, the balance of responsibilities. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework, which is a lot, especially with two young kids. The husband is already working long hours and traveling, which might add to her burden. Then, on the weekends, he usually helps, but this time he's leaving for four days. So the wife is left with all the responsibility, which is tough.\n\nBut the husband argues it's only once a year. However, even once a year could be significant if it's a major strain. The key here is communication and the couple's agreement. Did they discuss this beforehand? If the wife made it clear that four days is too much, then the husband might have ignored her concerns. That could be a problem. Even if the husband felt it was necessary for his own well-being, he didn't consider his wife's feelings or the practical impact on her.\n\nAlso, considering the children's ages, a 1.5-year-old is very young and requires constant attention. A four-day break for the parent could be overwhelming. The husband leaving without help might exacerbate her exhaustion. Even if he usually helps on weekends, this absence removes that support entirely.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's work schedule is already demanding, and he's taking some time off for a festival. It's not entirely unreasonable to take a break, but it's the impact on his wife. If the wife is already overwhelmed, then maybe the husband should have arranged for additional help or rescheduled the trip. The fact that she's made it clear it's too much suggests that he didn't listen to her needs.\n\nSo, in terms of right vs. wrong, the husband's actions might be seen as selfish if he prioritized his own needs without considering the wife's already heavy load. Even with good intentions, if his decision causes significant stress to his partner, especially when she's already overburdened, he's in the wrong. It's about shared responsibility in parenting and respecting each other's capacities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
