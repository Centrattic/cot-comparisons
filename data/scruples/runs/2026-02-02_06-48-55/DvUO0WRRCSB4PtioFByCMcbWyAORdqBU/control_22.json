On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife, who is a stay-at-home mom with two young kids. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, and while he helps on weekends, this time he's leaving for four days. The wife is clearly upset because she's exhausted and doesn't get a break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is taking a break, which might be important for his mental health and relationships with friends. But the wife is already overwhelmed with childcare and housework, especially since he's working a lot and she's handling most of the parenting. Leaving her alone for four days could add to her stress and workload. \n\nThe key points here are the balance of responsibilities and communication. The husband mentions he pitches in on weekends, but this time he's not there. The wife feels it's too much. Even though he feels bad, he went ahead with the trip. The question is whether his actions are reasonable or if he should have prioritized his wife's needs.\n\nI should think about whether four days is an unreasonable amount of time. Since he's already working long hours and sometimes traveling, maybe this trip is a way to recharge, but maybe the wife's current situation is more critical. The fact that she's a stay-at-home parent with two young kids means she's dealing with constant demands. If the husband is not there to help, even for a few days, it might be too much. \n\nAlso, the wife made it clear she was against the trip. If he went anyway despite her objections, that could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Communication is key in relationships, and if he didn't adequately address her concerns or find a compromise, that's a problem. \n\nBut on the other hand, everyone needs personal time. If the husband isn't getting breaks, that could also affect the relationship negatively. The issue is whether four days is a fair trade-off. Maybe the answer depends on how often such trips happen and if there's a pattern. Since it's once a year, maybe it's understandable, but if the wife is already struggling, even one time could be too much.\n\nSo, weighing the needs of both, the husband might be in the wrong if he didn't consider his wife's perspective and the impact on her. The answer might be A, but I need to be careful. The user might be looking for a balanced view, but the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the wife is clearly upset and the husband left despite knowing the stress, it's possible he is in the wrong.\n"
