On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband going on a long weekend trip with friends to a music festival, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent with two young children, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps out, but this time he's away for four days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband argues that it's a once-a-year opportunity and that he's already working long hours. The wife is clearly exhausted and feels it's too much to handle everything alone for four days. The key points here are the balance of responsibilities, communication, and the frequency of such trips.\n\nThe wife is the primary caregiver, and the husband's absence might be compounding her stress. Even though he helps on weekends, a four-day absence during the weekend is significant. He mentions it's been hard on her, but he still went. The question is whether taking this trip is justifiable given the impact on his wife.\n\nCommunication seems important here. If the wife had made her feelings clear beforehand, the author might not have gone. But since he went anyway, it shows he didn't prioritize her needs in this case. The fact that it's only one weekend a year might be a mitigating factor, but the wife's exhaustion and the specific need for help are stronger points. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but he did make a decision that affected his wife negatively, despite knowing her feelings. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the wife is the one handling all the responsibilities, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her situation enough before going. I think the answer is A.\n"
