      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle two kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and he works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps with the kids and housework.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is the primary caregiver, which is a lot of responsibility. The husband is working long hours and sometimes traveling, so when he's home, he does contribute on weekends. Now, he's taking a 4-day trip, leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is clearly upset, saying it's too much and that he made the wrong decision. He feels bad but thinks it's once a year.\n\nThe key points to evaluate are: shared responsibilities, communication, and the impact of his absence. The husband has a valid point that he's taking a break once a year, but the wife is already stressed and overburdened. If he's not contributing as much during the trip, the imbalance could be significant. Also, how often does this happen? If it's a one-time thing and they usually have a good balance, maybe it's understandable. But if this adds to a pattern where the wife feels neglected, then maybe the husband is in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did they discuss this beforehand? The wife made it clear it's too much, so if he went anyway despite her objections, that's a problem. It's important to respect her feelings and consider her input. Even if he wanted a break, the wife's well-being and the children's needs should be a priority. The fact that she's exhausted and then has no break over the weekend could mean that his decision isn't considerate of her situation.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone needs some personal time. The husband isn't doing it frequently, and he does help during the week. But the timing and duration might be an issue. Four days is a long time for someone already stressed. Maybe the husband should have found a compromise, like a shorter trip or arranging for help during the weekend.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's desire for a break is understandable, the decision to leave without considering the wife's expressed needs and the added stress on her might make him at fault. The key is whether he respected her feelings and the impact on their family dynamic.\n"
