      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who went on a weekend trip with friends is in the wrong. The wife is a stay-at-home parent with two young kids, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. The husband usually helps on weekends, but this time he went to a festival for four days, and the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework, which can be really draining, especially with two young children. The husband does help on weekends, but this time he's away for four days. The wife feels exhausted and not getting a break, which is valid. Young kids require a lot of attention, and without a break, it can lead to burnout.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that it's a rare weekend away and he feels bad for leaving. But the key point here is that the wife clearly communicated that four days is too much. If he knew she was struggling and still went, that might be the issue. Even if he wanted a break, he should have considered her needs. They have a young child (1.5 years old), which makes the situation more demanding. The wife probably can't handle four days alone without help.\n\nAlso, the husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so maybe he's used to being away, but the weekend is typically when parents can rely on each other. If he's not there, the burden falls entirely on her. The fact that she made it clear she didn't want him to go suggests that he didn't prioritize her needs in this case. Even if it's one time, if it's causing significant stress, it's not a minor issue. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not listening to her concerns and not finding an alternative solution, like having someone help or rescheduling the trip.\n"
