On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids.\n\nThe situation is that the wife is a stay-at-home parent, taking care of two children under five. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, and on weekends he usually helps with parenting and housework. This time, he decided to go on a 4-day trip, leaving the wife to handle everything alone. The wife is clearly upset, feeling overwhelmed and not getting a break. The husband feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year thing.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife's role as a SAHP is demanding, especially with two young kids. The husband's work schedule is already taking time away from home, and on weekends he's usually a big help. By leaving for 4 days, he's removing his support system from the wife. Even if it's once a year, the impact on the wife might be significant. The key factors here are the balance of responsibilities and mutual support in the marriage.\n\nThe husband might think he's making a personal sacrifice for self-care, but if the wife is the primary caregiver and has no break, that could be unfair. The fact that the wife has expressed her discomfort, and the husband acknowledges her exhaustion, suggests that her well-being is important. The question is whether the husband's need for a weekend trip outweighs the wife's need for support. Since the wife doesn't get a break and is already stressed, the husband's decision might not consider her perspective adequately. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering the wife's feelings and the additional burden placed on her. The answer would be A.\n"
