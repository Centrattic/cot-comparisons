On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that he's going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle their two young kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and he works long hours and sometimes travels, so he's already not around much. The husband feels bad but thinks it's just one weekend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework, which can be really draining, especially with two young children. The husband does help on weekends, but now he's taking a four-day break. The wife has clearly expressed that this is too much for her. \n\nFrom the wife's perspective, having her husband travel for four days might mean she doesn't get any break. She's already exhausted from the week, and the weekend is her only time to rest. The husband might think it's a small sacrifice, but if the wife is overwhelmed, this could add to her stress. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions he works long hours and sometimes travels for work. Maybe the wife is already used to handling things alone during the week, but the weekend is typically their time to share responsibilities. Taking that away might not be fair to her. \n\nHowever, the husband is also trying to maintain his own well-being by having some time with friends. It's important for him to have personal time, but maybe the timing or duration is an issue. The key point is communication. If the wife has made it clear that this is a problem, then the husband should consider her feelings and adjust his plans. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. Even if the husband feels he's doing something to recharge, if it's causing his wife additional stress, it might not be the right decision. The fact that the wife is exhausted and has communicated her discomfort suggests that the husband should prioritize her needs in this case. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband might be in the wrong because he's adding to his wife's burden without adequately addressing her concerns. Even though he's trying to balance his own needs, the wife's input should be a priority here. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
