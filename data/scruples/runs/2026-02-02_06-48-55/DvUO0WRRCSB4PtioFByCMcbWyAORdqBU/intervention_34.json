On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, which means she's already managing most of the childcare and household duties. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so he's not around much. On weekends, he helps out with the kids and chores. This time, he's leaving for four days, which the wife finds too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The husband is working long hours and comes home on weekends to help. The wife is doing most of the work, which can be draining. But when he takes time off for a festival, it's understandable that the wife feels overwhelmed. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. \n\nThe husband mentions feeling bad but justifying it as a once-a-year break. However, the wife clearly communicated that 4 days was too much. Even if it's a long weekend, the duration might be an issue because of the young children. A baby and a 4-year-old require constant attention, so leaving the wife alone for four days could be really stressful. \n\nI should also think about the fairness of the arrangement. The husband helps on weekends, but when he's away, the wife is left with all the responsibilities. Maybe they need to plan better for such trips, like getting help or adjusting the schedule. The fact that the wife made it clear she didn't want him to go suggests that her needs were not considered in the decision, which could make the husband at fault for not respecting her input.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is taking a break, which is important for his well-being. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the wife's needs and the children's well-being are being neglected, then maybe he is. The answer might hinge on whether the husband should have prioritized his wife's situation over his own plans. Since the wife expressed discomfort and he went anyway, it's possible he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A because he didn't consider his wife's needs when she clearly communicated her concerns. Self-care is important, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the family's well-being without discussion and support.\n"
