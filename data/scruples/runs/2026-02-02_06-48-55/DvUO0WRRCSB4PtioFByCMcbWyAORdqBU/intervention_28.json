      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for leaving his wife with the kids for a long weekend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, which already leaves his wife handling most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, he usually helps out by spending time with the kids and cooking. But this time, he's going to a music festival from Thursday to Sunday, four days away. The wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young children (4 and 1.5 years old), which is a lot of work. The husband feels bad but thinks one weekend a year is okay. However, the wife says four days is too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the wife is already shouldering a huge workload, the kids are very young, and the husband is taking a four-day trip when he usually helps on weekends. Even though he's taking a break once a year, the timing and duration might be causing more stress for the wife. \n\nI need to consider if the husband's actions are reasonable. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, which means she's managing everything full-time. If the husband is taking four days off, that's doubling the usual weekend break. The fact that the wife is exhausted and the husband is leaving her without support for four days could be seen as adding to her stress. \n\nAlso, the fact that the wife has made her feelings clear about it being too much suggests that communication was considered. However, the husband might not have realized how much this would impact her. But the key here is that the decision was made without considering her input or the practicalities of her situation. Even if it's once a year, if it's causing her significant stress, maybe it's not the right choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is taking a break to recharge, which is important for his well-being. But since his usual routine includes helping out on weekends, his absence for four days might create an imbalance. The question is whether a four-day trip is a reasonable break or if it's too much given the circumstances.\n\nI think the husband is in the wrong because he's adding to his wife's burden by leaving for four days, especially when she's already overworked. Even if it's once a year, the duration and timing might not be considerate enough. The answer would be A.\n"
