On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids, is in the wrong. The wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young children, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps out, but this time he left for four days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, which already takes time away from family. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework. Even though the husband helps on weekends, he's now taking four days off, which the wife finds too much. She's exhausted from the week and doesn't get a break.\n\nThe key points here are the balance of responsibilities and communication. The husband feels it's a once-a-year break, but the wife clearly communicated that four days is too much. The fact that she's a stay-at-home parent with two young kids means her workload is significant. Taking a four-day trip might leave her without support, especially since he usually helps on weekends.\n\nEven though the husband might feel he needs a break, the impact on his wife seems more severe. The wife's exhaustion is a valid concern. Since they've been married for six years, maybe there's a history of his work affecting their family time. The husband could have considered alternative solutions, like arranging for extra help or choosing a shorter trip. The fact that he didn't consider her perspective and went ahead might make him at fault.\n\nAlso, the wife's clear dissatisfaction indicates that her needs weren't prioritized. The husband's action, while a personal need for a break, might have disregarded her feelings and the practical challenges she faces. So, considering the communication and the impact, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
