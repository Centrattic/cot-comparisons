On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for going on a long weekend with friends, leaving his wife with the kids. The context is that the wife is a stay-at-home parent, they have two kids, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. The husband usually helps on weekends, but this time he's going out of town for four days, which the wife is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework, which is a lot. The husband does help on weekends, but this weekend he's leaving her to manage everything alone for four days. The wife is exhausted and finds it hard to get a break, which the husband acknowledges. He feels bad but thinks it's just one time. The wife, however, says it's too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, from a fairness perspective, the wife is already overburdened. The husband's absence means she has no respite, which can affect her well-being and their family life. Even if it's a rare event, if the wife feels it's too much, respecting her feelings is important. Communication between them might be key here. If the husband didn't discuss the trip first, that could be a problem. But even if he did, her valid concerns about her workload and need for support might mean that his decision was not considerate enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband works long hours and does contribute on weekends. Taking a break for self-care is understandable. However, the duration (four days) might be excessive if it's causing significant stress for his wife. The balance between personal time and family responsibilities is tricky. Since the wife is the primary caregiver, her input should be a major factor in such decisions.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support is crucial. If the husband is taking time for himself without considering the impact on his wife, especially when she's already stretched thin, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the wife made it clear she's against it suggests that he should have heeded her concerns more. The husband's reasoning that it's a one-time thing might not address her ongoing feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his wife's well-being and existing workload, even if it was a rare occurrence. The decision to leave for four days without sufficient support for his wife could be seen as selfish or dismissive of her needs.\n"
