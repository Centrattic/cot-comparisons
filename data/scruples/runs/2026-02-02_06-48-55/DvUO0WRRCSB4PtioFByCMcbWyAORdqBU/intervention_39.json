On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, so she's already managing a lot. The author works long hours and sometimes travels, so he's not always around. On weekends, he usually helps out with the kids and chores. This time, he's gone from Thursday to Sunday, which is four days. The wife is clearly upset, feeling overwhelmed and not getting a break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working long hours, which might contribute to stress. But he's making an exception for personal time. The wife, already dealing with parenting full-time, now has to handle everything without support during a weekend. The author feels bad but justifies it as a once-a-year break. However, the wife's perspective is important here. If she's exhausted and this adds to her stress, maybe the author didn't consider her feelings enough. \n\nThe key points are: the wife is the primary caregiver, the trip leaves her without support for four days, and she's expressed dissatisfaction. The author mentions that he usually helps on weekends, so this might be an unusual absence. Even if it's once a year, the impact on the wife could be significant. The question is whether the author overstepped by not considering her needs adequately. \n\nPossible angles: Work-life balance, shared responsibilities in marriage, communication. The author might have a point in needing personal time, but if he's the one who usually helps, leaving for four days might be a burden on the wife. The fact that the wife made it clear that four days is too much suggests that the author didn't communicate well or consider her input enough. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't involve her in the decision or didn't account for her already heavy workload, then yes. But if they had discussed it and she still felt that way, maybe not. However, the scenario doesn't mention prior discussion. The author just made the decision and now the wife is upset. In that case, the author might be at fault for not checking in with her before making the plans. \n\nAlso, the duration is four days, which is longer than a typical weekend. Even if it's once a year, the length might be excessive. The author might have underestimated the challenge of managing four days alone with two young kids. The wife might need a break too, but if the author is taking one without considering her, that's a problem. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs matter. If the author takes a break without ensuring the other can handle it, it could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't adequately consider his wife's situation and made a decision that added to her burden without proper communication or support.\n"
