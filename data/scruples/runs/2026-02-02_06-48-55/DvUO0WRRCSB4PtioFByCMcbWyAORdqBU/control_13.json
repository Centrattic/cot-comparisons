      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife to handle the kids alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The couple has been married 6 years, together 10. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with two kids, 4 and 1.5 years old. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps with parenting and housework. This time, he went on a 4-day trip, Thursday to Sunday, which is a long weekend for a music festival. His wife is exhausted and upset because she has to manage everything alone, and he left her without a break.\n\nThe husband feels bad but thinks it's once a year. The wife says it's too much and he made the wrong decision. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI should evaluate the balance of responsibilities. The wife is already handling most of the parenting and housework during the week, and the husband's weekend help is crucial. If he's away for four days, that's taking away the only time she gets support. The kids are young, which means they require a lot of attention and care. Leaving a stay-at-home mom with two young kids for four days without help could be overwhelming, especially if she's already exhausted from the week.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The husband didn't consider his wife's feelings and the impact on her. Even if it's a rare trip, the fact that the wife clearly communicated that it's too much suggests that he should have prioritized her needs. The husband's reasoning that it's once a year might not outweigh the immediate stress and strain on his wife. \n\nIn such situations, mutual support is important in a marriage. If the husband is overworked and needs a break, maybe he should have arranged for help during the trip, like a babysitter or family member to assist. But leaving without any support could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the husband is in the wrong because he didn't consider his wife's well-being and the practical challenges she faces when he's away, especially given their current family situation.\n"
