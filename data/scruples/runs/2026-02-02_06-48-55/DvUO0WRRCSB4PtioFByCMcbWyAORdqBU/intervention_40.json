On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went on a weekend trip without considering their wife's feelings is in the wrong. The scenario is that the wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young kids, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. On weekends, he helps out, but this time he went away for four days. The wife is exhausted and feels overwhelmed, and she's upset about his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework alone during the week, and the husband is only helping on weekends. Even though he helps on weekends, leaving for four days might add to her stress. The key here is communication. Did they discuss this trip beforehand? If he went without consulting her, that's a problem. The fact that she made it clear she was against four days away suggests that maybe he didn't consider her input properly.\n\nAlso, the kids are very young\u20144 and 1.5 years old. Young children require a lot of attention, and having the parent stay home is crucial. If the husband is unavailable for four days, the wife is left with all the responsibilities. Even if he helps on weekends, a four-day absence could be more than she can handle, especially if she's already exhausted from the week.\n\nAnother point is the reason for the trip. A music festival is a personal leisure activity. While it's understandable to want a break, the husband's decision to prioritize his own time over his wife's needs and the kids' stability might not be considerate. The wife might feel neglected or overburdened, which can affect the relationship.\n\nHowever, the husband does mention that it's only once a year and that he feels bad. He's aware of the impact but decided to go anyway. The question is whether the trip's benefits outweigh the stress on the wife and kids. Since the wife is clearly upset and it's a significant time away, it might be inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, considering each other's needs is important. The husband's action, while perhaps understandable, may have overlooked his wife's current situation. The fact that she made her concerns known and he still went suggests a lack of regard for her feelings. So, he might be in the wrong for not accommodating her needs and not ensuring there's proper support in place during his absence.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his wife's well-being adequately and went on a trip that added to her stress without proper support.\n"
