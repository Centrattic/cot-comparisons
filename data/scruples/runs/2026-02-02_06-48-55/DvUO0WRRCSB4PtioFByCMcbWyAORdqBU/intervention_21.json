On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone.\n\nFirst, the setup: They've been married 6 years, together 10. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with two young kids (4 and 1.5 years old). The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so the wife does most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, he does help out. This time, he's going away for four days to a music festival with a friend. The wife is exhausted and feels she's not getting a break. She's upset, saying the four days away is too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is to agree or disagree.\n\nSo, considering the dynamics here. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, which is a big responsibility, especially with two young kids. The husband's work hours are long, and he sometimes travels. On weekends, he helps, but this time he's absent. The key point is that the wife is struggling and the husband's absence adds to her stress. Even though he takes time off to help on weekends, this particular trip leaves her with no support. The duration is four days, which is longer than a typical weekend. The wife clearly communicated her feelings about this being too much, so the husband didn't consider her input adequately. \n\nThe husband feels bad but justifies it as a once-a-year trip. However, the wife's needs and the children's need for attention might be more critical. The fact that she's exhausted and not getting a break means that his decision, while he might find it necessary for himself, is causing her additional strain. The balance of partnership here seems to tip towards the husband not considering his wife's well-being enough in this case. So, he's in the wrong for not respecting her situation and the impact on their family.\n"
