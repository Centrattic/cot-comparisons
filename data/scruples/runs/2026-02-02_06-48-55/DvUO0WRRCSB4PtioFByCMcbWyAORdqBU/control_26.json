On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the author works long hours and sometimes travels. On weekends, he helps with the kids, cooking, etc. This time, he's going Thursday to Sunday for a music festival. His wife is upset because she's already exhausted and he's leaving her with the kids again. He feels bad but thinks it's just one weekend.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the wife's responsibilities and the author's absence. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework, which is a lot, especially with two young kids. The author is working long hours and sometimes traveling, so maybe he's already not around much. The weekend is supposed to be their time to help out, but he's leaving again. \n\nHe argues it's only once a year and he feels bad, but his wife clearly thinks it's too much. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, maybe the author should consider his wife's feelings and the fact that she's already overwhelmed. Even if it's once a year, if it's causing her stress, maybe he should have made a different choice. On the other hand, taking a break for self-care is important too. But the wife's needs might be more pressing here. \n\nThe author's work schedule is already heavy, but weekends are crucial for family time. If he's leaving on the weekend, that's when the wife gets rest. If he's gone, she's stuck with everything. Maybe he should have arranged for help or found a different time to go. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because he's adding to his wife's burden when she's already struggling.\n"
