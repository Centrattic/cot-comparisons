On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who went on a weekend trip with friends is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple with two young kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. This time, he went from Thursday to Sunday, leaving his wife with all the responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is a stay-at-home mom, which is a full-time job, especially with two young children. The husband works long hours already, so maybe he's trying to get a break. But going away for four days might add to the wife's stress. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe husband mentions that he usually helps out on weekends, so this trip is a departure from that. The wife is clearly upset, finding four days too much. The key point is the communication and agreement between partners. If the wife didn't agree to this and feels overwhelmed, then maybe the husband should have checked in more or adjusted his plans. Even if it's a rare break for him, the impact on the wife is significant. The children are 4 and 1.5, so their needs are considerable. Leaving the wife alone with them for four days without the usual support might be too much, especially if the husband isn't there to share the load.\n\nAlso, considering that the wife is already exhausted from the week, not having a break over the weekend exacerbates the problem. The husband's intention might be to take a break, but the effect on the family unit is crucial. Partners need to communicate and find a balance. If the husband went without discussing properly or didn't consider the wife's workload enough, that's a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband did consider but felt it was a one-time exception. However, the wife's reaction shows it's a big deal for her. So, even if it's a rare trip, the husband should have been more mindful of her feelings and responsibilities. The fact that he acknowledges her exhaustion and the stress but still went might indicate he didn't prioritize her needs enough. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities and empathy are key. If the husband is working long hours already, maybe the wife is already stretched thin, and adding a four-day weekend away without mutual agreement isn't fair. The answer would lean towards AITA being on the husband's side if he didn't adequately consider his wife's perspective and the practical challenges she faces alone. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
