On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps out with the kids and housework.\n\nSo, this time he went away for four days to a music festival. The wife is exhausted and feels like she doesn't get a break. The husband feels bad but thinks it's once a year. The wife says it's too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the balance between work, personal time, and family responsibilities. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, which already puts a strain on the wife. The fact that he's a stay-at-home parent suggests she's the primary caregiver, handling most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, he usually helps out, but this time he's absent for four days. \n\nThe wife's exhaustion is a big factor. Even if the husband is usually there on weekends, this absence might be adding to her stress. The husband argues it's just one weekend a year, but from the wife's perspective, having four days without any help could be overwhelming, especially with two young kids. The fact that she made it clear it's too much indicates that her needs weren't considered adequately.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he did leave his wife in a tough situation when he knows she's already overworked. Even if it's a rare escape for him, prioritizing his own break over her well-being might not be fair. Communication is also key here. Did they discuss this beforehand? If he went without considering her input, that's a problem. Since the wife expressed her disapproval after the fact, maybe he should have checked in more thoroughly before making the decision.\n\nOn the other hand, he does contribute on weekends when he's available, so it's not like he's neglecting his responsibilities all the time. But in this specific case, taking four days off might be too much. Maybe he could have arranged for extra help or adjusted his plans to be more considerate of her situation. The fact that he feels bad suggests some awareness, but actions still caused her distress.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the husband might be in the wrong because he didn't adequately consider his wife's already heavy workload and the impact of his absence. Even if it's a rare trip, the decision to leave for four days without ensuring her needs are met could be seen as selfish.\n"
