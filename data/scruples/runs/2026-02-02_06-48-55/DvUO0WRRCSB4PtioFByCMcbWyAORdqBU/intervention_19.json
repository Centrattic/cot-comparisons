      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is married to a stay-at-home parent with two young kids. They work long hours and sometimes travel, which leaves their wife handling most of the parenting and housework. On weekends, they do help out. This time, they decided to go on a 4-day trip with a friend to a music festival, from Thursday to Sunday. Their wife is exhausted and feels like she's not getting a break. She's upset and thinks the decision was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, which means she's managing the household and children full-time. The husband works long hours and travels, so when he's home, he helps on weekends. The trip is during the weekend and into the week, which is when he usually helps. By leaving for four days, he's removing his support during a time when the wife already has a heavy load. \n\nThe key points are: the wife is exhausted, the children are young (4 and 1.5 years old), and the husband is taking a significant amount of time away, which might be the first time he's doing something like this. The wife has explicitly said she's not okay with it, which suggests that communication was part of the issue. \n\nOn one hand, the husband might feel he needs a break too. But the wife's role is demanding, especially with two young kids. The husband's absence adds to her stress. Even though he helps on weekends, four days is a lot. The wife's reaction is valid because she's already stressed. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is at fault. Arguments against him could be that he didn't consider his wife's feelings enough or didn't communicate properly. Arguments in his favor might be that he's working hard and needed a break. But given the wife's situation and her direct disapproval, it seems the husband's decision prioritized his personal time over her well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is more likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't adequately consider the impact on his wife and her clear objection was dismissed.\n"
