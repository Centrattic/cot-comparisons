On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids, is in the wrong. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours. He usually helps on weekends, but this time he left for four days. The wife is clearly upset because she's overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. That's already taking time away from family. On weekends, he does help with parenting and housework. This time, he took a four-day trip, leaving his wife alone with two young kids. The kids are 4 and 1.5 years old, which are tough ages. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, so she's dealing with all the responsibilities without the help of the husband during his absence.\n\nNow, the husband feels bad but justifies it as a one-time break. The wife feels it's too much. The key points here are about shared responsibility and communication. If the husband usually helps on weekends, taking four days off might be a significant burden on the wife. Even if it's a rare event, the impact on his wife is real. Maybe they should have discussed it beforehand and found a solution, like getting help or adjusting plans. The fact that the wife made it clear she's against it suggests there was a lack of communication or consideration. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not adequately addressing his wife's feelings and the practical implications of his absence.\n"
