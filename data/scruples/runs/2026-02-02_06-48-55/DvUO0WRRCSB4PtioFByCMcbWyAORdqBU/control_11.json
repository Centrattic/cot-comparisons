      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is married with two young kids, a 4-year-old and a 1.5-year-old. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, handling most of the parenting and housework. The author works long hours and sometimes travels for work, leaving the wife to manage everything. On weekends, he usually helps out, doing things like spending time with the kids and cooking. This time, he decided to go on a long weekend trip with a friend to a music festival from Thursday to Sunday. The wife is exhausted and upset because she has to handle everything alone again. She said four days is too much and he made the wrong decision. He feels bad but thinks it's just one weekend a year.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamics. The wife is a stay-at-home parent with two young children. That's a lot of work, especially with a toddler. The husband works long hours during the week and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps, which is good. But this time, he's leaving for four days. The wife is already tired from the week and then has no break over the weekend. He feels bad but justifies it as once a year. \n\nI think the key points here are the wife's feelings and the balance of responsibilities. Even though the husband is trying to help on weekends, he's now absent for four days. The wife is the primary caregiver, and the husband's absence might be adding to her stress. He might be overestimating how much help he provides. Maybe he's not considering how much his wife is handling alone. The fact that she said it's too much and he made the wrong decision shows there's a disagreement. \n\nOn the other hand, taking a break once a year for personal reasons could be seen as reasonable. But with a 1.5-year-old, four days without a break might be really hard. The wife probably needs rest and support. If the husband is taking a break, maybe he should consider if his wife can get any respite as well. Perhaps he could have arranged for some help or considered a shorter trip. \n\nThe main issue is the balance between personal time and family responsibilities. The husband might be thinking that once a year is manageable, but the wife is the one dealing with the day-to-day stress. If he's not there to help even on weekends, maybe he's not sharing the load as much as he thinks. The fact that he left for four days might be a mistake because it's impacting his wife negatively. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his wife's perspective enough and his absence is adding to her burden. Even though he's taking a break, his wife is left alone, which might not be fair. Maybe he could have planned the trip differently or communicated better to ensure his wife isn't overwhelmed.\n"
