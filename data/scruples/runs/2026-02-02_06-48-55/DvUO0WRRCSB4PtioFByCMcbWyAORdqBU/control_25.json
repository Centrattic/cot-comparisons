On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The man is considering whether he's in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. His wife is a stay-at-home mom for two young children, which is a lot of work and stress. He works long hours and sometimes travels, so he's already away from home part of the time. On weekends, he usually helps with the kids and housework.\n\nThe trip is from Thursday to Sunday, which is four days. He feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year thing. His wife is clearly upset, saying it's too much and that he made the wrong decision. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their marriage. The wife is managing all the responsibilities alone during the week and now the weekend. The husband does help on weekends, but if he's leaving for four days, that's a significant gap. The kids are 4 and 1.5, so they need a lot of attention and care. The wife is already exhausted, and this trip removes the husband's usual weekend support.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and balance. The husband should have discussed this trip with his wife before making the decision. If he went ahead without considering her feelings, that's a problem. Also, the trip is four days, which is more than a typical weekend, so it's a longer absence. Even if it's once a year, it's a significant amount of time.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important here. She's the one handling all the childcare and housework, which can be overwhelming. If the husband is traveling for work, that's part of his job and he's expected to do that. But taking a personal trip for leisure when he's already working long hours might be seen as selfish, especially if it adds to his wife's burden.\n\nHowever, the husband does contribute on weekends, so maybe he's trying to balance things. But four days is a lot. The wife's exhaustion is a valid concern. It's possible that the husband didn't fully understand the impact of his absence. The fact that the wife made it clear it was too much suggests that he should have listened to her and found a different way to enjoy his time off without leaving her in such a difficult spot.\n\nIn relationships, teamwork is crucial. Both partners need to support each other. If the husband is taking a trip that causes his wife additional stress, especially when she's already under a lot of pressure, that could be seen as the wrong decision. The husband's intention might be to have a break, but the effect on his wife is negative. The question is whether the husband considered his wife's feelings and situation before making the trip. If he didn't communicate properly or consider the impact, then he's at fault. If he did and still decided to go, there might be different perspectives. But given that the wife was upset and it's a four-day absence, the answer leans towards the husband being in the wrong.\n"
