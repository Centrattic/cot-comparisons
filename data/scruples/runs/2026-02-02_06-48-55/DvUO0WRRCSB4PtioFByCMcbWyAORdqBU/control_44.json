On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left their wife with the kids for a long weekend is in the wrong. The context is that the wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young kids, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. On weekends, he usually helps with the kids and chores. This time, he went to a music festival for four days, and the wife is upset because she's exhausted and didn't get a break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband argues that it's just one weekend a year and that he usually helps on weekends. The wife feels it's too much, especially since he's often away for work. The kids are 4 and 1.5 years old, which is a tough age for a stay-at-home parent. Young kids require a lot of attention, so four days without the father might be really hard on the mother.\n\nThe husband might feel he needs a break too, but the wife is already handling most of the responsibilities. The fact that he's been traveling for work and leaving her during the week adds to the issue. Even though he helps on weekends, he's now taking that time away as well. The wife's exhaustion is valid, and the husband's actions might not be considering her workload. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone needs some personal time. But the key here is the impact on the wife. If the wife has made it clear that four days is too much, then the husband should respect her feelings. Maybe he could have found a way to support her instead of leaving, like arranging for help or adjusting his plans. \n\nSo, the husband might be in the wrong because he didn't consider his wife's needs and the strain it would put on her. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
