On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving his wife with the kids for a long weekend.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is married with two young children. His wife is a stay-at-home parent, handling most of the parenting and housework. He works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he usually helps out, but this time he's going away for a music festival from Thursday to Sunday. His wife is exhausted and feels it's too much, but he thinks one weekend away is okay.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the wife is already managing everything during the week. The author's absence means she has no break over the weekend. Even though he does help on weekends normally, this trip removes that support. His wife's feelings are valid\u2014she's stressed and needs the weekend to recharge. The author acknowledges feeling bad but justifies it as a one-time thing. However, the impact on his wife is significant. The question is about whether his actions are wrong, not just if they're inconvenient.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. The wife expressed her concerns clearly, and the author went ahead anyway. Even if he feels it's a necessary break for himself, prioritizing his needs over his wife's well-being when she's already stretched thin could be seen as selfish. The fact that this is a 4-day trip adds to the strain. While everyone needs personal time, the balance here seems tipped in the author's favor, causing stress on his wife. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering his wife's situation enough and not finding a compromise.\n"
