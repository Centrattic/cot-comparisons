      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife alone with their two young kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and he works long hours, sometimes traveling for work. On weekends, he helps out with the kids and housework.\n\nSo, the key points here are the frequency and duration of his absence. He's away for four days, which is a long weekend, leaving his wife to handle everything alone. The wife is exhausted from the week and the kids are young, which can be really demanding. The husband mentions that it's only once a year, but the wife clearly feels it's too much and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so maybe he's trying to take a break. But with two young children, the need for consistent support is high. Even if he helps on weekends, leaving for four days might be more than the wife can handle, especially if she's already stressed from the week.\n\nThe wife's feelings are important here. She's the one dealing with the day-to-day parenting and housework. If she's exhausted and needs a break as much as he does, then taking away her only weekend off might be unfair. The husband might not realize how much the four days away add up, even if it's once a year. Also, communication is key. Did they discuss the plans beforehand? If the wife didn't agree, then going ahead might be inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle is that the husband is trying to maintain his personal well-being by taking a break. But with young kids, the parent's well-being is also crucial. If the wife is overburdened, it could lead to resentment or burnout. The husband might need to find a middle ground, like a shorter trip or arranging help for his wife during his absence.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at how fair the actions are to all parties involved. The husband's actions, while understandable for self-care, might be seen as neglecting his wife's needs. The fact that the wife is clear that four days is too much and he's still going suggests he might be in the wrong. However, if he had arranged for someone to help or if it was a rare occurrence, maybe not. But since it's four days and she's a stay-at-home parent with two young kids, the balance tips towards him being in the wrong.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because leaving his wife alone for four days with young kids, when she's already exhausted, is placing a significant burden on her without considering her capacity to handle it. The husband should have either avoided the trip or made arrangements to ensure his wife gets support.\n"
