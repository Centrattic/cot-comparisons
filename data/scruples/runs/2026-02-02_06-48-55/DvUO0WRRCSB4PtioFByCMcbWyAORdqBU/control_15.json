      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for going on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young children. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so the wife is doing most of the childcare and housework. On weekends, he helps out.\n\nSo the situation is that he took a 4-day trip (Thursday to Sunday) to a music festival. The wife is exhausted from the week and then has the entire weekend alone with the kids. He feels bad but thinks it's once a year. The wife says it's too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the frequency and the impact. The husband is working long hours and sometimes traveling, which already puts a lot on the wife. The weekend he leaves, he's not there to help, so she's handling everything alone. The kids are very young, 4 and 1.5 years old, which is a tough age for parents. They probably need a lot of attention, maybe naps, meals, etc. A 1.5-year-old is still a baby in terms of care needed.\n\nThe husband's defense is that it's a once-a-year thing. But if he's already working long hours and sometimes traveling, maybe this adds up to more than just a single weekend. The wife is already overburdened, and this weekend might be adding to her stress. Even if it's once a year, maybe the husband should have considered alternatives, like bringing the family along or finding a different time when the wife could have help.\n\nAlso, the wife's perspective is important. She's the one who's the primary caregiver, and she's the one who's exhausted. If she's made it clear that this is too much, maybe he should have listened more. The fact that he went anyway, even if he felt bad, might indicate that he didn't fully consider her situation.\n\nBut then again, everyone needs some personal time. The husband does help on weekends, so perhaps this is a reasonable break. But the duration being four days is significant. Maybe he could have communicated better, or arranged for help during the trip. However, he didn't mention that here. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the wife's exhaustion and the lack of support during the trip, the husband might be in the wrong for not fully considering her situation. Even if it's a once-a-year thing, the impact on his wife was significant. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he left his wife in a tough spot, even if he felt bad about it.\n"
