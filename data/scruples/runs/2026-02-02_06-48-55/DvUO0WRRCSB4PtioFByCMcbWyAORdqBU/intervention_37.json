On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who went on a weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids, is in the wrong. The wife is a stay-at-home parent with two young children. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, but on weekends he helps out. This time, he went for four days, which the wife found too much. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework. The husband is working a lot and maybe trying to take some time for himself. But the problem is that the wife is already overwhelmed, and this four-day absence adds to her stress. \n\nThe husband mentions feeling bad but justifies it as a one-time event. However, the wife clearly expressed that four days is too much. So, even if it's a rare break for him, the impact on her seems significant. \n\nI should think about balance in relationships. Both partners need time for themselves, but when there are young children, the responsibilities are high. If the husband is working long hours and then taking another long weekend, it might be straining the relationship. The wife's exhaustion is a key point here. \n\nAlso, communication is crucial. Did they discuss this plan beforehand? The husband says he decided to go, but the wife was upset. Maybe they didn't have a proper conversation about her feelings. \n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to assume that the wife can handle four extra days alone when she's already managing a lot? The husband helps on weekends, so taking away that support might be too much. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the husband considered his wife's needs and the impact of his absence. Even if he feels bad, the fact that his wife felt it was wrong suggests he might have overlooked her perspective. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because he prioritized his own break over his wife's well-being, despite her expressed concerns.\n"
