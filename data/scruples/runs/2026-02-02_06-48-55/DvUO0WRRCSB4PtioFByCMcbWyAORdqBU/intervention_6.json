On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels, so he tries to help on weekends. This time, he took off four days, which made his wife really stressed because she's exhausted. He feels bad but thinks it's only once a year. The wife says he made the wrong decision.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about balancing personal needs with the responsibilities of marriage and family. The husband is working a lot and trying to help on weekends, so maybe taking a break is reasonable. But the wife is the primary caregiver for two young kids, which is a huge responsibility. Four days without support could be overwhelming. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband isn't neglecting his responsibilities the entire time; he's working and helps on weekends. Going on a trip once a year might be a reasonable self-care choice. However, the wife's exhaustion is real, and four days might be too long without help. Communication is also important here. Did they discuss this beforehand? The wife didn't agree, so maybe the husband should have listened more to her feelings.\n\nBut then again, the husband might need time to recharge. The question is whether taking four days away is a valid self-care measure or if it's overstepping. The fact that the wife is a stay-at-home parent means she's handling a lot, and the husband's absence might add too much stress. If he's already working long hours, perhaps the weekends are the only time he can relax. But four days is a long time. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of mutual understanding and communication. The husband might not have considered how much the four-day absence would affect his wife. Even if he feels it's a small break, if it causes significant stress for her, maybe he should have found a middle ground, like taking a shorter trip or arranging help. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe a bit. He might not have fully considered his wife's perspective and needs. The answer could be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't account for her workload, but some might argue B (no) because he's also entitled to self-care. But given the wife's clear distress and his absence being longer than usual, the balance might tip towards A.\n"
