On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who went on a weekend trip is in the wrong. The scenario is that he's married with two kids, the wife is a stay-at-home parent. He works long hours and sometimes travels for work, leaving her with the kids. This time, he went on a 4-day trip to a music festival with a friend, from Thursday to Sunday. The wife is exhausted and feels it's too much, so he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to determine if he's in the wrong. The user already thinks he is, but wants confirmation. Let me break it down. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework, which is a lot, especially with two young kids. The husband's job already requires long hours and travel, but weekends are when he's usually helping out. This particular weekend, he's leaving for four days, which is more than a regular weekend. The wife is clear that it's too much and that he made a wrong decision.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the wife's workload, the husband's absence during a critical time (weekend when she's expecting support), and the duration of the trip. Even though he's taking time for himself, the wife is already stretched thin. The fact that she's a stay-at-home parent means she doesn't have time off, and the husband's absence removes any support she might have. \n\nI think the husband should have considered his wife's feelings and the practical implications of leaving for four days. Even if it's a one-time thing, the impact on his wife is significant. He might have acted without fully understanding her stress level. So yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his wife's needs and the family's situation in this instance.\n"
