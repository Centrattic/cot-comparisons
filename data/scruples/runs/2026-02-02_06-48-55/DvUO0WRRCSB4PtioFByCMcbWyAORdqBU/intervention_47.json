On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a long weekend trip with friends and leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, which adds to the pressure. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, so he's already leaving her a lot. The trip is from Thursday to Sunday, which is four days. The wife is upset because she's exhausted and doesn't get a break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is trying to balance his work and personal life, but he's also taking a personal trip. The wife is handling most of the parenting and housework. The key points are communication, the frequency of such trips, and whether the husband considered his wife's feelings beforehand.\n\nThe husband mentions that he generally helps on weekends, so this might be a deviation from his usual routine. However, the wife has already made it clear that four days is too much. The question is whether taking this trip is unreasonable given their circumstances. \n\nIn many relationships, it's important to have mutual support and understanding. If the wife is already overwhelmed, taking a four-day trip might be adding to her stress. Even if it's a rare occurrence, the impact on her is significant. The husband might have thought it's just once a year, but the wife's reaction suggests it's a problem. \n\nI think the husband didn't consider his wife's perspective adequately. Even if he feels bad, the fact that the wife explicitly said it's too much indicates that the decision wasn't made collaboratively. Relationships require compromise, and in this case, the husband might have prioritized his own needs over his wife's expressed needs. So, the answer might be A, that he's in the wrong.\n"
