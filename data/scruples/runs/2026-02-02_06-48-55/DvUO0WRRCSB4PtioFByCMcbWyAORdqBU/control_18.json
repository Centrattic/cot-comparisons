On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for going on a weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, so she's handling all the childcare and housework. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work, leaving her alone during the week. On weekends, he helps out with the kids and cooking.\n\nThis time, he's going away for four days to a music festival. He feels bad but thinks it's just once a year. His wife is upset because she's already stressed from the week and the weekend is their only time off. She says four days is too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife is managing everything alone during the week, the husband is trying to help on weekends, and now he's taking a break. The wife is clearly struggling, and the husband is trying to balance his own needs. But the problem is that the wife's needs are being overlooked. If the husband is already working long hours and not enough help on weekends, taking time off might be adding to her stress. Even though it's once a year, if the wife isn't getting any support during that time, it's not fair. The husband might not realize how much the weekend help is crucial for her. So, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he's not considering her situation properly. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the wife's needs are more pressing here, the answer is likely A.\n"
