      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving their wife with the kids, is in the wrong. The context is that the wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young children (4 and 1.5 years old), and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels for work. On weekends, he helps with parenting and housework. Now, he took a four-day trip, which the wife found too much, as she's already exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance between the husband's need for personal time and the wife's responsibilities. The husband mentions he's been helping on weekends, but this trip leaves her alone for four days. Two young kids are a lot, especially with the younger one being 1.5. The wife is a stay-at-home parent, so she's already shouldering most of the childcare and housework. The husband works long hours and sometimes travels, which might mean the wife is used to handling things alone during the week, but a four-day weekend is a significant stretch.\n\nThe key points here are communication and prior expectations. Did the husband and wife discuss this trip beforehand? The husband feels bad but thinks it's a once-a-year thing. However, the wife clearly communicated that four days was too much. If the husband didn't take her feelings into account despite her expressing concerns, that could be problematic. The fact that he's leaving her without support for an extended period might be seen as selfish, even if he usually helps on weekends.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is taking a break to recharge, which is important for his mental health. But with two young kids, a four-day absence might not be feasible. The wife might be overwhelmed, and the husband should consider that. Maybe there were alternative solutions, like bringing a relative or friend to help, or adjusting the trip to a shorter duration. The fact that the wife is already exhausted from the week adds to the stress.\n\nSo, the husband's decision might be seen as not fully considering his wife's situation. While it's important for him to have personal time, the length of the trip and the circumstances might make him at fault. The answer could hinge on whether there was a prior agreement about responsibilities and whether he prioritized his needs over hers without proper communication or support.\n"
