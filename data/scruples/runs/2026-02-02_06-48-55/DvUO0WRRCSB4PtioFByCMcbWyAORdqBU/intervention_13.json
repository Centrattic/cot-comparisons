On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a long weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids and housework. His wife is a stay-at-home parent for two young children. He works long hours and sometimes travels for work, and on weekends he helps out. This time, he went from Thursday to Sunday for a music festival. The wife is exhausted, and he feels bad but thinks it's a rare break. She said it was too much and he made the wrong decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with two young kids, which is a lot of work. The husband works long hours and travels, so maybe he's trying to balance his own needs. But he's leaving her alone for four days over the weekend. Even though he helps on weekends, this absence might be adding to her stress. The key point is whether the husband's decision was reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. The wife's feelings are valid; she's already managing a lot without help, especially since the kids are young. A four-day absence without support might be too much. The husband acknowledges feeling bad but justifies it as a one-time event. However, the wife's reaction is clear that she felt it was too much. Communication is important here. Did they discuss this beforehand? If the husband didn't consider her workload and made the decision unilaterally, that could be the issue. Also, the trip is for his own enjoyment, which might not take into account the family's needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband does contribute on weekends, and taking a break for self-care is important. But in this case, the timing and duration might be problematic. The fact that the wife is exhausted suggests that the husband's absence is compounding her stress. So, maybe the husband didn't consider the impact on his wife adequately. The answer might hinge on whether the husband made an effort to ensure the wife had support during his trip. If he didn't offer help or check in, that's a problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about considering the partner's perspective and responsibilities. Since the wife is the primary caregiver here, the husband's decision to leave her without support for four days could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if it's a rare break, the main issue is that he didn't account for her current stress and workload. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he prioritized his own needs without adequately considering his wife's situation.\n"
