On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband went on a weekend trip with friends, leaving his wife to handle the kids alone. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with two young children, and the husband works long hours and sometimes travels. He usually helps on weekends, but this time he left for four days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is already handling most of the parenting and housework during the week. The husband does help on weekends, but this time he's gone. The wife is exhausted, and he's aware of that. He's leaving her without support, which adds to her stress. Even though he feels bad, he still decided to go. The key points here are the wife's emotional and physical burden, the husband's usual support, and the timing of his trip.\n\nThe wife has made it clear that four days is too much. That's a direct communication from her that she's struggling. The husband might think it's a rare break for himself, but the impact on his wife is significant. Young kids need a lot of attention, and without help, the stay-at-home parent can feel overwhelmed. The husband's decision to leave might not be malicious, but it's inconsiderate given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's traveling for work sometimes but this is a personal trip might add to the perception that he's not sharing the load equally. The wife might feel like her needs are being neglected. Even though he's trying to balance by helping on weekends, skipping that support for a personal trip could be seen as selfish. The author might be in the wrong because he prioritized his own needs over his wife's well-being when she's already under a lot of stress. So, the answer would be A.\n"
