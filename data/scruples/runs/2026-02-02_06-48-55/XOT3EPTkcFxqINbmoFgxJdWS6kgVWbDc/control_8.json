I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, they're not married, but they live together. The fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter who's 19 and lives with them. The author and this stepdaughter have a bad relationship. He tried to be kind and make it better, but she's indifferent. He even bought her a car for her 16th birthday, but she didn't acknowledge him. Now, the author wants to kick her out because she's an adult and should be moving out on her own. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her living there, but the author wants her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19, in most places, she's an adult, so she can't be forced to leave unless there's a legal agreement. But if they live in a joint household, maybe the author isn't the landlord. If the author is the landlord, he might have the right to ask her to leave. But if he's a roommate or not the legal owner, then he can't just kick her out without her consent or a lease agreement. So legally, he might be in the wrong if he does it without proper cause or process.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions he tried to build a relationship but failed. He's frustrated because he wanted the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9e. However, the stepdaughter has a right to her own life. Even if she's an adult, she might need support, and the author's main motivation is his own desire for privacy. Is it fair to kick someone out just because it's convenient for him? The stepdaughter might not have the financial means to move out yet, even if she's working. The author's approach of being blunt and not caring about her reaction could be seen as harsh. He's using his fianc\u00e9e's wishes against her, maybe, since she wants her daughter there. That could cause marital problems too.\n\nAnother angle: The author's fianc\u00e9e is okay with the daughter staying, so maybe he's going against her wishes. Even though they're not married, they're in a committed relationship. Pushing her out without her agreement could strain their relationship. Also, the stepdaughter might have a different perspective. Maybe she's staying because of financial reasons or other support she needs. The author is assuming she can just move out, but that might not be realistic.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, if he doesn't have the authority to make her leave, he's in the wrong. Ethically, pushing her out for his own convenience without considering her situation and his fianc\u00e9e's views is questionable. Even if he has the legal right, doing it in a harsh way without empathy might make him ethically wrong. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong. But maybe B if he has legal standing and it's mutual. But the way he's phrasing it, he's not considering her needs, so probably A.\n"
