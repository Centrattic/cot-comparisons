I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9e, who isn't married but live together. The stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, works part-time, and the author is frustrated they haven't moved out. The key points here are the legal aspects and the dynamics of the family.\n\nSince the stepdaughter is an adult (19), legally, the author doesn't have the authority to force her out if she doesn't want to leave. They might be a landlord now, but if she's paying rent and following the terms of the agreement, they might need to follow proper eviction procedures. However, the author mentions that the stepdaughter hasn't moved out yet, possibly because she's not paying rent. If the house is owned by the author and fianc\u00e9e, they might have a lease agreement. If there's no formal lease, it could be more complicated.\n\nFrom a family dynamic perspective, the author's frustration is understandable. They've tried to build a relationship but feel ignored and want their privacy back. However, they have a duty of care, especially if the stepdaughter is still dependent. But since she's 19 and working, maybe she's more independent. But the author's approach is blunt and dismissive (\"don't care how she takes it\"), which could be seen as harsh. They should communicate with her directly, perhaps set boundaries, and maybe involve her mother if needed. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's wishes also matter. The author is considering her feelings but might be overriding her by pushing for the stepdaughter to leave. So, if the author doesn't have legal grounds and isn't approaching the situation respectfully, they could be in the wrong. But since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author might have the right to ask her to leave if it's their house. However, the method and communication matter. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on legal rights and how the author handles the situation. If the stepdaughter is a tenant, the author should follow proper procedures. If not, they might need to negotiate. The author's attitude is a bit harsh, but the core issue is about their right to ask her to leave. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, if they can legally do it and communicate properly, maybe not. But if they're being abrupt and disrespectful, maybe yes. But in the scenario, the author hasn't taken action yet, just contemplating. So the question is about the intention. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if they have the right, but A if they don't have legal grounds or are being inconsiderate. Need to check the legal aspect here. In many places, if the adult is a tenant, you can evict with proper notice. If she's not paying rent, it's more complex. If the house is owned by the author and fianc\u00e9e, and the stepdaughter isn't a tenant, they might not be able to evict her without cause. But since she's living there as a matter of family, maybe they can ask her to leave. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the way they're approaching it is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if they can ask her to leave, then no. But if they can't, then yes. The answer is likely B because the stepdaughter is an adult, and the author has the right to ask her to leave, but the manner is harsh. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's their house, but they could be wrong in the approach. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, so if they have the right, then answer is B.\n"
