I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The situation details that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author wants her to leave now that she's working.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: The stepdaughter is an adult, so there's no legal obligation for the author to provide housing. Legally, once a child turns 18, they're adults, and the family isn't required to support them. So the author isn't breaking any laws here.\n\nEmotional dynamics: The author mentions a strained relationship and feeling ignored in the past. They've tried to be kind but are tired of the situation. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, which the author feels is their choice. The author's fianc\u00e9 is supportive, which might help with the situation.\n\nEthical considerations: Even though it's legal, the ethical side is tricky. The author is the stepfather, but not a legal parent. However, if they've been providing financial support or housing, there might be an unspoken expectation. The author isn't obligated to keep her, but the stepdaughter might feel entitled due to the living arrangement. Also, the author's approach of not caring about her reaction could be seen as harsh, but they have the right to set boundaries in their own home.\n\nThe stepdaughter's perspective: She's choosing to stay, possibly relying on the financial stability the author's household provides. If she's not moving out, the author has the right to ask her to leave. The author's reasoning is about personal space and readiness for the stepdaughter to be independent.\n\nConclusion: Legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They can set boundaries in their home, especially with an adult who isn't their biological child. The stepdaughter's choice to stay doesn't obligate the author to keep her. So the answer is B (No).\n"
