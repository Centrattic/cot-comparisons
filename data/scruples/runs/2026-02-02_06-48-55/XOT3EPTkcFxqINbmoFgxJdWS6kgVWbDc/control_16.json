I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author wants her to leave. The couple isn't married but have been in a relationship for 8 years. The stepdaughter was bought a car, but she didn't acknowledge the author, leading to a strained relationship. The author feels they've given enough support and want her to move out now that she's working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's some sort of legal guardianship, which is unlikely. Legally, she can choose to stay or leave. So if the author tries to kick her out without her consent, that could be problematic. But maybe they're just considering telling her to leave, not forcing her, but the line between that can be blurry.\n\nNext, the ethical and social aspects. The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. However, the stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying. The author's fianc\u00e9 (his wife) seems to support her staying, which adds complexity. The author's motivation is wanting the house back for themselves and their partner, which is understandable but might be seen as selfish. On the other hand, the stepdaughter isn't a minor, so the author isn't responsible for her anymore. But she's staying with them by choice.\n\nPossible points to consider: Did the author have any agreement with the fianc\u00e9 about supporting the daughter? The fianc\u00e9's input is important here. If they agreed to support the daughter until she moves out, that's one thing. But if the author isn't part of that agreement, maybe they have the right to set boundaries. However, the stepdaughter isn't their biological child, so the responsibility might lie with the mother. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach of \"kicking her out\" might be harsh without considering alternatives.\n\nAlso, the stepdaughter is 19 and working. She might be saving money for her future. If the author pushes her out, it could disrupt her plans. The author's indifference to her reaction might come off as dismissive. There could be a better way to handle it, like setting financial boundaries or encouraging her to move out on her own terms.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author has no legal standing and is trying to force someone out of their home against their will, that's problematic. But if they're just setting expectations and the stepdaughter chooses to leave, it's different. The author's approach seems a bit abrupt and lacks empathy, which might make them in the wrong. However, they are not legally obligated to house an adult, so there's a balance here. The key is whether the author has a right to decide, which likely they don't, given the stepdaughter's age and autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they don't have legal authority to kick out an adult who's staying by choice, and the approach is dismissive of the stepdaughter's autonomy.\n"
