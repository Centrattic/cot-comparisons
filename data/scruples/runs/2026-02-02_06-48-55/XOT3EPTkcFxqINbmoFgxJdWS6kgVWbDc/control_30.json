I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The situation is that they're not married to their partner, who's been in a long-term relationship with the author. The stepdaughter lives with them, and the author wants her to move out now that she's working and 19.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult. Legally, she's not a minor, so there's no legal obligation for the author to provide her with housing. However, if she's still being financially supported or if there are any legal guardianship issues from the divorce, that might affect things. But the user mentioned the stepdaughter works, so maybe she isn't being supported financially.\n\nNext, the emotional and relational side. The author feels they tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. The stepdaughter was indifferent. The author's partner seems to be okay with her living there, but the author wants the house to themselves. The stepdaughter isn't planning to move out, so the author wants to push her out.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author has the right to their own home and privacy. However, abruptly kicking someone out without prior discussion might be seen as harsh. The author should consider the stepdaughter's situation\u2014does she have a place to go? Is she financially stable? Even though she's an adult, if she's been living with them for a while, sudden eviction could cause problems. The author's approach of not caring about her reaction might be seen as dismissive, which could be emotionally hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is about wanting the house to themselves. That's understandable, but it's important to balance personal needs with respect for others. Maybe the author should communicate with the stepdaughter first, set boundaries, and give her time to move out rather than just deciding to kick her out without discussion.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, they might be if they don't approach this with consideration. But legally, they're not wrong since the stepdaughter is an adult. However, the way they handle it matters. If they're just being selfish without considering the stepdaughter's feelings or circumstances, that could be seen as wrong. But if they're making a reasonable request for the stepdaughter to move out, given her ability to do so, it's more about personal choice.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to their home and the stepdaughter is an adult. However, there's a nuance in how they approach it. The key points are the legal right to ask someone out of the house and the ethical consideration of how to do it respectfully. Since the author is not a legal guardian and the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't in the wrong, but they should handle it with care.\n"
