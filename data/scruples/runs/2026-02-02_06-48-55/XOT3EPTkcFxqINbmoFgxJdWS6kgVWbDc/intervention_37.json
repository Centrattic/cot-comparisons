I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The author is in a long-term relationship with a woman who's not his wife, but they live together. The stepdaughter is 19, has her own job, and the author feels it's time she moves out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once someone turns 18 or 19, they're considered an adult. Unless there's a legal guardian relationship, the adult child isn't obligated to live with their parents. The stepdaughter here is working and saving money, so she's not a minor anymore. Legally, the author might not have authority over her living situation unless there are specific arrangements in place, which there's no mention of here.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The author mentions that the stepdaughter isn't close with him and has been indifferent. The author tried to build a relationship but gave up after the car incident. However, the mother (his fianc\u00e9) supports the daughter staying. This could lead to tension in the relationship if he goes ahead with kicking her out, especially if the fianc\u00e9 is upset about it.\n\nEthically, it's about mutual respect and consent. The author is part of a household where the stepdaughter is staying. If everyone knew she was planning to stay, maybe there was an implicit agreement. But the author now feels it's time she leaves. Since she's an adult and capable of moving out on her own, the author's right to enforce this is questionable unless there were prior agreements. However, the author might feel their own needs for space are valid after years of supporting her. \n\nBut pushing her out unilaterally without considering her wishes could be seen as disrespectful. The stepdaughter might want to stay for financial or other reasons, and the author not discussing it directly with her, but instead going through the mother, could be problematic. The author's statement that they don't care how she takes it shows a lack of consideration for her feelings, which might be where the ethical issue lies.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they're making a decision that affects another adult without mutual agreement. Even though the author has valid reasons, the method and lack of direct communication might be at fault. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
