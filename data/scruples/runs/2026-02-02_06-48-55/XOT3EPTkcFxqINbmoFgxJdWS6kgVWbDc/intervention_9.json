I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e (not married), and they live with her 19-year-old daughter. The author feels he's tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but hasn't succeeded. The daughter is an adult, works, and has the means to move out but chooses not to. The author wants her to leave because he wants privacy with his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's some form of lease or legal agreement in place. If she's an adult and paying rent, he can't just kick her out without following proper legal procedures. If she's not paying rent, maybe the situation is different, but the post doesn't mention that. The key point here is that the author is not her parent, so he doesn't have the legal right to make her leave. Any action would need to be through the legal system, like eviction if necessary.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has supported the stepdaughter financially (bought her a car), but she's now an adult. The author feels he's given enough and wants her to move out. However, the stepdaughter's mother (the author's fianc\u00e9e) is comfortable with her living there. The author is putting pressure on the fianc\u00e9e to move her out, which might affect their relationship. The author's approach could be seen as harsh, not considering the daughter's autonomy. Even if the author is frustrated, the way he's planning to handle it (without considering her feelings or the fianc\u00e9e's perspective) could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he doesn't care how she reacts, which suggests a lack of empathy. The stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying\u2014maybe financial instability, personal issues, or other factors. The author's decision might be abrupt and not taking into account her circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e might be caught in the middle, loving having her daughter there but also wanting to maintain the relationship with her partner.\n\nAnother angle: the author's fianc\u00e9e is the legal parent, so if there's a conflict, the mother has the authority to make decisions. The author's role is more of a step-parent, but without legal ties, he can't enforce rules that the mother is against. If the mother is supportive of the daughter staying, the author pushing to remove her could create tension in the relationship between the author and his fianc\u00e9e, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn summary, legally, the author might not have the right to force the daughter out. Ethically, his approach could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy and the mother's wishes. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not considering legal procedures and the emotional impact on others involved.\n"
