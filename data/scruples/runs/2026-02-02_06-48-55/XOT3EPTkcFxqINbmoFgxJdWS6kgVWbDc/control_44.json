I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who is the mother of an 19-year-old daughter. The daughter lives with them, and the author wants her to move out. The author feels like they've tried to build a relationship but have been ignored, especially when they gave a car for her 16th birthday and she didn't acknowledge them. Now that the daughter is 19 and working, the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The daughter is 19, which is an adult in most places. So legally, the parents (the author's fianc\u00e9 and her ex) might not have the authority to force her to leave. Unless there's some specific situation where she's still a dependent, but she's working and saving money. The author might be using their ownership of the house to kick her out, but if she's an adult and paying rent, that's different. If she's not paying rent, maybe the author can ask her to leave, but if she's part of the household, there might be some considerations.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author mentions that they've tried to build a relationship but were ignored. The daughter's behavior was indifferent. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants her to stay, but the author wants her to leave. The author isn't concerned about the daughter's reaction, which could be seen as dismissive. However, the daughter is an adult and should have the autonomy to decide where she lives. The author might be overstepping by trying to force her out without her consent.\n\nBut wait, the author is living with their fianc\u00e9, who is her mother. The mother's consent is part of the equation. However, the daughter is an adult, so even if the mother allows her to stay, the daughter has a right to choose. The author might not have the same authority as the mother. The author's argument is that they've supported her, but support is different from providing a place to live. If the daughter is staying in the house without paying rent, maybe the author is within their rights to ask her to leave, but if she's contributing or the mother is allowing her to stay, the author might be stepping over by unilaterally deciding to kick her out.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a non-married relationship with their fianc\u00e9. That might affect legal rights regarding property and who can ask who to leave. If the author is the property owner or has a lease, they might have more authority. But if they're cohabiting with their fianc\u00e9, the fianc\u00e9's rights also play a role. The mother might have a say in keeping the daughter at home, but the author is trying to override that. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is wanting the house to be just for them and their fianc\u00e9. That's understandable, but does that justify forcing an adult child out? It's a balance between their desire for privacy and the daughter's right to choose her living situation. The author's dismissive attitude towards the daughter's feelings (\"I don\u2019t really care how she takes it\") could be seen as inconsiderate or harsh. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while the author might have legal grounds, ethically, pushing an adult child out without considering her circumstances or wishes could be problematic. The daughter's choice to stay might be based on her own reasons, like saving money or personal preferences, which the author isn't considering. The author's approach seems abrupt and lacks communication, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because the daughter is an adult with her own rights, and the author is imposing their will without her consent, possibly overstepping their role as a partner rather than a parent. The author's fianc\u00e9's role in this is also important\u2014maybe she's the one who should address the daughter, not the author. The author's decision to act unilaterally without considering the daughter's autonomy could be the issue.\n"
