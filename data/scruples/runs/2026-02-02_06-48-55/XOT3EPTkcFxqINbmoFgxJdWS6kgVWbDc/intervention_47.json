I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with them and their fianc\u00e9, and the author wants to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The stepdaughter is 19, which means she's an adult. Legally, she's not a minor, so the author doesn't have parental authority over her. If she's an adult, she has the right to live where she wants. However, if she's still a dependent or if there's some legal arrangement, maybe the situation is different. But the question is more about moral or social wrong, not legal.\n\nNext, the author's relationship with the stepdaughter is strained. They tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The author gave up and now wants her to leave. The fianc\u00e9 (his partner) is okay with her staying, but the author wants her out. The stepdaughter has the financial means to leave, having a job and saving money.\n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. Since she's an adult, she has the right to choose where she lives. The author can't force her out unless there's a lease or rental agreement that allows that. If she's a tenant, the author might need to follow proper eviction procedures. But the author is considering doing it abruptly, which could be seen as unfair if done without considering her situation.\n\nThe author's main complaint is about wanting privacy with his fianc\u00e9. While that's understandable, it's not a valid reason to displace an adult who has the means to live independently. The author might feel justified, but from a moral standpoint, respecting her autonomy and choices is important. Also, the author's frustration is valid, but the method of addressing it (just kicking her out without discussion) could be harmful and disrespectful.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's opinion is also a factor. If the author acts unilaterally without consulting her properly, it might cause more conflict. The stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, like financial constraints or personal comfort. Even if she can afford to move out, she might not have the emotional support or resources to do so immediately.\n\nIn terms of ethics, pushing someone out without giving them a chance to make their own decisions could be seen as wrong. The author should communicate openly, set boundaries, and perhaps offer support for her to transition out. But outright evicting her without consideration might not be the right approach.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own desires over the stepdaughter's autonomy, especially when she's an adult and capable of making her own choices.\n"
