I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong when considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation properly. The author is in a long-term relationship, not married, living with their partner and her adult daughter. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and has been living at home even though the author hoped she'd leave after 18. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially after buying her a car. Now, they want her to move out, not caring about her reaction, and the fianc\u00e9 might be upset but it's for the best.\n\nSo, the key points are: the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't her parent, the author and their partner aren't legally married. The author wants her to leave because they want the house to themselves. The stepdaughter is working and saving money but hasn't moved out yet. The author is considering kicking her out, not just asking her to leave.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: since the author isn't the legal parent, they don't have the authority to evict a tenant. But is the stepdaughter a tenant? If she's paying rent, maybe, but if she's just living there for free, it's different. The author mentions she has enough savings to move out. If she's not paying rent, then the author can't just kick her out without legal procedures. But if she's considered a guest or family member, the rules might vary by location. However, since the author is not her legal guardian, they can't force her to leave without her consent or legal process.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author has tried building a relationship but felt rejected. They want their space back. But the stepdaughter is an adult, so the decision to stay or leave is hers. The author can't unilaterally decide to evict someone without proper legal steps. Also, the partner (fianc\u00e9) might be the one with more authority here, but the author is taking action without her full support, which could strain their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the partner might be the one who has a legal or moral responsibility to the daughter. The author's role is complicated because they aren't a legal parent. So, the author might be overstepping by trying to kick out someone who isn't their legal charge. Even if the partner is okay with it, the author can't just do it without considering the legal implications.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone is living in a home and isn't a tenant, the owner can ask them to leave. But if they don't pay rent, it's more complicated. The author might need to go through an eviction process, which could take time and legal action, which the author isn't considering. So, the author might be in the wrong for thinking they can just kick her out without proper process.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach seems somewhat dismissive of the stepdaughter's feelings and choices. While the author is frustrated, the stepdaughter is an adult who has chosen to stay. The author's solution is abrupt and not collaborative. Ethically, it's better to communicate and perhaps set boundaries rather than unilaterally deciding to remove someone from the home.\n\nPutting it all together: Legally, the author isn't in the position to evict the stepdaughter without proper legal procedures. Ethically, the author might be overstepping by not respecting the stepdaughter's choice to stay, even if they are an adult. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
