I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The key points here are the age of the stepdaughter, the living arrangements, and the relationships involved.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so she's not a minor. The author mentions that they bought her a car when she turned 16, which she didn't acknowledge, leading to a strained relationship. The author tried to build a relationship but eventually gave up. Now, the author wants her to leave because they want the house to themselves with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 (not legally married) is okay with the stepdaughter staying, but the author is frustrated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have the legal authority to force her out unless they're her legal guardian, which they don't seem to be. The mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) might be the legal parent, so the author's role is more of a partner, not a legal parent figure.\n\nEthically, even if the relationship is strained, the author is not her parent. The stepdaughter is choosing to live at home, and the author is the one who bought her a car. While the author might feel they've given enough support, the stepdaughter's choice to stay in her own home is her right. The author's desire for privacy and their own space is understandable, but kicking someone out without legal standing could be problematic. Also, the author's attitude of not caring about her reaction might be dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 might be the one who has the legal say in this matter, but the author is trying to take action. The author's approach might come off as harsh and possibly disrespectful, especially given the stepdaughter's age and adult status. There's a lack of considering other options, like discussing with the stepdaughter directly, setting boundaries, or compromising. The author's frustration is clear, but the method they're considering could be seen as wrong because it's not their place to decide where she lives unless there are legal implications they haven't mentioned.\n"
