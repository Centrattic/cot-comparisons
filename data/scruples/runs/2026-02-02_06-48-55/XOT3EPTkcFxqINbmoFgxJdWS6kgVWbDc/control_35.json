I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his adult stepdaughter. So the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, who has a 19-year-old daughter living with them. They've been together for 8 years, not married but live as married. The stepdaughter's relationship with the author is strained; he tried to be nice but she was indifferent. He bought her a car for her 16th, and she didn't acknowledge him. Now she's 19, working, and isn't moving out. The author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless he's her parent or guardian. The mother (his fianc\u00e9e) is the parent. If she's 19, in most places, she's an adult, so he can't just kick her out without her consent. The author might need to talk to the mother about this. The mother is the one who can decide if the daughter stays.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels the relationship is bad. He tried but she was indifferent. But he's using \"my fianc\u00e9e and I\" which implies he might be treating her as his own decision. But legally, it's the mother's decision. The author might not be in the wrong if he's not the parent, but if he's taking active steps to evict her without the mother's consent, that's a problem. The mother might be okay with her daughter staying. The author is also not considering the daughter's wishes. Even if she's an adult, she might want to stay, and the author is dismissing her feelings. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author says he doesn't care how she takes it, which is dismissive. But since he's not the parent, maybe he's overstepping. The answer hinges on whether the author has the right to make this decision. If the mother is okay with her daughter staying, then the author is wrong to try to kick her out. If the mother is on board, then maybe it's okay, but the author's approach might be harsh. The key is that the author isn't the parent, so he's not the one who should unilaterally decide. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's assuming authority he doesn't have.\n"
