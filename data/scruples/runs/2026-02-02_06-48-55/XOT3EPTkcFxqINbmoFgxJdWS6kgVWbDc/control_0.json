I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e (not married), and they live together. The fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter who is 19 and lives with them. The author tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but felt it was one-sided, especially after the car incident where the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge him. Now, the stepdaughter is working and saving, but hasn't moved out. The author feels it's time for her to leave so it's just him and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nSo, the main points here are the legal and ethical responsibilities. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, does the author have the right to ask her to leave? Legally, if she's 18 or older, she's an adult and can't be forced out by a stepparent unless there's some legal guardianship, which is unlikely unless she's still a minor or under some legal incapacity. The author isn't her parent, so he probably doesn't have authority over her living situation.\n\nEthically, the author might feel entitled because he's been supporting her, but once someone is an adult, they typically have the right to choose where they live. The author's frustration is understandable, but kicking her out without her consent could be seen as overstepping. The author's approach might be considered harsh, especially if communication was lacking. The stepdaughter might be taking advantage of the living situation, but that's not the author's responsibility to police unless there's an agreement in place.\n\nAlso, considering the fianc\u00e9e's role, if she's okay with the stepdaughter staying, the author is making a decision that affects the relationship dynamics. The author's disregard for her potential upset and the stepdaughter's reaction might be problematic. It's possible that the author is using the stepdaughter's age and ability to move out as justification, but forcing her out without mutual agreement could lead to conflict and legal issues.\n\nIn summary, the author is likely in the wrong because he doesn't have the legal authority to remove an adult from the household. Ethically, it's about respecting her autonomy. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
