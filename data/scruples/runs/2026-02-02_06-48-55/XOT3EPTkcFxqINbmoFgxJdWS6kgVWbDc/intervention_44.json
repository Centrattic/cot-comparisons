I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the WIBTA scenario) is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepdaughter is 19, which is an adult. The author is in a long-term relationship with her mother, but they're not married. The key point is that the stepdaughter is an adult, so the author's legal and moral obligations might be different compared to a minor.\n\nThe author mentions that they've tried to build a relationship but faced indifference. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out despite being able to work and save money. The author wants her to leave so they and their partner can have the house to themselves. The question is about whether this is wrong.\n\nNow, considering the stepdaughter's autonomy. Since she's an adult, she has the right to make her own decisions about where to live. The author can't just kick her out without cause unless there's some legal agreement. If she's paying rent or contributing, maybe there's a different angle. If she's staying without contributing, the author might argue she should move out. But the author's approach of being blunt and not caring about her reaction could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the mother (the author's partner) supports her living there, which complicates things. The author might be overstepping if they're not the legal guardian. The stepdaughter might feel it's her home as well since her parent (the author's partner) wants her there. \n\nLegally, unless there's a lease agreement or specific arrangements, the author might not have the legal right to evict her. Morally, while the author might feel frustrated, the stepdaughter's choice to stay and the mother's approval could mean the author is being unfair. The author's lack of concern for her feelings might come off as dismissive, which isn't ideal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has given her chances to move out, and she hasn't. The author might feel entitled to their space. However, the approach of pushing her out without her consent could be seen as disrespectful. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, adult children have the right to choose their living situation. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that autonomy.\n"
