I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult, 19 years old. The author and their fianc\u00e9e (who is the stepdaughter's mother) are in a long-term relationship but not married. The stepdaughter has been living with them. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially after getting her a car for her 16th birthday which she didn't acknowledge. Now that she's working, the author wants her to leave to have the house to themselves with their partner. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her living there, but the author is pushing for her to move out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: age, legal responsibility, and the dynamics of the household. Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult, so there's no legal obligation for the author to support her. The author isn't her parent, just a step-parent. The mother is the one who is her parent, so the author's role here is more of a housemate. If the author wants her to move out, it's their house, but they need to consider the terms of her living there. If she's been staying there without paying rent, maybe the author can set boundaries. However, if they haven't discussed this, it's possible they've been allowing her to stay under certain conditions.\n\nThe author mentions that the stepdaughter isn't saving enough and stays for the financial benefits. But the author is now saying she should move out. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the author isn't her guardian, they don't have the authority to make her leave. However, as a housemate, they can set terms for living arrangements. So if the author wants her to move out, they need to communicate that clearly. But if they've allowed her to stay without conditions, it's possible the author might be considered responsible for not setting those terms earlier.\n\nEthically, the author's frustration is understandable, but the approach of not caring how she reacts and pushing her out might be seen as harsh. However, since she's an adult, it's her choice whether to stay or leave. The author can't force her to leave unless there's a lease agreement or something in place. The mother (fianc\u00e9e) might have a different perspective, but she's her parent. The author's role is more of a housemate, so their right to kick someone out depends on their specific living arrangement.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because the stepdaughter is an adult, and the author isn't obligated to support her. However, they need to handle it correctly, maybe by setting clear expectations or discussing rent. Since the author is the one providing the living situation, they can ask her to leave, but they need to do it properly, not just assume they can kick her out without considering legal or ethical implications. But given the information, the author's desire to have their own space isn't wrong, and since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't legally responsible. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
