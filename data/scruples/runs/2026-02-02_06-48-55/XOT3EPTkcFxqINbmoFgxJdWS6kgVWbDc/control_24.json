I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9, they have an adult stepdaughter who lives with them. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and the author wants her to move out because he wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult. Legally, if she's not a minor, the author can't just kick her out without her consent. Unless there's some sort of lease or agreement where she's a tenant, but the post doesn't mention that. If she's living there as a tenant, he can end the lease with proper notice. But if she's just living there as a family member, he might not have that right. So legally, he might be in a tricky spot.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions that he tried to build a relationship with her but she was indifferent. He bought her a car, she didn't acknowledge him. Now he's been patient, but she's stayed past 18 when he expected her to move out. He's frustrated and wants her to leave. But does he have the right to do that? His fianc\u00e9's mom is okay with her staying, so maybe there's pressure from the fianc\u00e9's side. The author is in a committed relationship but not married, so maybe the arrangement isn't as clear as if they were married. \n\nThe stepdaughter is working and saving money. She might be saving up to move out on her own, but hasn't yet. The author wants to force her to move out. Is it fair to do that? The author doesn't seem to care how she reacts, which might be harsh. But he also wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he can't legally remove an adult from the house unless there's a lease. Also, ethically, pushing her out without her consent could be seen as unfair, especially if she's saving to move out on her own. But maybe the author's perspective is valid because he's been patient and she hasn't moved out. However, the key point is whether he has the legal authority to do it. Since the post is about being in the wrong morally, maybe the answer is A because he's not in a position to force her out without her agreement, and doing so could be seen as wrong.\n"
