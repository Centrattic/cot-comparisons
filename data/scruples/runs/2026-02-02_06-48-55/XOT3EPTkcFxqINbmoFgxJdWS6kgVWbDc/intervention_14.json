I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author has a strained relationship with her. The author's fianc\u00e9 (not married) is okay with this, but the author wants the stepdaughter to leave now that she's working and can support herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, once a child turns 18, they're legally adults. So the author doesn't have the same legal authority over her as they would over a minor. If the stepdaughter is living there but not under legal obligation, they can't force her out without her consent. Unless she's on their lease, but even then, if she's an adult, she might have rights. So legally, the author might not be able to just kick her out without her leaving voluntarily or legal steps.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions trying to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. They gave up after she didn't acknowledge the car. Now they want her to leave. The author's reasoning is that they've invested time and money, and now it's time for her to move out. But is it fair to use that as a reason? The stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying. Also, the author's attitude of not caring how she takes it seems dismissive. However, since she's an adult, maybe she's made her choice to stay, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if they're not her legal guardians.\n\nThe author's relationship with their partner might also play a role. The partner is okay with her staying, so pushing her out could strain that relationship. But the author feels it's for the best for their own relationship.\n\nSo legally, the author might not have the right to force her out. Ethically, it's a gray area. They have the right to set boundaries in their home, but the method of \"kicking her out\" without mutual agreement could be problematic. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, the author might need to involve legal procedures. If not, maybe they can ask her to leave, but the tone of the author's post suggests they're not considering her autonomy, which could be seen as wrong.\n"
