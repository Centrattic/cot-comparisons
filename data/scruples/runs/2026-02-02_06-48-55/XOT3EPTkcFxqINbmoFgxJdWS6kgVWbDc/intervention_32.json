I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9, not married, and they live together. The stepdaughter is an adult and lives with them.\n\nSo first, the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is 19, which is over the age of majority in most places (in the US, it's 18 in most states), she is legally an adult. That means the author doesn't have legal authority over her anymore. He can't just kick her out without a legal reason, like being a tenant or violating terms of her living arrangement. If she's a tenant, he might need to follow eviction procedures. If she's not on the lease, maybe he can ask her to leave, but that could still be complicated. But the question is more about moral or social wrong, not just legal.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The author mentions that the stepdaughter is indifferent and that he's been kind but not trying to build a relationship anymore. He bought her a car, but she didn't acknowledge him. That's hurtful, but the author gave up trying after that. Now he wants her to move out because he wants his house back for just him and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9, his partner, is okay with the stepdaughter staying. The author might be pressuring her to move out, which could affect the relationship between the author and his fianc\u00e9. Also, the stepdaughter is saving money, working, and has chosen to stay. She might feel forced out, which could be traumatic. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that he's given enough time, she's financially capable, and he wants his space back. He's not concerned about her negative reaction. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to ask an adult child to leave if they're financially independent? In some cases, people might see it as reasonable if the child is an adult and the parents feel they need space. However, the approach here seems pretty abrupt and not considering her feelings or her choice. The author is being blunt, not worrying about her reaction, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a committed relationship and might have the right to want privacy. However, the way he's handling it without considering consequences or her autonomy might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the stepdaughter's mother, who is his fianc\u00e9, might have a different view. If the author is pressuring her to move out against her will, it could create conflict in their relationship. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the stepdaughter's autonomy and is being dismissive of her feelings. Even though the stepdaughter is an adult, the way he's handling the situation could be seen as harsh. However, if the author is a landlord and she's a tenant, he's within his rights to ask her to leave, but the moral aspect is different. The question is whether he's in the wrong morally, not legally. \n\nIn summary, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's being dismissive and not considering the stepdaughter's feelings, and potentially creating conflict in his relationship with his fianc\u00e9. But I'm a bit torn because if the stepdaughter is an adult, the author's right to ask her to leave could be valid. But the approach is what's questionable here. So leaning towards A.\n"
