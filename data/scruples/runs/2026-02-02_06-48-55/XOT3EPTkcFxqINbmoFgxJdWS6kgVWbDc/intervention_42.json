I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an adult stepdaughter living with her stepfather and mother, and the stepfather wants to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult, she's not a minor anymore. Legally, she can't be forced to leave unless there's a lease issue or something. If she's on the lease or the tenant, the stepfather might need her to move out through proper channels like a lease agreement or evicting if necessary. But if she's just living there without a formal agreement, maybe he can ask her to leave. However, if she's been living there for a while under certain conditions, there might be legal implications for sudden eviction.\n\nThen there's the emotional and familial aspect. The stepfather has tried to build a relationship but felt rebuffed. The stepdaughter isn't moving out despite having a job and saving money. He wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e. But is that his right? The mother (his fianc\u00e9e) supports her daughter living there, which complicates things. The stepfather's approach seems harsh\u2014saying he doesn't care how she takes it. That's not exactly supportive or kind, but maybe he's had enough.\n\nAnother angle: the stepfather has been supporting her financially (like buying the car). If he's been providing financial support, maybe there's an expectation of her to move out. However, since she's an adult, she has the right to choose where to live. Forcing her out without her consent could be seen as overstepping, even if he's the one paying the bills.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's role is also important. If he goes ahead without discussing properly, it might strain their relationship. The mother might not be on board with the eviction, leading to conflict. The author's intention is to push her out for the house but is this the right way? Maybe there's a more amicable solution, like setting boundaries or having a heart-to-heart about expectations.\n\nIn terms of morality, is it wrong to ask an adult child to leave if they're not contributing or planning to? It's a gray area. On one hand, he's entitled to his living space. On the other hand, family dynamics can be complex. But the stepfather's approach is blunt and dismissive of her feelings, which might not be the best way to handle it.\n\nPutting it all together: Legally, he might be able to ask her to leave if it's his house and she's not on the lease. However, morally and ethically, it's questionable if there's no prior agreement about her staying. The stepfather's decision to kick her out without considering her situation or negotiating could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that he's not concerned about her reaction shows a lack of empathy, which might make him the wrongdoer in the situation.\n"
