I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is whether kicking out an adult stepdaughter is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, not married. They live together, and her adult daughter, 19 years old, lives with them. The stepdaughter and the author have a strained relationship. The stepdaughter isn't going to college, works at a salon, and the author wants her to leave so the house is just for him and his fianc\u00e9e. The stepdaughter has the means to move out but chooses to stay. The author is considering kicking her out.\n\nNow, the key points here: The stepdaughter is an adult, 19 years old. Legally, in most places, once someone is 18 or 19, they are adults and can make their own decisions. However, if she's still living in the home and the author is paying for her living expenses, that's different. But if she's working and contributing, maybe she's staying by choice.\n\nThe author mentions he gave up trying to build a relationship after she didn't thank him for buying her a car. He's waiting her out. Now he wants to push her out. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her living there, but the author wants her to leave.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the stepdaughter is an adult. If she's choosing to stay, perhaps the author doesn't have the legal right to kick her out unless she's a tenant or under some agreement. If she's just a family member, he might not have that right. However, if the author is the homeowner and the stepdaughter isn't paying rent, he might have the legal standing. But ethically, it's more complicated.\n\nThe author's motivation is wanting the house for himself and his fianc\u00e9e. But the stepdaughter has the means to move out. The author's approach is to push her out without considering her feelings. Even if he's not wrong legally, ethically, it's harsh. He might be right in wanting her to be independent, but the method of kicking her out could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut since she's an adult, maybe it's her responsibility to leave. However, if she's still living there by choice, forcing her out could be seen as wrong. The author's decision might be justified if they have a legal right, but if it's a family matter without legal tenant rights, it's still a sensitive situation. The key is whether he's violating any agreements or her rights as an adult. If she's not a tenant and just a family member, he might have the right, but it's a personal choice for her to stay. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being harsh and not considering her autonomy. Or maybe not, because he's trying to set boundaries.\n\nHmm. I think the answer depends on legal tenant rights and ethical considerations. If the stepdaughter is a tenant, he might need to follow eviction processes. If not, he might have the right. But ethically, it's a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she's an adult who can choose to leave, but he's choosing to make her leave. So the answer could be B (No), but some might say A (Yes) because of the lack of consideration for her feelings.\n"
