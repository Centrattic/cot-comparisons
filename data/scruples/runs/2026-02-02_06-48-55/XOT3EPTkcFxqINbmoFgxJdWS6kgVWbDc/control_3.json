I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The stepdaughter is an adult, so legally, she's an adult. The author isn't her parent, as the mother is the one who is married to the author (though they're not technically married, but living together). The author has tried to build a relationship but hasn't succeeded. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out as expected, and the author is frustrated. \n\nNow, the key points here are the age of the stepdaughter and the legal responsibilities. Since she's 19, she's an adult, and the author isn't her legal guardian. The mother is her legal parent, and the author's fianc\u00e9e is the one who might have a say, but the author is the one wanting to kick her out. \n\nLegally, the author doesn't have the authority to make the stepdaughter leave unless there's a lease agreement that specifies this. If the stepdaughter is on the lease or is a tenant, the author can't just kick her out without legal process. However, if she's a guest or not on the lease, the situation might be different. The post doesn't clarify this, but it's a crucial point.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels that their efforts were ignored, like buying the car and not being acknowledged. The stepdaughter's behavior might have contributed to the author's frustration. However, the author's approach is to just push her out without considering her feelings or circumstances. \n\nThe stepdaughter is working and saving money, so she might be trying to save up to move out on her own. The author is taking matters into their own hands, which could be seen as harsh, especially if she's still in the process of saving. The mother is in favor of keeping her, which complicates things because the author's fianc\u00e9e might be complicit in allowing her to stay.\n\nThere's also the aspect of respect and boundaries. The author gave up trying to connect after being disregarded, which is understandable, but using that as a reason to kick her out might not be fair. The stepdaughter might not have control over the situation as much as the author thinks.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's motivation is to have privacy with their partner. That's valid, but the method of handling it is questionable. Legally, they might not have the right, and ethically, forcing someone out without considering their autonomy could be wrong. The stepdaughter is an adult with her own choices, and the author's frustration doesn't justify overstepping.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions could be legally problematic if they don't have the authority to remove the stepdaughter. Even if they could, the approach is abrupt and might not respect her autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
