I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of the house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the adult in question is 19 years old. The stepdad is in a long-term relationship with the mother, but they aren't married. The stepdad has tried to build a relationship with the daughter but it didn't work out. The daughter is financially independent now, working and saving money. The stepdad wants her to leave because he wants the house to be just for him and his partner.\n\nSo, the key points here are the daughter's age, her independence, and the stepdad's intentions. Legally, once someone is 18, they're an adult and the parents (or stepparents) have fewer legal obligations. However, in a non-legal, social context, there's the aspect of family dynamics. The stepdad isn't her biological parent, so the responsibility might not be as clear as a traditional parent-child relationship. \n\nThe stepdad bought her a car, which was unacknowledged. That seems like a hurtful incident, maybe contributing to his decision. But he's been trying for years to improve the relationship without success. Now that she's working and saving, he's pushing for her to leave. The mother seems to be supportive of the daughter staying, which could create tension.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the daughter has the legal right to stay if she's an adult, unless there's some agreement or legal guardianship in place. But since the stepdad isn't her legal guardian, he can't force her out without her consent. However, the house is shared with his partner, and they might be the ones financially supporting her stay. If the daughter isn't contributing to the household or is causing conflict, the housemates might have a right to expect her to leave eventually, especially if she's not a family member by blood.\n\nBut there's also the question of ethics. Even if he's not her parent, he's been acting as a caregiver for years. Cutting off support suddenly might be harsh. However, if the relationship was strained and the daughter chose to stay, maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries now that she's independent.\n\nThe stepdad is not in a legal position to force her out unless there's an agreement. If he's the one providing housing, he can ask her to leave, but he should consider her rights and the existing relationship. If she's an adult, she can choose to stay or leave, but if the house is his and he wants to ask her to leave, he has the right to do so unless there's a lease or legal obligation. However, if the mother is the one providing financial support, maybe the stepdad isn't the one who should be making that decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the stepdad's actions might be legally justified if he owns the house and she's a tenant. But ethically, it's a gray area. The daughter is an adult, so the stepdad isn't in the wrong for wanting her to leave if they've reached an impasse. However, the way he's approaching it (not caring about her reaction) might be seen as harsh. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not her legal parent and she's an adult, he's not in the wrong for setting boundaries once she's independent. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
