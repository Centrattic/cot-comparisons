I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter who's 19. The stepdaughter lives with her mom, who is the author's fianc\u00e9e, and they're in an 8-year relationship but not married.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult. Legally, the author doesn't have parental rights unless they've adopted her, which the question doesn't mention. So, the author can't just kick an adult out of their house unless there's a lease issue or some legal agreement. The stepdaughter is an adult, so she's free to leave whenever she wants, but the author might be trying to push for that.\n\nThen, the relationship aspect. The author mentions that the relationship with the stepdaughter is strained. The stepdaughter hasn't acknowledged the author's gifts and is indifferent. The author has tried hard but feels it's time for her to move out since she's 18 and working now. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her staying, which complicates things because the author's partner might be unhappy if he pushes this.\n\nEthically, is it right for the author to kick her out? Since the author isn't her parent, the responsibility isn't on them to make her leave. The mother (fianc\u00e9e) is the one who might have some influence. The author could talk to the mother to encourage the stepdaughter to move out, but taking unilateral action might not be fair. Also, the stepdaughter is choosing to stay, and while she's an adult, maybe she has reasons for staying that the author isn't considering. For example, maybe she's saving money for school or other purposes, or there are other family dynamics at play.\n\nThe author's motivation is wanting the house to be just for them and their partner, which is understandable. However, the stepdaughter has a right to choose where she lives until she moves out on her own. If the author tries to force her out, it could lead to conflict and legal issues if there's no legal standing. The author might need to have a conversation with the mother to see if they can both encourage the stepdaughter to move out, but the author acting alone might be overstepping, especially if they don't have a formal agreement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they don't have the legal authority to remove an adult from the house, and ethically, they should work with the mother rather than unilaterally deciding. Also, the stepdaughter is an adult and has her own life choices. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach might be problematic.\n"
