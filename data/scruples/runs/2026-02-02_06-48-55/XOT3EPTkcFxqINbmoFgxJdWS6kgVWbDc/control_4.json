I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario involves an 8-year relationship where the stepdaughter is 19, living with them. The stepdaughter's mother is the author's fianc\u00e9e, and they aren't married but live together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult, the legal responsibility might not rest with the author. In many places, once someone is 18 or 19, they're legally adults, and the parent (in this case, the fianc\u00e9e) might still have some obligations if the stepdaughter is their child. However, if the stepdaughter is living independently, even if with family, the author might not have a legal obligation to provide her housing.\n\nNext, the emotional and relational dynamics. The author mentions that the relationship with the stepdaughter has been difficult, with the stepdaughter being indifferent. The author tried to build a relationship but gave up after a negative reaction to a gift. Now, they want her to move out to have privacy with their partner. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her living there, which could complicate things because the author's partner might not support the eviction.\n\nEthically, the author's decision hinges on whether they're the one responsible for the stepdaughter's housing. If the stepdaughter is financially independent and the author is not her parent, the author might have a right to ask. However, the stepdaughter might feel entitled to stay, especially if she's staying with her mother. The author's motivation is about personal space, which is valid, but the stepdaughter's choice to stay could be about her relationship with her mother.\n\nPotential issues: The author might be making a unilateral decision that affects the stepdaughter's living situation without considering her needs. Even though the author isn't her parent, their partner is the mother, so there could be emotional ties the author isn't considering. Also, the author's approach of not caring about her reaction could lead to conflict or resentment. The fianc\u00e9e's possible upset adds another layer, as the author's action might strain their relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the stepdaughter is capable of moving out but chooses not to, the author might have a right to request it. However, the method and communication matter. Abruptly kicking someone out without support might be harsh. The author should consider discussing it with the stepdaughter directly, not just the fianc\u00e9e, to understand her situation better.\n\nLegal perspective: The author might not be in the wrong legally, as the stepdaughter is an adult. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author's responsibility as a non-parent is less clear. If the stepdaughter is staying with her mother, the mother's decision to let her stay could mean the author has no authority. However, if the author is the one covering housing costs, that's a different scenario.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong legally but could be ethically if they're not considering the stepdaughter's circumstances or the dynamics with their partner. The key points are the adult status of the stepdaughter, the author's role in her housing, and the approach taken to address the situation.\n"
