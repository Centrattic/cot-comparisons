I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong by considering kicking out his adult stepdaughter. First, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult, legally, she's an adult, so the author doesn't technically need to give her notice or anything. But there's more to it.\n\nThe author mentions that they're in a long-term relationship, not married, and they've been living together for 8 years. The stepdaughter was bought a car at 16, which he felt was unacknowledged. He's frustrated that she's not moving out. The stepmother supports her living there. The author wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nEmotionally, the author has tried to build a relationship but felt ignored. Now he's ready to push her out. Legally, he can do this since she's an adult, but ethically? There's a duty of care if she's still relying on them. If she's working and saving, maybe she can move out, but is it fair to kick her out? Maybe she's saving up, but perhaps she's not ready yet.\n\nThe author's motivation is wanting the house for himself and his partner. That's understandable, but does that justify forcing her out? There's a lack of communication mentioned. He asked the stepmother, but maybe he should talk directly to the stepdaughter. Also, the mother's support could be a factor. If the mother is okay with it, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's a conflict of interest.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe setting boundaries, giving her a timeline to leave, or helping her transition. But the author says he doesn't care about her reaction, which is harsh. The stepdaughter might feel betrayed. So, while legally he's in the right, ethically, it's questionable. He's not her parent anymore since she's an adult, but they've been providing support. Is it right to just kick her out? Maybe, but the approach lacks empathy. However, the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate. The answer might be A or B depending on perspective. But the key is that since she's an adult, he has the right, but the ethical side is tricky. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" If he's within his legal rights, then maybe not in the wrong, but ethically questionable. Since the options are A or B, and the user thinks A (he's wrong), but maybe the answer is B (not wrong) because he's within his rights.\n"
