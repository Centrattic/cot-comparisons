I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong when considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, not married. They have a 19-year-old stepdaughter who lives with them. The stepdaughter's mom is also part of the house. The stepdaughter isn't in school anymore and works at a salon. The author bought her a car for her 16th birthday, but the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge them, only the mother. The author gave up trying to build a relationship and now wants her to leave because they want their home back with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author is not.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the stepdaughter is an adult, has her own job, and is financially independent enough to move out. The author is not her parent, since the mother is the one who is married to the author. The author is trying to push her out because they want their space back. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't the parent, so they can't force her to leave unless there's some sort of lease agreement or legal obligation. But since she's an adult, she can choose to stay or leave. The author doesn't own the home alone; it's their home with their fianc\u00e9, but the stepdaughter is an adult, so unless there's a written agreement, the author might not have the legal right to kick her out if she doesn't want to leave. But that's a legal aspect, which the user might not be asking about.\n\nEthically, it's a different question. The author is trying to create boundaries, which is understandable. They've tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. The stepdaughter isn't forced to stay; she could move out. However, the author is considering pushing her out, which could be seen as harsh, especially if the stepdaughter is not causing issues. The author mentions not caring about how she reacts, which might come off as dismissive. The fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, so the author might be acting against their partner's wishes.\n\nBut the stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the right to make her own choices. The author might feel they've done their part, but the stepdaughter is choosing to stay. The author's frustration is valid, but forcing someone out could be seen as wrong if it's not a matter of safety or legal rights. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have the same responsibility as a parent would. However, the author might have contributed financially to her well-being, so there's an expectation that she would move out. But since she's an adult, that expectation isn't enforceable.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't legally in the wrong because they aren't her parent, but ethically, if the stepdaughter isn't causing problems, the author might be overstepping by forcing her out. The stepdaughter has her own autonomy. The author's actions could be seen as wrong if they're not respecting her choices as an adult. Alternatively, the author is trying to set boundaries for their own household, which could be justified.\n\nI think the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they're trying to remove an adult who isn't causing harm, and the stepdaughter's decision to stay is her own. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have the authority to kick her out without mutual agreement. But maybe the answer is B if the author is justified in wanting their space back. Hmm, this is tricky. The key is that the author is not the parent, so they can't force the stepdaughter to leave if she doesn't want to. The author might be in the wrong because they're not the one with legal authority over her living situation. So answer A.\n"
