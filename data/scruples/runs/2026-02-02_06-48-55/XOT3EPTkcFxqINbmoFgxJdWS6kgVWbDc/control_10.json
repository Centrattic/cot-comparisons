I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the stepdaughter is 19, living with them, and hasn't moved out despite being able to. The author's fianc\u00e9 is technically his stepmother, but they're not married. The stepdaughter works and has money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The stepdaughter is an adult, so the author doesn't have legal authority over her. In most places, once someone is an adult, they can't be forced out unless there's a lease or legal agreement. If she's on the lease, he can't just kick her out without going through proper legal channels. But if she's on her mother's lease, maybe the mother would have to deal with it. However, the author isn't married to his fianc\u00e9, so maybe she's not on the lease? Not sure, but legal rights matter here.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author tried to build a relationship but failed. The stepdaughter isn't responsive, which is frustrating. But using a public forum (like WIBTA) to decide to kick someone out can be seen as harsh, especially if it's sudden. The stepdaughter might have a right to privacy and stability. Also, the fianc\u00e9 might be involved in the lease, so her input is important. The author is planning to proceed without considering her feelings too much, which could strain the relationship.\n\nSocial norms also play a role. It's common for young adults to live with family while establishing themselves, but it's also expected that they eventually move out. However, the author's approach might be abrupt and hurtful. The stepdaughter might not be ready, or maybe there are underlying issues she hasn't shared. The author is dismissing her feelings, which isn't ideal.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, maybe not if he can follow proper procedures. But ethically, being considerate is important. The author isn't giving her a chance to move out gracefully or address the situation with empathy. Publicly seeking validation might not be the best approach either. The answer likely leans towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of consideration for her feelings and the potential legal issues if he doesn't follow proper steps. But I need to confirm the legal part. If he can legally kick her out without being on the lease, maybe not. But generally, you can't just kick someone out without legal process. So maybe the answer is A because he's being inconsiderate and possibly not following proper procedures.\n"
