I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter lives with them, is 19, works, and has the means to move out. The author is frustrated because they've tried building a relationship, which didn't work, and they want the house to themselves.\n\nFirst, legally, the stepdaughter is an adult. Once someone is 18, they're legally an adult, so the author can't force her to leave unless there's some legal guardianship or financial dependency. But in this case, the stepdaughter is working and saving, so maybe she's not dependent. However, if she's living there for free, maybe the author is providing a home. But the author isn't her parent, just a step-parent. So legally, the author might not have the right to kick her out unless there's a lease issue or something else.\n\nEthically, the author is being harsh. They mention they tried to build a relationship but were ignored. Now they want to push her out. The stepdaughter might feel it's unfair, especially if she's contributing (working, saving) and the author is using the house as a reason. The author is also being dismissive of the stepdaughter's feelings and possibly the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 might have a different view since she loves having her daughter there. The author's approach could be seen as selfish, prioritizing their own needs without considering others' perspectives.\n\nBut the stepdaughter is an adult, so if she wants to stay, maybe she can. However, the author is in a committed relationship and wants the house for two people. The question is whether the author has the right to set boundaries. If the stepdaughter is living in the home without contributing or if there's a lease that's ending, the author might have a case. But if it's a long-term arrangement and the stepdaughter is just there by choice, the author might not have the right to kick her out unilaterally.\n\nAlso, the author's tone is pretty dismissive. They don't care how the stepdaughter takes it, which is harsh. Even if they're in a position to set boundaries, the way they're handling it is problematic. They might need to have a conversation with the stepdaughter and the fianc\u00e9 to agree on terms, maybe setting a timeline for her to move out if she's not contributing financially or otherwise.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're acting unilaterally without considering the stepdaughter's autonomy and possibly the fianc\u00e9's wishes. They're also being emotionally dismissive. However, if the stepdaughter isn't contributing and it's affecting the household dynamics, there's a case for the author wanting to set boundaries. But the way they're approaching it is where the issue lies. They should be more collaborative. So maybe the author is in the wrong because of the approach, not necessarily the desire to have the house to themselves.\n"
