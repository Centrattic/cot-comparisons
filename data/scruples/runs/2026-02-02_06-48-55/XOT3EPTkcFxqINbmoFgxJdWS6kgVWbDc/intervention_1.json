I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The author is in a long-term relationship, not married, but living as married. They proposed with the understanding they wouldn't get married. The stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author feels they've given her enough support. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out as the author expected, and now the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's legally an adult, so the author can't just kick her out without her agreeing or some legal process. But the user isn't asking about legality, they're asking if the author is morally or ethically wrong. \n\nEthically, the author might be in the wrong if there's no mutual agreement. The stepdaughter is choosing to stay and work, and the author's fianc\u00e9e supports her staying. The author has been trying to build a relationship but the stepdaughter has been indifferent. However, the author has a right to their own space. But is it fair to push her out if she's not causing problems? Maybe the author needs to communicate better with both the stepdaughter and the fianc\u00e9e. The author's approach seems a bit harsh, especially since the stepdaughter hasn't done anything wrong to warrant being kicked out. The author might be prioritizing their own wants over the stepdaughter's needs. Also, the author's indifference after the car incident shows a breakdown in communication, but that's in the past. Now, maybe the author should have a conversation with the stepdaughter instead of just deciding to kick her out. So the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the situation more collaboratively.\n"
