I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a stepfather who wants to kick out his adult stepdaughter. She's 19, works, and the author feels he's supported her for too long. The stepdaughter hasn't been close to him, and the author is frustrated. The mother is in a long-term relationship with the author, but they aren't married. The stepdaughter is living at home, and the author wants her to move out.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: in most places, once someone is 18, they're an adult. Legally, the author doesn't have the authority to force her out unless there's a lease issue. But since she's an adult and living at home, maybe she's not on the lease. But the author could ask her to leave, but that might be seen as harsh.\n\nEthically, even if she's an adult, she might be in a position where moving out isn't feasible right away. She's 19, working part-time, maybe saving money. The author has been supporting her, but she hasn't been close. The author might feel it's time for her independence, but is it fair to kick her out without giving her proper time or support?\n\nThe stepdaughter hasn't been hostile, just indifferent. The author isn't concerned about her reaction, which might indicate a lack of empathy. The mother supports her daughter living there, so the author is going against her wishes. That could cause family conflict.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is about wanting the house to himself and his partner. But the stepdaughter is an adult, and the author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if she's not a legal responsibility, the ethical and emotional aspects matter. Forcing her out abruptly could be wrong, especially if she's not ready. The author might be in the wrong because he's not considering her situation enough and is acting out of personal frustration rather than her best interest.\n"
