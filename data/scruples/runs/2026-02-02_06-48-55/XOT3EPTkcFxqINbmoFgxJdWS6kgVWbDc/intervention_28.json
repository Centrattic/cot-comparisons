I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9e, not married, but living as a married couple. The fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter, 19 years old, living with them. The author wants to kick the stepdaughter out because they have a bad relationship and the stepdaughter hasn't moved out yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult. Legally, the author doesn't have the authority to force her to leave unless there's some sort of legal guardianship or lease agreement that the author is part of. But since they're not married, the author probably isn't legally responsible for the stepdaughter. The mother, being her legal parent, would have more legal standing here. So if the stepdaughter doesn't want to leave, the author can't just kick her out without her mother's agreement. That could lead to legal issues, like eviction processes or even harassment charges if done improperly.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions they tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but it didn't work. They gave up after the car incident. Now they want her to leave because they want the house to themselves. The mother is okay with the daughter staying, which might mean the author is overstepping by trying to push her out without the mother's consent. The author's fianc\u00e9e is also part of this situation, and the author is expecting her to go along with this, which could cause conflict in their relationship. The mother might feel that the author is being unfair to her daughter, especially if the daughter is saving money and working but the author is pressuring her to leave.\n\nAnother angle is the stepdaughter's own autonomy. At 19, she's an adult and should be making her own decisions. The author's desire to have the house to themselves doesn't give them the right to dictate her living situation. The author's approach seems harsh and dismissive of the stepdaughter's feelings and choices. Even if the stepdaughter has a strained relationship with the author, that doesn't justify forcing her out. The author should have discussed this with the mother and the daughter to find a mutual solution, rather than deciding unilaterally.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude of not caring how she reacts is concerning. It shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and potential consequences. This could lead to a hostile environment or even legal action if the stepdaughter feels wronged. The author's main motivation is their own desire for privacy and space, which is understandable, but it's not a valid reason to infringe on someone else's living arrangements without their consent.\n\nIn summary, the author is likely in the wrong because they're attempting to control the living situation of an adult who isn't under their legal responsibility, without considering the mother's wishes or the daughter's autonomy. The legal and ethical implications suggest that the author's actions are inappropriate and could lead to further problems.\n"
