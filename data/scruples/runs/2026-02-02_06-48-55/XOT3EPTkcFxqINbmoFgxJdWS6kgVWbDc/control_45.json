I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the stepdaughter, who is 19, lives with them. The author's partner (his fianc\u00e9) is okay with her staying, but the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The stepdaughter is an adult over 18, so legally, she's an adult. In most places, parents don't have the legal authority to force an adult child to leave unless there's a lease agreement. If the author is the landlord and she's a tenant, he might have more sway. But if she's just staying in the house as a guest, he might not. The author mentions she works and has money, so she can afford to move out.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author feels they've tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The key event was buying her a car for her 16th birthday, which she didn't acknowledge. The author gives up trying and is now considering pushing her out. The author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, which complicates things because the author's partner might not support this action.\n\nThe author's main motivation is wanting the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9. But the stepdaughter has a choice to make here too. Since she's an adult, it's not necessarily the author's decision. However, if the author is also a co-parent or has some legal responsibility, that might change things. The scenario says the author isn't her parent; he's the stepfather, and they aren't married. So legally, he might not have any obligation towards her. Ethically, though, he might be expected to support his partner's child, especially if she's still in her late teens and not in school. But she's working and saving money, which suggests she's capable of being independent.\n\nThe author's approach is to push her out, which could be seen as harsh. However, since she's an adult, he's not wrong to set boundaries. The problem is that he's not considering her autonomy. She might have reasons for staying, and being forced out could have negative consequences. The author's lack of concern for her reaction might be inconsiderate, but he's justified in wanting to have his own space. It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, he's not in the wrong, but ethically, it's questionable because he's choosing his own comfort over her living situation. But since she's an adult, maybe he's not obligated to support her anymore. So the answer might be B (No), but with some nuances.\n"
