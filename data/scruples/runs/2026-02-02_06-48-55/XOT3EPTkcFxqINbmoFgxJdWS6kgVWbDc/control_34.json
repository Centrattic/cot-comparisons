I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 and lives with the author and their partner. The author proposed a fake engagement to their partner, who had a messy divorce and doesn't want to remarry. The stepdaughter's mother is the author's fianc\u00e9e. The author has tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but was ignored, even after a generous gift (a car). They expected her to leave when she turned 18, but she stayed. Now, the author wants her to move out because they want their house back for just them and their partner.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the stepdaughter is an adult, she's not a minor, and she's choosing to live at home. The author is considering asking her to leave. Legally, once someone is 18, they can make their own decisions, including where to live. However, since the author isn't her parent (she's the stepdaughter of the author's partner), the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless she's a tenant. If she's living there as a tenant, they can follow eviction processes. But if she's a guest or family member, it's more complicated.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated after years of trying to build a relationship and feeling that their partner is more attached to the daughter than they are. The author's frustration is valid, but they need to consider the stepdaughter's autonomy. The stepdaughter might be saving money, working, and choosing to stay for her own reasons. The author's approach of not caring how she reacts could be seen as dismissive. However, since she's an adult, she's responsible for her own decisions. The author isn't legally wrong, but emotionally, forcing someone out might not be fair if there's no malicious intent. The author's motives are about wanting their space back, which is understandable, but they should handle it respectfully, perhaps by having a conversation with the stepdaughter directly, rather than just pushing her out. The partner's feelings are also a factor, but the main issue is respecting the adult daughter's choice to live where she wants. So, the author isn't in the wrong legally or ethically if they proceed with proper communication and legal processes, but they might need to approach it more sensitively.\n"
