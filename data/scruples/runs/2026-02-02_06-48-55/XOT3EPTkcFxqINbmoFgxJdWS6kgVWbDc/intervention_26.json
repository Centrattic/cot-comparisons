I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, who has an 19-year-old daughter. They live together, and the author has tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but feels it's one-sided. The daughter chose to stay at home instead of going to school or moving out, and the author wants her to leave. He's considering kicking her out.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. In most places, once someone is 18, they're an adult, so the author doesn't have legal authority to force them out. But she's living with her mother, who is the author's fianc\u00e9e. The mother hasn't asked the daughter to leave, so maybe there's a living arrangement that's mutual. The author might not have the legal right to evict someone else's adult child without consent.\n\nEthically, even if the relationship is strained, the author is not her parent. He's in a relationship with her mother, so the mother's wishes matter. The mother seems happy having her daughter there. The author is essentially trying to control someone else's adult child's life, which might be overstepping. He's also not considering the daughter's autonomy. She's 19, can choose where to live. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of \"kicking her out\" without discussing it with the mother or the daughter is problematic. He should communicate with both and maybe set boundaries rather than unilaterally deciding.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of not caring how she reacts might be dismissive. Even if the relationship isn't ideal, treating someone with respect is important. The mother's support for her daughter's choice complicates things. The author might need to have a conversation with his fianc\u00e9e to find a compromise, maybe set a timeline for the daughter to move out or find a different arrangement. But outright evicting without considering legal and ethical implications could be wrong.\n\nSo, the author is overstepping his role. He's not the parent, and the mother is making the decisions. His actions could be seen as disrespectful to both the daughter and his fianc\u00e9e. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
