I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's okay to kick out his adult stepdaughter. First, I need to consider the legal aspects. The stepdaughter is 19 and lives in the US, probably. In most states, once a person is an adult, they can be asked to leave if they're not a legal ward. Since she's 19, she's an adult, so legally, the author might have the right to ask her to leave, especially if she's not his biological child and there's no legal obligation to support her.\n\nNow, the emotional side. The author mentions that the stepdaughter and he have a strained relationship. He tried to be kind but eventually gave up. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge his gift, which might have hurt him. The mother (his fianc\u00e9) doesn't want the daughter to leave, which complicates things. The author wants the house to be just for him and his partner now. \n\nBut wait, even though legally he can ask her to leave, there's a social and emotional part. The daughter might not have another place to go. If she's working and saving, maybe she's trying to move out on her own terms. Forcing her might be abrupt and not consider her needs. Also, the mother's feelings are important here. She might feel hurt if the author pushes her daughter out against her wishes. \n\nThe author says he doesn't care how she takes it, which seems pretty harsh. Even if there's a good reason, handling it without empathy could damage relationships. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting a deadline or discussing it with both the daughter and his fianc\u00e9. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, probably not. But morally, maybe. If he's using his authority to force her out without considering her situation or the mother's feelings, that's where he might be at fault. Also, not involving the mother in the decision could be a problem since she's the parent. He's taking a unilateral approach, which might not be fair. \n\nIn the end, while he has the legal right, the way he's handling it could be seen as wrong because of the lack of consideration for others' feelings and the abrupt nature of the action. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the ethical considerations despite legal rights.\n"
