I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author feels they've given enough support. The author is in a long-term relationship with the stepdaughter's mother, but they're not married.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author likely doesn't have legal control over her. They can't just kick her out without cause if she's an adult. So legally, the author might be in the wrong if they try to force her out without following proper procedures like a lease agreement or eviction process. But maybe they're the owner of the house, so they can set terms, but the stepdaughter might have a lease or be a tenant now.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions they gave up trying to build a relationship after the car incident. They've been kind but distant. The mother is okay with the daughter staying, so the author is pushing back against the mother's wishes. The author's main issue is wanting privacy with their partner. But is it fair to ask the daughter to leave? She's an adult, so she should be responsible for her own living situation. However, the author might have a right to their own home and privacy. But if the daughter is a tenant, the author can't just kick her out without notice or a valid reason. \n\nAlso, the author proposed to the mother, but they're not married, so maybe the mother expects support. But the daughter is 19, so she's expected to live on her own. The author's frustration is understandable, but they need to handle it through proper channels. Maybe they should communicate with the daughter and mother about moving out, rather than just deciding to kick her out. The author's approach of not caring about the daughter's reaction might be too harsh. They should consider the daughter's situation and give her time to find her own place.\n\nSo, legally, the author might not have the right to kick her out without following proper eviction procedures. Ethically, they should approach this with more empathy and communication rather than being blunt. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to kick her out without considering proper methods and the daughter's autonomy.\n"
