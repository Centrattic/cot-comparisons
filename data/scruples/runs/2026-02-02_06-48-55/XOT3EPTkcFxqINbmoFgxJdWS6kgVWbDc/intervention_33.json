I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with the author and their fianc\u00e9, and the author wants to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who isn't married but live as a married couple. The fianc\u00e9 has a 19-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. The author and the stepdaughter have a strained relationship. The author tried to bond but was met with indifference, even after giving her a car. Now, the author wants the stepdaughter to leave because they wanted the house to be just them and their fianc\u00e9. The stepdaughter is working but chooses to stay. The author is considering pushing her out, not caring how she reacts, and expects the fianc\u00e9 to be upset but hopes she'll see it's for the best.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult, the author might have the right to ask her to leave, especially if she's not a legal dependent. However, the ethical aspect is more complex. The author has a financial responsibility if they're providing for her. If the author is paying for her living expenses, they might be expected to help her transition out. But if the stepdaughter is working and contributing, that's different.\n\nEmotionally, the author's frustration is understandable, but the approach seems harsh. The author didn't try to communicate with the stepdaughter directly, only through the fianc\u00e9. The author might be avoiding conflict by not addressing the issue directly. Also, the lack of care for the stepdaughter's reaction could be seen as dismissive. The author's actions might strain the relationship with the fianc\u00e9, who supports the stepdaughter living there.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepdaughter is an adult and has the responsibility to move out if she can afford it. The author might feel they've given enough support, and it's time for her to be independent. But the author's approach is abrupt and not considering the stepdaughter's perspective. Maybe a more compassionate approach, setting a timeline for her to move out, or discussing it directly would be better.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, their approach could be improved. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they're the one providing the home, they have the right to ask her to leave, but their method might be harsh. The answer might be B (No) because they're not wrong, but others might argue A (Yes) due to the lack of empathy. I need to decide based on typical perspectives. Often, in such cases, people might say the adult child is responsible, but if the author is providing support, they might have a duty. Since the stepdaughter is working but choosing to stay, the author isn't wrong to want her to leave. So the answer is B.\n"
