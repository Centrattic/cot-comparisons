I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The author is in an 8-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who was previously divorced. The stepdaughter's mother is the fianc\u00e9, and the stepdaughter has been living with them since before she turned 18. The author tried to build a relationship with her but she was indifferent, even after they gave her a car for her 16th birthday. Now that she's 19, working, and has savings, the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the stepdaughter is considered a dependent. Since she's 19 and working, unless she's a student or has some other dependency, she's likely an adult. Legally, once someone is 18, they're an adult. The author isn't her legal parent, just a stepfather. The stepdaughter's mother is the one who has primary custody, and she's allowing her daughter to stay. The author's role here is more of a cohabiting partner, not a legal parent. So, the mother's decision to let her daughter stay is valid, but the author is considering making her leave, which might be a problem because they don't have the legal authority to do so.\n\nThe author mentions they aren't married, so they don't have the same legal rights or responsibilities as a step-parent through marriage. If the stepdaughter is not on the lease or mortgage, the author might have a case to ask her to leave. But if she is part of the lease, it's more complicated. Also, the mother's perspective is important. The author's fianc\u00e9 loves having her daughter there, so pushing her out without the mother's agreement could strain the relationship. The author's motivation is wanting the house to be just for them and the fianc\u00e9, but they need to respect the fianc\u00e9's wishes and the daughter's autonomy. The author's approach of being indifferent and waiting her out might have been harsh, but the current action of kicking her out is against the fianc\u00e9's desire and could be seen as overstepping, especially if they don't have legal standing. So, the answer might be A (author is wrong) because they don't have the legal right and they're disregarding the fianc\u00e9's wishes and the daughter's choice to stay.\n"
