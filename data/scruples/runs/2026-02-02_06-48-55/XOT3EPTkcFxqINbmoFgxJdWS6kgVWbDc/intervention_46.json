I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about wanting to kick out an adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship, not married, but living together. The stepdaughter is 19, works part-time, and has been living with them. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially after a gift. Now, they want her to move out because they want their house back for just them and their partner. The stepdaughter isn't planning to leave, and the author is considering pushing her out.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: The stepdaughter is an adult, so the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless she's a minor or there's some legal agreement. If she's an adult, she can choose to stay or leave. The author can't just kick her out without her consent or legal grounds. That might be an issue.\n\nEmotional aspect: The author feels they've put in effort to build a relationship but was met with indifference. They might be frustrated and want their space back. However, using force or pressure could damage relationships further. The stepdaughter might not have the means to move out immediately, even if she's working. She's only 19, so maybe she's saving up or needs more time.\n\nThe author's approach is blunt, saying they don't care how she takes it. That's harsh. Communication is key here. Instead of just kicking her out, discussing living arrangements and setting boundaries might be better. The partner (the author's fianc\u00e9) might be supportive, but it's also about respecting the stepdaughter's autonomy.\n\nAlso, considering cultural or family norms might play a role. In some contexts, family supports young adults until they're settled. The author might be acting out of selfishness, wanting their own space, but they need to balance that with the stepdaughter's situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author can't force her out. They need to have a conversation. Emotionally, the approach is dismissive and could be hurtful. The author is in a position where they need to respect the adult daughter's choices while setting boundaries. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick her out unilaterally without considering her autonomy and the legal/ethical implications.\n"
