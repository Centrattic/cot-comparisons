I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19, so she's an adult. Legally, she's an adult and not a minor, so she doesn't have the same rights as a child. The author isn't the legal parent, they're the stepfather. The mother is still the legal guardian, even though they live together. So if the author tries to kick her out, they might be overstepping their role. \n\nThe stepdaughter has been living at home since high school ended. She's working now, and the author is frustrated because she hasn't moved out. But the mother is okay with her staying. The author hasn't been involved much in her life, and the stepdaughter hasn't been close to them. \n\nLegally, the author doesn't have the authority to make her leave unless they have some sort of legal agreement or lease. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, they can't just kick her out without cause. The author is in a long-term relationship but not married, so the mother's decisions carry more weight legally. \n\nEmotionally, the author wants their privacy back with their partner. But the mother is supportive of the daughter staying. The author's approach might be seen as harsh, especially if the mother isn't on board. Also, the stepdaughter might not have a place to go, so it could be unfair to her. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they don't have legal authority to remove her, and the mother is allowing her to stay. Also, the stepdaughter is an adult who can choose to stay, and the author's actions could be seen as overstepping their role in her life.\n"
