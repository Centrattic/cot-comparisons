I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult. The author isn't her parent, just her stepfather. The key points here are about living arrangements and the author's feelings towards her. The author mentions they've tried to improve the relationship but it's been indifferent. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, and the author wants her to leave so that the house can be just for him and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she has the legal right to leave if she wants to, but the author might be her landlord if they own the house. If the stepdaughter is an adult, she's probably on a lease or renting from them. The author can't just kick her out without following proper legal procedures, like giving notice or going through an eviction process. So legally, the author might be in the wrong if they try to evict her without following the law.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The author feels like they've invested time and money (like buying the car). But since the stepdaughter is an adult, her living situation is her choice. The author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author wants her to leave. The author's frustration is understandable, but pushing for her to leave without consent could be seen as overstepping, especially if the stepdaughter isn't causing any harm. However, the author isn't her parent, so their authority is limited. \n\nSo the answer depends on both legal and ethical angles. Legally, the author needs to follow proper steps. Ethically, while the author's desire for space is valid, the stepdaughter's autonomy matters. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If they proceed without legal grounds, then yes. But if they handle it properly, maybe not. However, the initial intent to \"kick out\" without considering her rights might make them in the wrong.\n"
