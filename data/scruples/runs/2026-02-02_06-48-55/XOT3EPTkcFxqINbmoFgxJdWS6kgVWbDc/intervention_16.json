I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The author is in a long-term relationship, not married, with a fianc\u00e9e who has an adult daughter living with them. The stepdaughter isn't their biological child, so the author doesn't have a legal obligation to support her.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the stepdaughter is 18 or older, she's an adult, and the parents don't have legal authority over her. The author can ask her to leave since she's an adult. But there might be emotional and ethical considerations. The author mentions that the stepdaughter isn't particularly close with them, but the mother seems happy to have her stay. The author feels they've supported her enough and want the house back for themselves and their partner.\n\nEthically, the author's approach could be seen as harsh. The stepdaughter might be using the home as a base while she's establishing herself in the workforce. The author's lack of concern for her reaction might indicate a lack of empathy. However, since it's an adult daughter, the stepdaughter is responsible for her own decisions. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is also a factor; if she supports the stepdaughter's stay, the author's desire to push her out could create tension.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. If the author is providing a home without financial contribution from the stepdaughter, that's a valid reason to ask her to leave. But if the stepdaughter is contributing, maybe through chores or other means, that might balance things. The original story doesn't mention her contributing financially, so the author's position might be justified in that sense.\n\nHowever, the way the author is approaching it\u2014being blunt and not caring about her reaction\u2014could be seen as dismissive. Even though legally they can ask her to leave, the ethical side might require more consideration. The stepdaughter might be in a vulnerable position, especially if she's not financially stable yet. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach could be seen as harsh.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, their approach might be questionable. The key here is whether the author has a legal right to ask her out. Since she's an adult, they do. But the ethical side is more about the method and the underlying reasons. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the legal perspective, they might not be. However, the ethical side complicates things. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are seen as justified given the adult status of the stepdaughter.\n"
