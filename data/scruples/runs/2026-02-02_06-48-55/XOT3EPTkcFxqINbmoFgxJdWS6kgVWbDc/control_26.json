I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. They've been in a long-term relationship for 8 years, not married but living together. The stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author has tried to build a relationship but feels she's indifferent. The author gave her a car, which she only thanked the mother for, leading the author to give up. Now, the stepdaughter works and has money but hasn't moved out. The author wants her to leave, and the fianc\u00e9 might be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult (19), she's legally an adult, so the author doesn't have parental rights over her. The author might be a landlord if they own the home. So, if the stepdaughter is on a lease, they can't just kick her out without following legal procedures. If there's no lease, they might still need to provide proper notice. Legally, the author can't just evict her without following the law.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author tried to build a relationship but felt rejected. They wanted the stepdaughter to move out once she was an adult. However, they might have a responsibility to provide support if they've been taking care of her financially or otherwise. The stepdaughter might not be obligated to move out if she's paying rent or contributing to household expenses. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach of \"pushing her out\" without considering her needs or the legal steps might be wrong.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's role is also important. The author is in a relationship with the mother, so the daughter staying might be part of their living arrangement. The author's decision could affect the relationship with the fianc\u00e9, especially if the fianc\u00e9 supports the daughter's presence. However, the author's own feelings about wanting their own space are valid, but the method of handling it is questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author needs to follow proper procedures to remove an adult from their home. Morally, the author might have valid reasons for wanting to end the living arrangement, but the way they're approaching it (bluntly not caring about her reaction) could be seen as harsh. However, since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting her to leave, but they must do it correctly. The main issue is whether they're following the legal steps. If they're not, then they are in the wrong. Since the question is about being in the wrong in general, and without mentioning legal steps, the answer might be A (Yes) if they're not following the law. But if they're planning to do it legally, maybe B (No). But the question is phrased as \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong?\" given the scenario as presented. Since the author is considering just kicking her out without legal process, they are in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
