I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author wanting to kick out their stepdaughter, who's 19 and living with them. The author is in a long-term relationship with her mother, not married but living together. The stepdaughter never really bonded with the author, and the author tried to build a relationship but gave up after a car gift was ignored. Now the stepdaughter is 19, working, and not moving out, so the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the stepdaughter is an adult. At 18, she's an adult, so the author can't force her to stay. However, if she's living in their home, they might be providing support. The author's position is that they want their house back for just them and their partner. But the stepdaughter might be relying on this living situation, maybe for financial reasons or other support. \n\nEthically, the author's approach is a bit harsh. They mention not caring about her reaction and that they just want her out. The stepdaughter isn't a child anymore, so the author's role is more as a co-parent or partner's cohabitant. The stepdaughter's mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) supports her living there, so the author is going against the mother's wishes. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the way they're handling it\u2014being dismissive of the stepdaughter's feelings and the mother's support\u2014might be problematic. The stepdaughter might be saving up to move out on her own terms, and the author is pushing her to leave now, which could be seen as abrupt and not considering her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the dynamic here is that the author isn't the stepdaughter's parent. The mother is the one who might have the authority in such a decision. The author's role is more of a partner, so maybe they shouldn't be the one making the decision to kick her out without the mother's agreement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a position where they're trying to assert control over a living situation that involves an adult person. While the stepdaughter is an adult and can choose to stay, the author's desire to remove her without mutual agreement might not be the right approach. The author's disregard for her feelings and the mother's support could make them the one in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
