I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9e (not married), lives with her adult daughter who's 19. The stepdaughter has always been indifferent towards the author, and despite efforts to bond, there's no real connection. The author bought her a car, but she didn't acknowledge him. Now that she's working and could move out, the author wants her to leave because they want the house to themselves.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the rights and responsibilities of the author towards the stepdaughter. Since the stepdaughter is 19, an adult, she's not a minor. The author isn't her legal guardian anymore. Even if they live together, the author doesn't have the authority to force her out unless there's some sort of agreement or lease terms in place. The author's fianc\u00e9e might be the one who is her parent, so maybe the author isn't the one responsible financially or legally for the stepdaughter. \n\nThe author mentions that they've tried to be kind but are now giving up. They don't care how she takes it. But if the stepdaughter is paying rent or contributing in some way, maybe the author's reasoning is different. However, if she's living there for free, maybe the author can ask her to leave, but how that's done matters. If the author is the one who owns the house and the stepdaughter isn't a tenant, then the author might have the right to ask her to move out. But if the stepdaughter is on the lease or there's a shared living arrangement, it's more complicated. \n\nAlso, the author's motives are about wanting privacy and not being responsible for her anymore. But the stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, like financial stability. The author's approach seems abrupt and possibly disrespectful. Even though they have a poor relationship, handling this with more communication and possibly setting deadlines might be better. However, legally, if the author is the house owner and she's not a tenant, they might have the right to ask her to leave. \n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e's role is important here. If the fianc\u00e9e is the one who wants her daughter to stay, but the author is pushing to have her leave, that could strain their relationship. The author might be overstepping if they're making the decision without considering the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and the stepdaughter's situation. But legally, it's about the living arrangement. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong: If the author is acting within their rights (as the house owner) to ask an adult to leave, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they're being unfair or not giving her a chance to move out on her own terms, perhaps there's a moral issue. The author's motivation is for their own peace of mind, which is understandable, but the method could be problematic if it's too abrupt or disrespectful. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer depends on legal rights versus moral responsibility. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't legally responsible for her, so asking her to leave isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way it's being handled\u2014without considering communication or her situation\u2014could be seen as harsh. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong if they have the right to ask her to leave. But they might need to handle it more tactfully. But the question is if they are in the wrong, so if they have the right, then they aren't. So B.\n"
