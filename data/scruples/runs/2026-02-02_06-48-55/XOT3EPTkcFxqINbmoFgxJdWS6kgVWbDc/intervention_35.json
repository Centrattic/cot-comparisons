I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong when considering if they should kick their adult stepdaughter out. The scenario is that the person is in a long-term relationship (not married but live together) with their fianc\u00e9, who has an adult daughter living with them. The stepdaughter is 19, works, and the author feels they've given enough support and now wants her to move out. The author is considering kicking her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once someone turns 18, they are an adult and their parents can't legally force them to leave, but if they're not the legal guardian, the situation might differ. Here, the author is not the biological parent but the fianc\u00e9's partner. So if the fianc\u00e9 is the legal guardian, maybe the author doesn't have the legal authority to ask the stepdaughter to leave. However, since the stepdaughter is 19 and works, she's an adult, so the author might be able to set boundaries as the landlord or householder. But there might be nuances here.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author mentions trying to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The author gave up after a car incident where the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge them. Now they want her to move out. The author's main motivation is wanting the house to be just for the couple. The stepdaughter is choosing to stay, maybe because her mother wants her there. The author is not concerned about the stepdaughter's reaction, which could be seen as dismissive.\n\nIs it fair for the author to ask an adult daughter to leave? The stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the right to choose to live where she wants. The author could set clear boundaries, like if she's staying, she needs to contribute or follow house rules. But outright kicking her out without consent might be problematic. However, if the author is the one paying for the house and providing a place to live, they might have a right to expect certain behaviors or even to ask someone to leave if it's causing conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's relationship with their partner might be affected. The partner might be upholding the stepdaughter's decision to stay, causing tension. The author's approach of not caring how the stepdaughter takes it could lead to a hostile situation. There's a lack of communication between the author and the stepdaughter; maybe addressing the issues directly before making a decision would be better.\n\nSo, legally, if the author owns the house or is the main provider, they might have the right to ask her to leave. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author might be in the right if they're clear about boundaries and expectations, but if they're being abrupt and dismissive without considering the stepdaughter's autonomy, they might be in the wrong. The key is whether there was an agreement about her living there. If the stepdaughter is a tenant, proper notice might be required. If the author is the landlord and she's a tenant, they can't just kick her out without following legal procedures.\n\nIn conclusion, if the author didn't set clear expectations and is now acting unilaterally without considering the stepdaughter's right to her own space and choices, they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if they've provided notice and given her a chance to move out, it's different. The scenario here seems to lack that, so the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more respectfully.\n"
