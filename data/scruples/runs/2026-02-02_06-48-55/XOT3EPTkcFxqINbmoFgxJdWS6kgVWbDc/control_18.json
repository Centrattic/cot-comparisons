I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, who has an adult daughter who lives with them. The daughter is 19, has a job at a salon, and the author wants her to move out. The main issue is the strained relationship between the author and the stepdaughter, and the author's frustration with her staying past 18.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Since the daughter is 19, she's an adult. In most places, once someone is 18, they are legally adults and not considered minors anymore. That means the author, as a step-parent, doesn't have legal authority to make her leave. The mother (his fianc\u00e9e) might have a different role here, but the author isn't her parent. So legally, he can't just kick her out without her consent or some legal right to do so. If the daughter is on the lease, he can't remove her without her agreement or legal reasons.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author admits they have a poor relationship and that he's given up trying to improve it. He's frustrated because he wanted the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9e. But the daughter is an adult and has her own career and savings. The author's approach is to push her out, not considering her perspective. That could be seen as harsh, especially since she's choosing to stay and save money. The author is using his position in the relationship with the fianc\u00e9e to influence the situation, which might be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e supports the daughter staying, so the author is possibly ignoring her wishes. Even if he's in a committed relationship, decisions about living arrangements for an adult child are typically the parents' responsibility. Since the author isn't a parent, he's not in a position to make that decision. Also, the daughter might not be getting enough support for her decision to stay; maybe she's not ready to move out yet, or there are other factors (like financial stability, job, etc.) that the author isn't considering.\n\nThere's also the part where the author doesn't care how she takes it, which shows a lack of empathy. Communication is key in such situations. Instead of just deciding to kick her out, maybe a conversation where everyone's needs are discussed would be better. The author's approach seems abrupt and self-centered, focusing on his own desire for privacy and peace without considering the daughter's needs or the dynamics of their household.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he doesn't have legal authority to remove an adult from the home, he's being inconsiderate of the daughter's wishes and the fianc\u00e9e's support of her, and his approach is lacking in empathy and communication. The right thing would be to talk to the fianc\u00e9e and perhaps the daughter, find a compromise, or encourage the daughter to move out on her own terms rather than forcing it.\n"
