I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with her stepfather and stepmother. The stepfather wants her to move out because their relationship isn't good, and he's tired of waiting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The stepdaughter is 19, which is an adult. In most places, once someone is 18 or older, they're legally adults, and the house they live in isn't their parents' responsibility. So if she's not a minor, the stepfather doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's some specific agreement or situation. But since she's living there with her mother, maybe the mother is the one who's allowing her to stay. If the stepfather is just a cohabitant, he might not have the legal standing to kick her out unless he's a landlord or something, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The stepfather tried to build a relationship but it didn't work out. He gave her a car, but she didn't acknowledge him. Now he wants her to leave. He's in a committed relationship with his fianc\u00e9, who's okay with her staying. The stepmother might be the one who wants her to stay, so the stepfather is trying to push her out. Ethically, is it fair? Well, the daughter is an adult and has the right to choose where to live unless there's some dependency. If she's working and can support herself, she's not obligated to leave. But the stepfather is in a relationship and wants his privacy. There's a conflict here between their needs and hers.\n\nThe key points are: the daughter is an adult, they've been living together for years, she's working, and the stepfather is frustrated. The stepfather isn't her legal guardian anymore. So legally, he can't force her out. Ethically, it's more complex. He's entitled to his living space, but she's also entitled to her choice. If he tries to kick her out without her consent, that could be seen as unfair because she's not under his care anymore. However, since it's a shared home, if the other people in the household (the fianc\u00e9) don't want her to leave, there's a conflict in priorities.\n\nThe stepfather's approach seems harsh. He mentions not caring how she reacts and planning to push her out. That could be considered inconsiderate. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries or discussing it with the fianc\u00e9 first. But since the author is asking if he's in the wrong, considering legal rights, he might not be, but ethically, there's a gray area. However, the main issue is that he can't force her out unless there's a lease agreement or something else. Since he's not the landlord, and she's an adult, he doesn't have the authority. So in that case, he's in the wrong because he can't unilaterally decide to kick her out. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
