I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their stepdaughter. The author's situation is they live with their fianc\u00e9e and her adult daughter. The daughter is 19, works, and doesn't plan to move out. The author feels they've given enough support and want the house to themselves with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the daughter is an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so she's not a minor. This means the author doesn't have legal authority over her. The author mentions they bought her a car, which might be seen as financial support, but since she's an adult, that's a choice, not an obligation. The author's frustration is about wanting the house to themselves, but the stepdaughter isn't their child, so the author's right to evict her is questionable unless there's a lease agreement or something in place.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e is okay with her staying, which complicates things. The author might think it's their house, but if the fianc\u00e9e is the legal owner or they're on the lease together, the decision isn't entirely the author's. The author's approach of not caring about the daughter's reaction could be seen as harsh, especially since the daughter is choosing to live independently and may not have other stable housing.\n\nEthically, is it right to evict someone who's an adult? If the daughter is paying rent or contributing, maybe the author feels they're not pulling their weight. But if she's not paying, the author might be subsidizing her stay. However, the author's main argument is about wanting their own space, which is valid but needs to be handled respectfully. The author might be in the wrong if they don't consider alternatives, like setting boundaries or discussing moving out terms, rather than just kicking her out without a plan. Also, the daughter might not have a place to go, which raises concerns about her well-being.\n\nSo, considering legal rights, ethical responsibilities, and the daughter's situation, the author might be in the wrong if they proceed without considering her circumstances and legal aspects.\n"
