I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. They're in a long-term relationship but not married. The stepdaughter lives with them, works, and has been there since she was 16. The author feels they've tried to build a relationship but it's indifferent at best. Now that the stepdaughter is an adult and working, the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, legal stuff. In most places, once someone is 18, the legal guardian's control ends. The stepdaughter is 19, so the author isn't her legal parent. The mother is the legal parent, and she's okay with her staying. The author's role here is more of a housemate or partner. So the author can't unilaterally kick her out without the mother's consent. Legally, if the mother is allowing her daughter to stay, the author might not have that authority.\n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated. They tried to connect, but it didn't work. But the stepdaughter might not have a history of support from them. The author bought a car, but the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge it. That's a sore point. However, the author's approach now seems harsh. Telling her to leave might be abrupt, especially without considering her feelings or circumstances. The author mentions not caring how she takes it, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe mother's role is important here. The author has asked the mother about the stepdaughter moving out, but the mother doesn't want her to leave. The author is pressuring the mother through this situation. That could strain the relationship between the author and their fianc\u00e9. The mother might feel caught between her partner and her daughter.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to prioritize their own needs over the stepdaughter's. But since the stepdaughter is an adult, she should be responsible for her own living decisions. The author could have approached this by setting boundaries or discussing expectations when the stepdaughter was younger. Now that she's 19, it's about mutual respect. If the author wants her to leave, they need to communicate with both the mother and the stepdaughter, not just decide on their own.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're taking unilateral action without considering legal boundaries or the mother's wishes, and they're being dismissive of the stepdaughter's feelings. The right approach would involve collaboration and respect for all parties' autonomy.\n"
