I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter because she's not moving out even though she's working now. The stepdaughter isn't being forced to stay, but the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's a lease agreement or something that specifies she has to leave. If she's on a lease, they might need to go through a formal eviction process. But if she's just living there without a lease, the author can ask her to leave, but it might still require a legal process. However, the author is planning to ask her to leave, not necessarily evict her. But maybe they're being abrupt about it.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, and they both have been supporting the stepdaughter for years. The author tried to build a relationship but felt rejected, like when the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift. Now they're frustrated and want her out. The author's fianc\u00e9 loves having her there, so there's a conflict there. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over the stepdaughter's autonomy and the fianc\u00e9's wishes.\n\nThe stepdaughter is 19, so she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The author can't force her to leave, but they can set boundaries. However, the author's approach might be considered harsh if it's sudden and without considering the stepdaughter's situation. Also, the author's statement about not caring how she reacts could come off as dismissive. The fianc\u00e9 might feel caught in the middle, especially since she wants her daughter to stay.\n\nSo, the author is within their legal rights to ask the stepdaughter to leave, but ethically, it's questionable. They might be in the wrong if they're not giving her a fair chance or if their approach is abrupt and disrespectful. The key points are the legal right to ask her out, the ethical consideration of how it's handled, and the impact on the family dynamics. If the author is being reasonable and giving her time, it's different, but the way the author frames it might not be the best approach. Therefore, the answer could be A (in the wrong) because of the ethical considerations and lack of consideration for the fianc\u00e9's feelings and the stepdaughter's autonomy, even if legally they can ask her to leave.\n"
