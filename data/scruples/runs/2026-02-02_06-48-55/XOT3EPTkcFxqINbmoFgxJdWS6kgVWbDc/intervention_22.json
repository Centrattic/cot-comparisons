I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship, not married, but living together. Their partner has an adult daughter who's 19 and lives with them. The author and the stepdaughter have a bad relationship, and the author wants to kick her out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the daughter is an adult, she's over 18, so legally, she doesn't have to stay in the house. If she's living there, maybe she's on a lease or paying rent? The question doesn't specify if she contributes financially. If she's not paying rent, the author might be providing her a home without compensation, which could be an issue. Also, if the mother is part of the living arrangement, maybe the author isn't the one who signed the lease. So trying to kick someone out might require legal steps, like an eviction process.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions that they tried to build a relationship but failed. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the gift, and the author has given up. The author seems frustrated and wants the house to themselves. But is it right to kick an adult child out? Well, if the daughter is an adult, she's responsible for her own life. The author isn't her parent, so maybe they don't have the authority to decide when she leaves. The mother might be the one who has more authority here. However, if the mother is okay with her staying, but the author isn't, there's a conflict.\n\nThe author's motivation is wanting the house to themselves. They might feel that they've supported the daughter financially (like buying a car) and now want her to leave. But the daughter isn't their biological child, so maybe they have less obligation. However, they live together, so there's a shared living situation. Without clear agreements on living arrangements and financial responsibilities, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, the author's approach is to push her out regardless of her reaction. That could be seen as harsh, especially if the daughter isn't aware that this is coming. If there's no prior agreement about when she would move out, then it's more of a sudden decision. The mother is probably involved in the living arrangements, so the author might need to discuss this with her first. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might have a right to their own space, but the daughter has her own right to choose where she lives. If the daughter is an adult and the author isn't her legal guardian, then the author can't unilaterally decide to kick her out. They might need to set boundaries, maybe charge rent, or create a timeline for her to move out. But doing it abruptly could be considered wrong if it's not agreed upon.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author's actions might be understandable in wanting their own space, but legally and ethically, it's a gray area. Since the daughter is an adult, the author might not have the right to eject her without proper process. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not handling this through proper channels and for not respecting her autonomy as an adult.\n"
