I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter, who is 19 and lives with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The stepdaughter is an adult, so legally, the author isn't her parent. Unless there's some legal guardianship or custody arrangement, the author doesn't have the authority to force her out against her will. The mother is the one who might have that authority, but the author is not the parent. So legally, the author might be overstepping.\n\nThen there's the ethical and relational angle. The stepdaughter is living with them, and while the author has tried to build a relationship without success, the stepdaughter has been indifferent. The author bought her a car, but she didn't acknowledge it. The mother is okay with her staying, which complicates things because the author's partner is involved in the situation. The author wants the house to be just for them and their fianc\u00e9, which is a personal desire but needs to be balanced with the stepdaughter's right to her own living situation.\n\nThe author's approach seems harsh. Telling the stepdaughter to move out without considering her feelings or the mother's opinion could strain the relationship between the author and their fianc\u00e9. The mother might feel that the author is being unfair, especially since the mother supports the stepdaughter staying. Also, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions about her living arrangements. The author's lack of concern for her reaction might be seen as dismissive.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that they've given their time and resources to support the stepdaughter, and now they want to move forward. The stepdaughter has the financial means to move out, so maybe it's reasonable to expect her to do so. But the author isn't in a position to make that decision unilaterally. It's more appropriate to have a conversation with the stepdaughter and the mother to reach a mutual agreement rather than pushing her out unilaterally.\n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action is considerate and respects others' autonomy. Here, the author's action might be seen as disregarding the stepdaughter's autonomy and the mother's wishes. Even though the author has reasons, the method of handling it is problematic. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're making a unilateral decision without considering the complexities and relationships involved.\n"
