I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author's fianc\u00e9e is her mother.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she's legally an adult. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have legal authority to force her out without her mother's consent. The mother is the one who might be responsible for her living arrangements. The author mentions that the mother is happy having her daughter stay, which complicates things because the author is trying to push her out against the mother's wishes.\n\nThe author's main issue is the strained relationship with the stepdaughter. They tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, like when they bought the car. However, that doesn't automatically give them the right to evict someone. The stepdaughter is also working and saving money, so she's capable of moving out on her own if she chooses to. The author's frustration is about wanting their home back with just their partner, but that's a personal desire that might not consider the mother's and stepdaughter's choices.\n\nLegally, the author likely doesn't have the standing to evict the stepdaughter unless they're listed on the lease or own the property. Since they're not married, their status might not grant them legal authority. Also, the mother's approval is important here. Ethically, it's about respecting the mother's decision and the stepdaughter's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong if they're not using force, but they could be wrong in pressuring the mother and stepdaughter to leave against their will. The key points are legal standing, the stepdaughter's autonomy, and considering the mother's role.\n"
