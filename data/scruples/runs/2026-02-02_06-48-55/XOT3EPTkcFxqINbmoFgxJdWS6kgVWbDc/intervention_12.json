I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with her stepfather and his fianc\u00e9e. The stepfather wants her to move out because he's had a bad relationship with her and wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult, does the stepfather have any legal authority to make her leave? If she's an adult, she doesn't have to leave unless there's a lease issue or something. The stepfather isn't her parent, so he can't legally kick her out. So maybe that's a problem. If he just throws her out without a lease or legal reason, that could be illegal.\n\nAlso, the stepfather's approach seems pretty harsh. He mentions not caring how she takes it. That's pretty cold. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries or having a conversation. But the person is asking if he's in the wrong. If he's not following proper legal procedures, then yes, he's in the wrong. But if the stepdaughter is renting a room from them, then maybe they can set terms. However, the question is more about moral or ethical wrong, not just legal.\n\nThe stepfather did mention that he's been trying to support her, even giving her a car. But now he wants her to leave. Maybe he's justified in wanting some privacy after 8 years. But the method of kicking her out without a proper plan might be the issue. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction is a factor. She loves having her there, so he's possibly going against her wishes, which might strain their relationship.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, if there's no lease, maybe he can't just kick her out. Ethically, using a harsh approach without considering her feelings might be wrong. The answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). But maybe the stepfather is within his rights if he's the landlord. Wait, does the scenario mention ownership? The stepfather and fianc\u00e9e own the house? If the stepdaughter is a tenant, then they need to follow eviction procedures. If she's just living there as a family member, then it's more complicated. The stepfather's approach might be wrong because he's not addressing it properly, maybe violating lease terms or not giving proper notice. So I think the answer is A.\n"
