I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The author has a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9 (not married), and they've been together for 8 years. The stepdaughter, who's 19, lives with them. The author feels they've tried to build a relationship but weren't successful, and now they want her to leave.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: The stepdaughter is an adult, so unless there are specific legal obligations (like financial support), the author might not have any legal obligation to house her. In many places, once someone is 18, they're legally adults, and their living arrangements are their own responsibility unless there's a court order or specific agreement.\n\nEmotional and relational factors: The author mentions that their fianc\u00e9 (the stepdaughter's mother) is okay with her staying. The author is frustrated and wants the house to themselves. However, the stepdaughter is choosing to stay, possibly because she's saving money or not ready to move out yet. The author's frustration is understandable, but the key is whether they have the right to force her out.\n\nEthical considerations: Even if the author is legally allowed to ask her to leave, there's a moral question about their relationship. The author tried to build a relationship but faced indifference. However, kicking someone out can have emotional consequences. The mother (author's fianc\u00e9) might be upset if the stepdaughter is forced out, which complicates things.\n\nPossible responsibilities: If the author has been financially supporting the stepdaughter, maybe through utilities, rent, etc., there's an unspoken responsibility. But since the stepdaughter is working, she might contribute. The author's frustration could stem from feeling taken advantage of, but it's important to check if there's an informal agreement or if the stepdaughter expects continued support.\n\nCommunication: The author has asked the mother, but the stepdaughter isn't planning to leave. The author might need to have a direct conversation with the stepdaughter about expectations, rather than just relying on the mother's input. Also, setting clear boundaries and discussing the financial implications if she stays could be necessary.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have the legal right to ask an adult family member to leave, the ethical and relational aspects are more complex. The answer hinges on whether the author is acting out of justified self-interest or being overly self-centered. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the stepdaughter is an adult, but they should consider the potential consequences for all parties involved, including the mother and the stepdaughter's well-being.\n"
