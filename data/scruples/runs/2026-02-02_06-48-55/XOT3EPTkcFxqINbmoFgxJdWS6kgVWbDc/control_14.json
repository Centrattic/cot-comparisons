I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their stepdaughter. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who has a 19-year-old adult daughter living with them. The stepdaughter and the author have a strained relationship; the author tried to build a bond but the stepdaughter was indifferent. A key event was when the author bought her a car for her 16th birthday, but she thanked the mother instead. After that, the author stopped trying to connect and just remained kind. The author expected the stepdaughter to leave for college when she turned 18, but she didn't. Instead, she started working at a salon and is saving money but hasn't moved out. The author has asked the fianc\u00e9 to talk to the stepdaughter about moving out, but the fianc\u00e9 said the stepdaughter wants to stay. The author wants to push her out now, even if it upsets the fianc\u00e9 and the stepdaughter, because they feel it's time for the house to be just them and their partner.\n\nFirst, I should consider legal aspects. In most places, once a child is 18, they are legally an adult, so the author isn't the legal guardian. The author might not have the legal authority to force the stepdaughter out. If the stepdaughter is paying rent or contributing to household expenses, that might be different. But the post doesn't mention that. It sounds like she's staying there for free, maybe because the author and their fianc\u00e9 have been supporting her. That could be a point about financial responsibility. \n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The author and stepdaughter have a poor relationship. The author tried hard to be involved but was ignored, leading to giving up. The fianc\u00e9 wants her to stay. The author's main motivation is to have the house to themselves without the stepdaughter. There's a sense of entitlement here\u2014the author feels they've \"put in time\" and now want the space back. But the stepdaughter is an adult, so maybe she has the right to choose where to live, especially if she's not causing issues. \n\nEthically, it's about respecting the adult child's autonomy. Even if the relationship is strained, the author can't unilaterally decide to remove her from the home unless there are specific legal agreements in place. The fianc\u00e9's role is also important here. The author is pressuring the fianc\u00e9 to push the daughter out, which might be unfair if the fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying. The stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, like financial stability or emotional support. \n\nThe author's statement about not caring how the stepdaughter takes it is a bit harsh. Adult children can have a right to their own decisions, and being kicked out without a choice could be seen as disrespectful. Also, the author might be projecting their own feelings about the situation onto the fianc\u00e9, assuming it's for the best, but the fianc\u00e9 might have a different perspective. \n\nPossible counterarguments: If the stepdaughter is not contributing and the author is covering her expenses, it could be a financial burden. But the post doesn't clarify if there's any financial arrangement. Also, if the author cohabited with the fianc\u00e9 before the stepdaughter turned 18, maybe they had an implicit understanding. But the stepdaughter's choice to stay might be her right. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author might be in the wrong because they're trying to remove an adult from the home without considering her autonomy and the wishes of the fianc\u00e9. Also, if there's no legal basis, it's a personal decision the stepdaughter has the right to make. The author should have discussed it more respectfully with the fianc\u00e9 and the stepdaughter before deciding to kick her out.\n"
