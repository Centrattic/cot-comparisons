I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship, not married but living together. They have an adult stepdaughter who's 19. The stepdaughter lives with them. The author tried to build a relationship with her but it's been tough. There's a specific incident where he bought her a car for her 16th birthday, but she only thanked her mom. He gave up trying after that. The author expected her to move out after turning 18 when she started working, but she hasn't. Now, the author wants her to leave, even though he's not too concerned about how she takes it, and the fianc\u00e9 might be upset but he hopes she'll see it's for the best.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities here. The stepdaughter is an adult, so she's legally an adult. The author isn't her parent, so maybe he doesn't have the legal right to kick her out. The mother is the fianc\u00e9, so she's the one who might have more say in the living arrangements. The author is trying to push the daughter out, but if the mother is okay with her staying, does the author have the right to do that? \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the stepdaughter is working and saving money. She might not want to leave yet, maybe due to financial reasons or personal choices. The author's frustration is understandable, but is it his responsibility to force her out? The mother (fianc\u00e9) might have a different perspective here. If the author is not the legal guardian, he can't unilaterally decide to remove an adult from the household. That could be a legal issue. \n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to create a home for himself and his fianc\u00e9, which is valid. But the stepdaughter is an adult who's choosing to stay. The author's approach seems harsh, not considering her feelings or reasons. Even if the relationship is strained, forcing someone out without consent could be seen as wrong. The author's attitude of not caring how she takes it might indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nBut then again, if the mother (his fianc\u00e9) is supportive, maybe there's some discussion here. However, the author is making the decision without her agreement, and the fianc\u00e9 might be upset. The author is putting his own needs over the stepdaughter's autonomy. Since she's an adult, she should have the right to choose where to live. The author's actions might be violating her rights as an adult. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's trying to remove an adult from her home without her consent, and he's not her legal guardian. Even if there's a poor relationship, that doesn't justify forcing her out. The answer is A.\n"
