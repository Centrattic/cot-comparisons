I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out his adult stepdaughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e. They're not married but live together. She has an adult daughter, 19 years old, living with them. The stepdaughter has never had a good relationship with the author, despite his efforts. He bought her a car for her 16th birthday, but she didn't acknowledge him. Since then, he's been kind but not trying to improve the relationship.\n\nThe author wants her to move out because he wants the house to be just him and his fianc\u00e9e. She's working now, so he thinks she can afford to move out. He's not too concerned about her reaction and expects his fianc\u00e9e might be upset but hopes she'll agree later.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's not a minor. So the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's some other arrangement. If she's an adult, she can choose to stay or leave as she wishes. But the author is considering kicking her out, which might be seen as overstepping. However, if she's an adult and not his legal responsibility, maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave, especially if she's not his child and he's not her parent.\n\nEmotionally, though, the situation is tricky. The author is frustrated after years of trying to build a relationship and not getting much in return. But pushing her out might be harsh, especially if she's relying on the home for stability. His fianc\u00e9e is supportive of her, so this could strain their relationship. The author's intention is to have the house to himself and his partner, which is understandable, but there's a responsibility to consider the daughter's autonomy and well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the fianc\u00e9e's role. The author is asking her to help push the daughter out, and she's conflicted. Maybe the author should have discussed this more with his fianc\u00e9e before deciding. Also, the daughter might have her reasons for staying, like financial or social, which the author might not be considering.\n\nLegally, unless there's a lease or agreement, the author can't force an adult out of a shared living space. So if it's a house they all live in together without formal agreements, the author can't unilaterally decide. However, if the author is the one paying for the rent/mortgage, he might have more leverage, but that's not mentioned here. The key point is that the stepdaughter is an adult, so the author's authority over her is limited.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it fair to kick someone out for wanting to stay with their mother? The author's frustration is valid, but there's a need for mutual respect. The daughter might have a right to her space, and the author's desire for privacy might not override that. Also, the daughter's indifference might be due to her own issues, not the author's fault. However, the author's decision to stop trying to build a relationship could be part of the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might not be in the wrong if he can establish that the daughter is an adult and he's not her legal guardian. However, ethically, it's questionable because he's making a decision about someone else's living situation without considering her perspective. He's also possibly using his position in the relationship to exert control. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's trying to remove an adult who's not his child without considering her autonomy and the potential harm to his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e.\n"
