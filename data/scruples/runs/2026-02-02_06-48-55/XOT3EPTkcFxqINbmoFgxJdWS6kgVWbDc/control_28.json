I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9, who has an adult daughter living with them. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and the author wants her to leave. The key points here are the legal and emotional aspects.\n\nFirst, legally, the stepdaughter is an adult. In most places, once someone is 18 or 19, they're considered adults and can't be forced to leave unless there's some form of lease agreement or legal guardianship. The author isn't her parent, so he doesn't have legal authority over her. If she's paying rent or contributing, that's different, but the post doesn't mention that. It sounds like she's staying there without contributing, which might be a problem. But just because she's an adult doesn't mean the author can kick her out without consent.\n\nEmotionally, the author and stepdaughter have a strained relationship. The author tried to build a relationship but was met with indifference. Now he wants her to leave. However, the fianc\u00e9 supports her staying, which complicates things. The author's main motivation is wanting the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9, which is understandable, but he might not have considered the stepdaughter's autonomy and the impact on his relationship with his fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author's approach seems a bit harsh. He mentions not caring about her reaction and pushing her out without considering her situation. The stepdaughter might need support, especially if she's saving up to move out. The author could have approached this by setting boundaries or discussing the situation with both his fianc\u00e9 and the stepdaughter before taking action. Since he's not the parent, he doesn't have the right to make that decision unilaterally. The fianc\u00e9's wishes are also important here, and he might be overstepping by making this decision without considering her feelings.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because he's trying to remove an adult from his home without her consent and possibly without considering legal and emotional factors. He should have discussed this more with his fianc\u00e9 and the stepdaughter, ensuring that he's not violating her rights or causing unnecessary conflict.\n"
