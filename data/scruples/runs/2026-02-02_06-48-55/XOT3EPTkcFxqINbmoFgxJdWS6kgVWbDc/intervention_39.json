I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, not married. They live together with her adult daughter, who's 19. The daughter lives at home, works, but hasn't moved out. The author feels he's been patient, tried to build a relationship with her which didn't work, and now wants her to leave. He's considering kicking her out. The user thinks he's in the wrong but wants to know if others agree.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the legal aspect first. The daughter is 19, an adult. In most places, you can't just evict an adult without following legal procedures. If she's on the lease, the author can't unilaterally kick her out. He might need to have a legal eviction process, which could take time and involve the court. So legally, he might be in the wrong if he tries to force her out without following proper steps.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author mentions that he's been patient, gave her a car, tried to be kind. But the daughter hasn't moved out despite being able to. He wants his home back for his relationship. However, the daughter's mother (his fianc\u00e9e) supports her staying. The author wants to push her out, showing a lack of consideration for her feelings and autonomy. This could be seen as dismissive or selfish, especially since the daughter is an adult and has a right to her own space.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has tried to build a relationship and was ignored. Maybe he feels entitled to his personal space. But the key here is that he's her stepfather, not her parent. He's not legally responsible for her, so his obligation to support her might be less. However, if they're living together, it's a shared household. If the fianc\u00e9e supports her daughter staying, it's complicating things.\n\nAnother point: the author says he doesn't care how she takes it. That's pretty harsh. Adult children have the right to live their lives, and forcing someone out without a proper discussion or legal process could be seen as wrong. Also, the fianc\u00e9e might be complicit in keeping her daughter there, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nBut maybe in some cultures or situations, it's expected for adult children to move out. The author's perspective is that she's old enough and should be independent. However, the daughter might have her own reasons for staying, like financial or emotional. The author's approach is abrupt and not considering her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally he's not in the right if he doesn't follow eviction procedures. Ethically, even if he follows the law, pushing her out without a discussion or considering her situation could be seen as wrong. The author's attitude of not caring about her reaction is another red flag. It's about respect and autonomy. So overall, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
