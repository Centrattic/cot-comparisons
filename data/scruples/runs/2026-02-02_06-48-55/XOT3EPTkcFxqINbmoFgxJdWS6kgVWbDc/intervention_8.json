I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19, which is an adult. The author mentions that they've tried to build a relationship but it's been indifferent. The stepdaughter stays in the house even though she's working and could move out. The author's fianc\u00e9e is her biological mother, and she's happy with the stepdaughter living there. The author wants her to leave to have the house to themselves and their partner.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority over her. They can't force her out unless there's some kind of lease or agreement. If she's on the lease, they might need her consent to change the tenancy. If not, they can ask her to leave, but if she refuses, it becomes a legal matter requiring eviction through proper channels. However, the author might not have considered the legal implications here.\n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated after years of a strained relationship. They might feel they've given enough support. But the stepdaughter isn't a child anymore, so the dynamics are different. The author's approach might come off as harsh, not considering her autonomy. The mother (fianc\u00e9e) supports her staying, which complicates things because the author could be seen as overstepping by making a decision that affects her daughter without her full support.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting the adult daughter's choice to live where she wants. The author might believe they have the right to their home, but the home is shared with their partner, who is the mother. The stepdaughter is not their biological child, so the author's responsibility isn't the same as a parent's. However, evicting someone can be a big decision that affects their life. The author's method of not caring about her reaction might be seen as dismissive.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be legally wrong if they follow proper procedures, but ethically, it's questionable. They need to consider the stepdaughter's right to live where she chooses, the mother's wishes, and the potential for a more respectful approach. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering the stepdaughter's autonomy and the partnership with the mother.\n"
