I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a stepfather who's been in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e for 8 years, not married. They live together, and the fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter, 19 years old, who's been living with them. The author wants to kick her out because the relationship between them is bad, and he wants the house to be just him and his fianc\u00e9e. The daughter isn't moving out despite being 19 and working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The daughter is 19, so she's an adult. Legally, can someone kick out an adult who's not their child but their partner's child? If the author is not her legal parent, he doesn't have the authority to make her leave. The mother (his fianc\u00e9e) might be the one with legal custody. If the daughter is an adult, she can choose to stay unless there's a lease or financial agreement. But if the daughter is living there without a lease, maybe as a tenant at will, the landlord could evict her. But if the author is the landlord, then maybe he can. But if he's not on the lease, he might not have that right. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author is frustrated because the stepdaughter doesn't acknowledge him and he's been trying to build a relationship. But she's an adult. Maybe the author is treating her like a child, which isn't appropriate. She's 19, so she should have autonomy. However, the author's fianc\u00e9e might be enabling her by letting her stay. The author might be within his rights if he's the landlord, but ethically, is it right to kick out an adult who's not causing harm beyond just living there?\n\nAlso, the author mentions not caring how she takes it. That's a bit harsh. Even if he's legally allowed to do it, is it the right thing? Maybe there's a way to communicate better. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether there's a better solution.\n\nSo legally, if he's the landlord, then maybe he's not in the wrong. If he's not, then he might be. But the situation is that he lives together with his fianc\u00e9e, who is the mother. Maybe the lease is in the fianc\u00e9e's name. So the fianc\u00e9e would need to ask the daughter to leave. The author pushing to do this might not be his decision to make. So in that case, he's overstepping if he's not the legal landlord. \n\nAlternatively, if they all consider themselves as a household, the daughter might be seen as a guest, but as an adult, she can't be forced out without her consent. So if the author is trying to do this without her mother's agreement, maybe he's not the right person to make that decision. \n\nSo putting it all together, legally, if the author isn't the landlord, he might not have the right. Even if he does, ethically, is it right to kick out an adult daughter who's not a threat? The answer might depend on that legal aspect. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not allowed to do it, then yes. If he is allowed, then maybe not. But since the daughter is an adult, the mother's decision is key. The author's fianc\u00e9e is okay with her staying, so if he goes against her wishes, maybe he's overstepping. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong if he proceeds without considering the legal and relational dynamics properly.\n"
