I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with her mother and her stepfather, who is the fianc\u00e9's partner. The stepdaughter is 19, works, and hasn't moved out. The author wants her out, not caring about her reaction.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. The stepdaughter is an adult, so the author doesn't have legal authority over her. They can't just kick her out without her consent or legal grounds. So legally, the author might be in the wrong if they try to remove her by force or without her leaving voluntarily.\n\nEmotional dynamics: The author's fianc\u00e9 (not married) supports the stepdaughter living there. The author has a strained relationship with her, but the mother (his fianc\u00e9) still wants her here. The author is frustrated and wants the house to be just them two. However, pushing the stepdaughter out without her agreement could cause family conflict. The stepdaughter might not want to leave, and the author's approach could be seen as harsh, especially since he's not her parent. The mother is the one who has legal and parental responsibility.\n\nEthical considerations: Even if the author isn't legally responsible, the stepdaughter might rely on the household for support. Forcing her out without considering her situation could be unethical. The author's reasoning is that she's capable of moving out, but if she's choosing to stay with her mother, that's her decision. The author's disregard for her reaction suggests a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's trying to remove an adult from a home where she's legally allowed to be, without her consent, and without the mother's agreement. The mother's role is key here; if she doesn't support the move, the author can't unilaterally decide. The answer should be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
