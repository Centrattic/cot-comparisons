I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The author isn't her legal parent; her mother is the fianc\u00e9e, and they aren't married. The stepdaughter has been living with them since she was 19, working, and saving. The author feels they've supported her enough and want her to move out.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: In many places, once a child turns 18, they're legally adults. The parent (fianc\u00e9e) might have a responsibility to support until certain age, but if the stepdaughter is 19 and working, maybe the obligation is less. The author isn't her legal guardian, so they might not have legal authority to kick her out. That's a key point. The mother (fianc\u00e9e) is the one who let her stay, so the author can't unilaterally decide.\n\nEthical angle: The author's relationship with the stepdaughter is strained. They tried to build a bond but failed. The stepdaughter isn't moving out despite being able to. The author wants their space back. But is it fair to kick her out without considering her situation? Maybe the author should talk directly to the stepdaughter instead of assuming she doesn't want to leave. The mother might be complicit in letting her stay, so the author might need to discuss with the fianc\u00e9e first rather than acting alone.\n\nEmotional aspect: The author is frustrated and wants their home back. But the stepdaughter might have valid reasons for staying. Forcing her out could be harsh. The author's approach seems abrupt and dismissive of the stepdaughter's feelings, which isn't ideal. However, the author isn't the legal parent, so their authority is questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong legally since they aren't responsible for the stepdaughter's care. However, ethically, there's a lack of direct communication with the stepdaughter and relying on the fianc\u00e9e's input. The answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong, but they should handle it more carefully.\n"
