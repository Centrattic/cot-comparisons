I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong when considering kicking out their stepdaughter. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is not the legal parent of the stepdaughter. The stepdaughter is 19, an adult, and lives with them. The author's fianc\u00e9 (not married) has an adult daughter who has chosen to stay at home. The author has tried to build a relationship but it hasn't worked out. They've even bought her a car, which she didn't acknowledge. Now, they want her to move out because they want their house to themselves.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author has the right to ask the stepdaughter to leave. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's not a legal responsibility of the author. However, the author and their fianc\u00e9 are providing her a place to live. If she's working and saving money but still chooses to stay, does the author have the right to ask her to leave?\n\nI need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once a child is an adult, they can live wherever they want, and the non-parent can't force them out unless there's a lease or specific agreement. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, the author might need to involve the landlord. If not, maybe the author can ask her to leave, but it's more of a social and familial decision.\n\nEthically, the author might feel entitled since they've supported the stepdaughter, but the stepdaughter has the right to make her own choices. The author's desire for privacy and space is valid, but they should consider the financial implications if the stepdaughter can't afford to move out immediately. Also, the fianc\u00e9's role here is important\u2014since she's the parent, she might have a different perspective. The author's approach seems a bit abrupt and dismissive, which could strain family relations.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, they need to handle this sensitively. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If they have the legal right to ask her to leave, then maybe not. But if there's an expectation of support without a legal basis, maybe they are. I think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author can ask an adult to leave their home, but it's a judgment call. However, the way they're handling it without considering the stepdaughter's situation might be problematic. But legally, the author might have the right, so the answer might be B.\n"
