I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of the house. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who is the mother of the 19-year-old stepdaughter. They've been together for 8 years, but aren't married. The stepdaughter lives with them, and the author feels they've tried to build a relationship but it hasn't worked. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, even though she's working and could afford to. The author wants her to leave now.\n\nSo, the key points here. The stepdaughter is an adult, 19 years old. Legally, she's an adult, so she's not a minor. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have legal authority to make her leave. The mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) is the one who has legal responsibility. The author is considering asking her to leave, but since she's an adult, it's up to her whether she stays or goes. \n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that they've put time and effort into supporting her, and now they want their space back. They don't care how she reacts. But since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author can't just kick her out. If the stepdaughter doesn't want to leave, the author can't force her unless there's some legal agreement or if they're providing support that's conditional on her leaving. However, in many cases, unless there's a lease or some legal contract, the author might not have the legal standing to require her to move out. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally. The author is frustrated with the lack of relationship and wanting their own space. However, since the stepdaughter is an adult and living with her mother, the author's fianc\u00e9 might be the one who's responsible for her living arrangements. The author's fianc\u00e9 might be the one who should address it, not the stepfather figure. \n\nSo, the author might be overstepping because they aren't the legal guardian. Even if they're living in the house together, the decision to ask the stepdaughter to leave should come from the mother. The author's fianc\u00e9 might be the one who needs to have that conversation. The author might be in the wrong for trying to assert control over someone who isn't their responsibility. Also, the author's approach of not caring about the stepdaughter's reaction could be seen as dismissive and possibly heartless, especially since she's an adult who might have her own reasons for staying. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author has been supporting her financially and emotionally, and it's reasonable to want some space. However, the ethical issue here is whether the author has the right to make that decision without consulting the mother and considering the stepdaughter's autonomy. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she has the right to choose where she lives, and the author can't unilaterally decide she has to leave. The author's fianc\u00e9's role is crucial here. If the mother is okay with her staying, the author might not have the authority to change that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're trying to control someone else's adult child without legal authority and possibly without considering the mother's role. The author should work with the fianc\u00e9 to address the situation rather than taking unilateral action.\n"
