I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the original post) is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The author isn't married to their partner, but they live together. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and the author has grown tired of her living with them. The main question is whether the author is justified in this action.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, once someone turns 18, they're adults, so they have the right to live where they choose. The author isn't her parent, just her stepfather. So, from a legal standpoint, the author can't force her out without some legal justification. However, if they're sharing a lease, the situation might be different. The user might not have considered the legal aspects here, but that's a factor.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The author mentions that their stepdaughter has been indifferent or hostile. They tried hard to build a relationship but were met with indifference. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, which probably hurt the author. The author has given up trying and is now considering kicking her out. The mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) wants her daughter to stay, which could cause tension in the relationship.\n\nThe author's motivation is to have the house to themselves and their partner. But is it fair to force someone out for that reason? The stepdaughter is working and saving money, but maybe she hasn't moved out yet because of financial reasons or other factors. The author is using their resources to push her out, which could be seen as selfish. However, the author is also in a long-term relationship and has a valid desire for privacy and partnership.\n\nEthically, even if the author isn't legally bound to support the stepdaughter, there might be an expectation of a family-like support system. The author might be overstepping by not considering the stepdaughter's wishes or financial situation. The stepdaughter might need time to get on her feet, and the author is being impatient. Also, the author's approach of not caring about her reaction could be seen as harsh and dismissive, which might be emotionally harmful.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's role is important here. If she's okay with the daughter staying, but the author isn't, there's a conflict in the relationship. The author might need to communicate better with their partner before taking such drastic steps. However, the author's main concern is their own well-being and relationship with their partner.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author has a right to their own home and wants it to be private. But the stepdaughter's autonomy as an adult is also important. The author isn't providing a shared space for someone who doesn't want to leave, but maybe the way they're handling it is abrupt and without consideration. The author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate because they're not giving the stepdaughter a chance to plan her move or address the underlying issues.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they're using their position as a stepfather (and possible financial influence) to force the stepdaughter out without considering her situation and without proper communication. However, there's also an argument that the author has a right to their home. But given that the stepdaughter is an adult and the author isn't her parent, the ethical line is blurry. The harshness of the approach and lack of consideration for the stepdaughter's autonomy and the partner's feelings might tip the scale towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
