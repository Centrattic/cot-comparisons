I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a long-term relationship, not married, but living as a married couple. They have a stepdaughter who's 19, living with them. The author has tried to build a relationship with her but it's been rocky. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, leading the author to give up. Now, the author wants her to move out since she's an adult and can support herself.\n\nSo, the main points here are: The stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't her parent, and she's choosing to stay. The author's partner (the mother) doesn't want the stepdaughter to leave. The author is frustrated and wants the house to be just for them and their partner.\n\nLegally, since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author probably doesn't have the authority to force her to leave unless there's a lease or some agreement. But the mother might be the one with legal responsibility. However, the author is the one initiating the action. \n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The author might feel they've done their part (like buying the car), but the stepdaughter is an adult and should be responsible for her own living situation. However, the mother is supportive of her staying, and the author is in a relationship with the mother. So, is it right for the author to push the stepdaughter out without considering the mother's feelings?\n\nAlso, the author says they don't care how the stepdaughter reacts. That's a bit harsh, but maybe they're justified in their frustration. However, the stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, like financial or emotional support. The author's main concern is wanting privacy with their partner, which is understandable, but maybe they should have had more direct conversations with the stepdaughter instead of just deciding to kick her out.\n\nAnother angle: The stepdaughter is 19, which is still a young age. Maybe she's not ready to move out despite working. The author's approach might be abrupt and could affect the mother's relationship with the daughter. The author's partner (the mother) might not appreciate this unilateral decision.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be \"in the wrong\" legally, but ethically, they might have a responsibility to consider the mother's role and the daughter's situation. The author's approach seems a bit harsh, especially if they didn't communicate their expectations clearly beforehand. Maybe they should have set boundaries when the daughter was younger, but the daughter chose to stay after 18. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong, but there are nuances. But some might argue A (Yes) if they think the author should respect the mother's decision and the daughter's autonomy. However, since the author isn't the parent, maybe they don't have the right to make that decision. But the mother is the one living with the author, so perhaps the author has a valid point about wanting their own space. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. But I think the key here is that the author is not the parent and shouldn't be making unilateral decisions about the daughter's living situation. The mother is the one who should discuss with her daughter. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're overstepping their role, even if they're in a long-term relationship. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
