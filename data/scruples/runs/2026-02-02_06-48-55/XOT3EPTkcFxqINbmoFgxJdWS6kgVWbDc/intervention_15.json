I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of the house. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author is not married to their partner, but they live together as a couple. They have an 19-year-old stepdaughter who lives with them. The author has a strained relationship with her, mentioning that they tried to build a relationship but she was indifferent, even after giving her a car for her birthday. Now that she's 19, she's working but doesn't plan to move out, and the author wants her to leave so they can have the house to themselves.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is that they tried to build a relationship, it didn't work, and now they want her out since she's an adult. The stepdaughter is 19, which in the US is an adult, so legally she could be expected to live independently. But the author is in a position where they're providing a place for her, which might be part of the issue.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Legally, the author might not have the right to kick someone out unless they are the landlord. Since it's their house, if the stepdaughter isn't on the lease, the author could argue that they can set rules. However, if the stepdaughter is a tenant, they might need to follow proper eviction procedures. But the question here is about being in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nMorally, the situation is more complex. The author's partner is okay with her staying, but the author isn't. The stepdaughter isn't violating any house rules, just choosing to stay. The author has given her chances to move out, and when she didn't, they want to push her out. The author is frustrated after years of trying to build a relationship and now feels it's time for her to leave. However, the author's approach seems a bit harsh. They mention not caring about her reaction, which could indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nOn the other hand, the stepdaughter is an adult and might have the means to move out. The author might feel they've done their part in supporting her. But the stepdaughter might feel entitled to stay because of her mother's relationship with the author. The author's fianc\u00e9 is also involved, so this could affect the whole household's dynamics.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's frustration is valid given the long-term effort without reciprocation, but the method of dealing with it (just wanting to kick her out) might be inconsiderate. The author should have discussed this more with the stepdaughter and possibly found a solution that's respectful, rather than being blunt and not caring about her reaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and communication, even if they have the right to ask her to leave. The stepdaughter is an adult, so she should be given a chance to find her own place without being forced out abruptly. The author's approach could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
