I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the author (let's call them \"WIBTA\") should kick out their stepdaughter, who's 19 and lives with them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The stepdaughter is an adult, 19 years old. The author is in a long-term relationship with the mother, not married, but living together. They've been dating for 8 years. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out, even after turning 18 and working. The author feels they've supported her for years and now want her to leave.\n\nThe author mentions that they tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. They gave up after an incident where the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge them even though they bought her a car. Now, they want to kick her out, not caring about her reaction, and possibly causing tension with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out. The mother might still have some legal say, but once someone is 18, they are adults. Unless there's a lease or specific agreement, the stepdaughter is an adult and can choose to stay or leave. So, legally, the author can't just kick her out without her consent or a lease agreement that allows that.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even though the author might not like the situation, the stepdaughter is an adult. It's her choice where she lives. The author's approach seems abrupt and maybe not considering the stepdaughter's autonomy. The author is using a \"push out of the nest\" approach, but the stepdaughter might need more support or time. Also, the author's attitude of not caring about her reaction could be seen as dismissive or harsh.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 might be upset because she likes having her daughter there. The author is putting their own needs above the daughter's current wishes, which might not be fair. The mother's role here is also important. The author asked the mother about the daughter's plans, and the mother said she wants to save money and stay. If the mother is okay with this, maybe the author shouldn't interfere, even if they disagree.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is supporting the stepdaughter financially, and the daughter isn't contributing enough. But the author hasn't mentioned rent or responsibilities. If the daughter is working and contributing, maybe she's paying her way. If not, maybe there's an issue there, but the scenario doesn't specify.\n\nAnother angle: The author might feel that they've done their part and now want the space. But this is a common conflict in blended families. The author's frustration is valid, but the solution of just \"kicking her out\" could be seen as wrong because it's not the stepdaughter's fault. She's an adult, so the author's approach is more about their own discomfort rather than the daughter's behavior.\n\nIn summary, while the author's feelings are understandable, forcing an adult child out without her consent, especially in a non-legal context, could be considered wrong. The stepdaughter has the right to make her own living arrangements, and the author should have a more collaborative approach, perhaps discussing with the mother and the daughter herself instead of unilaterally deciding.\n"
