I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, and they live together. The fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter who's 19 and lives with them. The author has tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but hasn't succeeded. There's a specific incident where he bought her a car, and she didn't acknowledge him. Now, she works and could move out, but she's staying. The author wants her to leave so the house is just for him and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nSo, the key points here: The stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so the author doesn't have parental authority over her. The author is considering asking her to leave. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects. If the author is the one who allows her to stay in the house, then he might have the right to ask her to leave since it's his home. However, if he's providing financial support or if there's a lease involved, that could complicate things. But in the scenario, the stepdaughter is working and has the means to move out. The author mentions she has more than enough to move on her own, so maybe he's not providing financial support anymore.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: The author's relationship with the stepdaughter is strained. He's tried but given up. His main desire is privacy with his partner. But the stepdaughter is an adult and might have her own reasons for staying. The fianc\u00e9e supports her staying, which adds another layer. The author is dismissive of their potential upset.\n\nLegally, as a landlord, he can ask any adult tenant to leave, but if there's a lease or if she's a co-tenant, that might not hold. However, if she's not on the lease, he can set a timeline for her to vacate. Emotionally, though, it's a sensitive situation. The author's approach seems abrupt and uncaring, which might be seen as harsh, but not necessarily wrong if he's the homeowner.\n\nBut wait, is the author the homeowner? The post doesn't specify. If he's renting with his fianc\u00e9e, he might not have the authority to remove someone. The answer hinges on whether he owns the home and if she's a tenant. The original post says \"my house,\" so maybe he owns it. If so, and she's an adult, he can ask her to leave. However, if she's been there a while, there might be implied rights, but without a lease, it's more his decision.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. He's trying to reclaim his home, but cutting off an adult who's not his responsibility. On the other hand, he's not supporting her financially anymore, so he's not obligated. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) if legal rights are on his side. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014without caring about her reaction\u2014might be seen as harsh, but that's a personal choice. Legally, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
