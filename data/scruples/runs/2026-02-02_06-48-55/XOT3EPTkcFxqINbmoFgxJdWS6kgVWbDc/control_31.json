I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter, who lives with them and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult. Legally, if she's over 18, the biological parent can't force her to stay. But since the author is the stepfather, they might not have legal authority over her. However, if the stepdaughter is still under their roof and the author is providing a home, there might be some expectations or agreements about living arrangements. But as an adult, she has the right to choose where she lives. So the author can't just kick her out unless there's some specific legal arrangement, like a lease agreement where she's a tenant. If she's not on the lease, maybe the author can ask her to leave, but if she's on it, they might need to follow eviction procedures.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The author mentions that their stepdaughter has never had a good relationship with them. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, which is a sore point. The author has tried to build a relationship but was met with indifference. Now they're done and want her to leave. The fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author wants the house to themselves and their fianc\u00e9. The author is considering pushing her out, not caring about her reaction.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author is the person who has been supporting the stepdaughter financially, perhaps. If the stepdaughter is choosing to stay because it's convenient and she has savings, maybe she's taking advantage. However, since she's an adult, she can make her own choices. The author might feel entitled to ask her to leave since they've provided a home, but if there's no legal agreement, it's more about personal responsibility on the stepdaughter's part. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach of just kicking her out might be abrupt and could be seen as selfish if the stepdaughter feels entitled to stay.\n\nAlso, considering the fianc\u00e9's role, the author is asking the fianc\u00e9 to potentially support this decision, but the fianc\u00e9 might be conflicted. The author's fianc\u00e9 might want to maintain the status quo, but the author is prioritizing their own needs. However, the author's right to their home is important too. If the stepdaughter isn't paying rent or contributing to household expenses, the author could be justified in asking her to leave. If she is contributing, maybe not.\n\nBut the key here is that the stepdaughter is an adult. Even if the author provided a home, once she's an adult, she's responsible for her own living arrangements. The author might not be in the wrong if they've provided a home and now want her to leave. However, the way the author is approaching it\u2014being blunt and not caring about her reaction\u2014might come off as harsh, but legally and ethically, if there's no obligation to keep her there, the author might be within their rights.\n\nBut maybe the author is in the right because they're not obligated to house an adult. However, if there's an expectation that she would move out once she's able, the author's request could be reasonable. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to ask an adult child to leave after a certain point. However, the method of doing so without considering the stepdaughter's feelings could be seen as harsh, but not necessarily wrong.\n"
