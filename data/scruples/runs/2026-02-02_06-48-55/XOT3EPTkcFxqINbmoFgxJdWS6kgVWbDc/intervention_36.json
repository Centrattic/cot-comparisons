I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be the Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter who's living with her mother's boyfriend, who is not married to her mother but in a long-term relationship. The author wants to kick the daughter out because he's tired of trying to build a relationship with her and wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the daughter is 19 and an adult, the mother might not have legal authority to force her to stay. The mother's boyfriend, however, isn't a legal guardian. So if the daughter doesn't want to leave, can he actually make her? Legally, maybe not unless she's on some form of lease or there's a contract. But the user is more interested in the social/ethical aspect, not the legal.\n\nEthically, the author has been trying to be kind but feels ignored and wants his space back. The daughter is financially independent but choosing to stay. The mother supports her staying. The author's main issue is the strained relationship and wanting the house to himself. Is it fair to kick someone out just because there's tension? The daughter isn't a child anymore, so the mother shouldn't be keeping her there against her will if she's an adult. However, the author is not the parent, so his authority here is questionable. \n\nThe author might be overstepping by wanting to remove someone who isn't his legal responsibility. The daughter can choose where to live as an adult. The author's frustration is valid, but acting unilaterally could be seen as selfish. The mother's happiness is also a factor since she's happy having her daughter there. The author's approach could damage relationships without a good reason. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not the parent and is pushing for her removal without considering other solutions or respecting her autonomy.\n"
