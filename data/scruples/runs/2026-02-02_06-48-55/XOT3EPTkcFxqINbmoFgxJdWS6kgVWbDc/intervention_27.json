I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, and they live together. The fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter who is 19 and lives with them. The author and the fianc\u00e9e aren't married, but they're together for 8 years. The author proposed with the understanding they wouldn't get married. The stepdaughter has a bad relationship with the author, and he's frustrated because she's still living at home even though she's an adult and can work.\n\nThe author wants to kick her out because he wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9e. He's not concerned about her reaction and thinks it's time for her to move out. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legal stuff. Since the author isn't the legal parent of the stepdaughter, he doesn't have parental rights. So, if the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult. Legally, the author can't force her to leave the house unless there's a lease or some agreement that requires her to move out. But if she's an adult and on the lease, he can't just kick her out without legal grounds. He might need to go through a formal eviction process, which could be complicated if there's no lease or if she's a tenant.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions that he's been trying to build a relationship with her but it's been indifferent. He's frustrated and wants the house back. However, he's using his fianc\u00e9e's house, so maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on him. The fianc\u00e9e might be the one who's been supporting the daughter financially. If the author isn't the one providing financial support, is it fair for him to demand she move out? Also, the daughter is an adult and has a job, so maybe she can move out on her own. But if the author is the one who owns the house, and the daughter is a tenant, then perhaps he can ask her to leave, but he needs to follow proper procedures.\n\nAnother angle: the author's relationship with the daughter is poor, but he's using that as a reason to kick her out. Is it fair to use personal dislike as a justification for eviction? Especially since she's an adult. If she's not causing harm or violating house rules, maybe it's harsh to force her out. But if the living situation is untenable for the author, he might have a right to ask her to leave, provided he does it legally.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's role. If the fianc\u00e9e is the one who's allowing the daughter to stay, the author might need to have a conversation with her first. The author might be overstepping if he decides unilaterally to kick her out without considering her feelings or the daughter's situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might be able to proceed if he can follow the proper eviction process, but ethically, it's questionable. Since the daughter is an adult, she should be responsible for her own living arrangements. But the author's motivation (personal dislike and wanting the house to himself) without considering the daughter's wishes or the fianc\u00e9e's input could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong if he's not following legal procedures or if he's being selfish without considering the daughter's autonomy. Alternatively, if the author is the homeowner and the daughter isn't contributing or causing issues, he might have a point, but the way he's approaching it (not caring about her reaction) could be problematic.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's using personal dislike as a reason to evict an adult daughter who isn't his legal responsibility. The proper way would be to talk to his fianc\u00e9e and find a mutual solution rather than unilaterally deciding to kick her out. Also, without a lease, it's unclear if he can legally do that. So, the answer is A.\n"
