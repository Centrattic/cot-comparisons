I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author feels they've given enough support and now want her to move out. The author's partner (who they're not married to) is okay with her staying, but the author is frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's a lease agreement or something that specifies her living situation. If she's on a lease, the author might need to follow proper eviction procedures. If she's just living there without a formal agreement, the author can't just kick her out without her consent or a legal process. But maybe the author is in a position where they can set boundaries since they're not her legal guardians.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions they've tried to be kind but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The author feels they've supported her financially and now wants her to move out. The stepdaughter is choosing to stay, maybe because she's saving money. The author's main concern is their own peace and the desire for privacy with their partner.\n\nI should also think about the relationship dynamics. The author and their partner are not married, which might affect how responsibilities are shared. The author's partner might be more lenient, but the author is taking a firm stance. The stepdaughter's lack of gratitude (like not thanking the author for the car) might contribute to the author's frustration.\n\nBut is it the author's place to decide when she leaves? The stepdaughter is an adult and can choose to stay or go. If the author is providing a place to live, the stepdaughter might be considered a tenant, requiring proper notice. However, if there's no formal agreement, maybe the author can ask her to leave, but it's still a sensitive situation.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of not caring about her reaction could be seen as harsh. The stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, like financial instability or needing support, even if she's 19. The author might not consider her perspective, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally, if the author can follow proper procedures, they might be in the right. Ethically, it's more complex. The author has the right to their home, but pushing someone out without considering their situation might be seen as wrong. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances of their living arrangement and the cultural context.\n"
