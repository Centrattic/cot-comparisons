I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their stepdaughter. The author is in a long-term relationship, not married but living as married. Their partner has an adult daughter (19) who lives with them. The author has tried to build a relationship but was snubbed when they bought a car for the stepdaughter, who only thanked the mother. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out yet, even though she's working and the author feels it's time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the daughter is 19, she's an adult, so legally, the author can't just kick her out without her consent. The author doesn't have legal authority over her. The mother, being the parent, might have a different situation, but the author isn't the parent. So the author can't unilaterally decide to remove an adult from the home unless they're being a tenant. If the daughter is a tenant, the author would have to follow eviction processes, which vary by location but generally require proper notice and court orders. If the daughter is being supported financially, that's different from legal obligations.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has tried to build a relationship but was met with indifference. The stepdaughter isn't leaving, and the author feels entitled to the house being just for their partner and themselves. However, the author is not the parent; the mother is. The author's role might be more of a co-parent or a partner who's been involved in the daughter's life. But the daughter's choice to stay might be based on her own reasons\u2014maybe financial, social, or personal. The author might feel resentful, but pushing her out without her consent could be seen as controlling or neglecting her autonomy.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e is the mother, and she supports the daughter staying, which complicates things. The author's approach of \"pushing her out of the nest\" might be seen as harsh, especially if the daughter is not a tenant and there's no legal obligation for her to move out. The author should perhaps communicate more directly with the daughter, set boundaries, or have the mother discuss the matter with her. The author's lack of concern for the daughter's reaction is problematic because it shows a disregard for her feelings and autonomy as an adult.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because they can't legally force the daughter out without proper process, and ethically, they should respect the daughter's choice to live there, especially if it's not a tenant situation. The author should handle this through communication and possibly involving the mother or legal means if necessary. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
