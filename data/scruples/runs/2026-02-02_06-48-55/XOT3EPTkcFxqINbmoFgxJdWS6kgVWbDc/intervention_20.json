I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with her stepfather, and the author wants to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a long-term, unmarried relationship with his fianc\u00e9e. The stepdaughter is 19, works, and has been living at home. The author has tried to build a relationship but feels ignored. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out despite being an adult. The author is considering kicking her out to have the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nThe author mentions that he's not concerned with the stepdaughter's reaction. The main question is whether he's in the wrong by doing this.\n\nLegally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and not a minor, she can't be forced out unless there's a lease agreement or specific legal arrangements. Since she's 19 and working, she's an adult, so legally, she can choose to stay or leave. However, if the author is providing financial support or housing, there might be ethical considerations.\n\nEthically, the author is in a position where he's providing a home for an adult who isn't his biological child. The stepdaughter might be relying on this arrangement. The author's frustration is understandable, but kicking her out without proper notice or support could be seen as harsh, especially if she's not in a position to move out immediately. The fact that the author's fianc\u00e9e is in favor of her staying might also be a point of contention if the author acts unilaterally.\n\nThe author's approach is blunt, and he's dismissive of her feelings. While he's not obligated to support her, the way he's handling it might lack empathy. There's also the aspect of communication\u2014perhaps a more constructive approach, like setting boundaries or discussing the situation with the stepdaughter directly, could have been tried before deciding to kick her out.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because he's treating an adult as if they have no choice, without considering her autonomy or circumstances. Ethically, supporting an adult to transition out on their own terms is usually better. However, legally, he might have the right to ask her to leave if it's his property. But since it's a shared living situation with a fianc\u00e9e, there might be complications if she's on the lease. The main issue is the lack of consideration for the stepdaughter's situation and the abruptness of the action. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ethical and empathetic aspects, even if legally he's not necessarily wrong.\n"
