I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, who has an adult daughter (19 years old) living with them. The author and stepdaughter have a bad relationship, and he wants her to move out. The key points are: the girl is 19, working, has her own money, and the author is considering kicking her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once a child turns 18, they are legally adults and can't be forced to leave unless there's some legal agreement or a lease. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, the author can't just kick her out without going through legal channels. If she's not on the lease, then maybe she can be asked to leave, but that might depend on state laws and whether she's considered a tenant. Also, if she's been living there for a while, even without a lease, she might have tenant rights.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The author is frustrated with the lack of relationship and wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e. But the stepdaughter is an adult and might have a right to privacy and autonomy. The author's approach of just \"kicking her out\" without considering her feelings or options could be seen as harsh. Even if he's not emotionally invested, there's a responsibility to handle the situation respectfully, maybe by discussing it with her first, not just her mother. The author is relying on the mother to talk to her, but the stepdaughter might value direct communication.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e seems okay with the situation, but the author is pushing for change. There's also the question of financial support. If the author has been supporting her financially, maybe he expects her to leave once she's self-sufficient. But if she's choosing to stay, it's her choice as long as she can afford it. The author might be in a position where he can't unilaterally decide that. Maybe a more appropriate step would be to set boundaries, have a conversation, or give a notice if they're on a lease.\n\nSo putting it all together: legally, if the stepdaughter is a tenant, the author can't just kick her out without proper notice or legal process. Ethically, it's important to handle the situation respectfully, considering her autonomy. The author's approach seems abrupt and possibly disrespectful, not giving her a chance to respond. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not following proper procedures and being dismissive of her situation. So the answer would be A.\n"
