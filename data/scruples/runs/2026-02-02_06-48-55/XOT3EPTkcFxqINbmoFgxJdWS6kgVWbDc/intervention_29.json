I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking their adult stepdaughter out of their house. The scenario involves a stepfather in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, who has an adult daughter living with them. The stepfather has had a strained relationship with the daughter and now wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult, the stepfather doesn't have legal authority over her. Unless there's a legal agreement or some form of guardianship, he can't force her out without her consent. Legally, he might not have the right to ask her to leave if she's an adult and not a tenant. If she's been working and saving, maybe she's contributing to the household, but that's not specified here. Also, if the home is owned by the fianc\u00e9e, her input is important, but the stepfather is the one considering the action.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the situation is tricky. The stepfather has tried to build a relationship but faced indifference. He's frustrated and wants his space back. However, kicking someone out without considering their feelings or circumstances can be seen as harsh. The stepdaughter might not have alternative housing, and the mother (his fianc\u00e9e) supports her staying, which complicates things. The stepfather's approach seems abrupt and dismissive of her potential feelings, even if he doesn't care about her reaction.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The stepfather hasn't directly talked to the stepdaughter about moving out, only through the fianc\u00e9e. Maybe a more collaborative approach could have been taken, like setting a timeline for her to find her own place. The stepdaughter might not have the means to move out immediately, so pushing her without support could be unfair.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the stepfather has supported her financially (like buying the car), but that's a one-time gesture. Now he's expecting her to leave once she's \"ready.\" However, adult children sometimes stay due to various reasons like financial stability, job location, or emotional ties. The stepfather's frustration is valid, but his solution might be too abrupt and self-serving, not considering her autonomy and choices.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's role is also a factor. She wants her daughter to stay, which suggests there's a family dynamic at play. The stepfather's decision might strain their relationship, even if he's not legally bound by it. The overall situation shows a lack of mutual respect for the stepdaughter's autonomy and the fianc\u00e9e's desire. The stepfather's approach could be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own needs over the well-being and wishes of others involved.\n\nPutting it all together, the stepfather is in a position where he's using his authority in the household to push for the stepdaughter's eviction without her consent or consideration of her circumstances. This could be seen as wrong because it disregards her autonomy and the dynamics of the household. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
