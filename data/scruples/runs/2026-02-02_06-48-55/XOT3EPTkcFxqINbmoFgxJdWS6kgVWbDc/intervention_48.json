I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a man in a long-term relationship (8 years) but not married. They live together, and he proposed without the intention of marriage. His fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter, 19, who's been living with them. The stepdaughter and the author have a poor relationship, with the stepdaughter being indifferent. The author tried to bond, even bought her a car, but she didn't acknowledge him. Now the stepdaughter is working and not moving out. The author wants to kick her out to have the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. In many places, once someone turns 18, they're legally an adult. The author isn't the legal parent, so he doesn't have the authority to make her leave unless she's under his legal guardianship, which she's not. The mother (his fianc\u00e9e) might have that responsibility. If he kicks her out, could that be illegal? Possibly, depending on local laws. Even if it's legal, there might be ethical considerations.\n\nEthically, the author's approach seems harsh. The stepdaughter is an adult and has a right to her space. While the author has tried to build a relationship, the stepdaughter's indifference is her choice. Forcing her out without a fair discussion might be inconsiderate. Also, the mother's role is important here. The author is trying to pressure the mother, but maybe the mother should discuss this with her own daughter first. The author's statement about not caring how she reacts is dismissive and could damage relationships further.\n\nAnother angle: the author's desire for privacy is valid, but the approach is confrontational. A better solution might be to have a conversation with both the stepdaughter and the fianc\u00e9e to find a mutual agreement. Maybe setting a timeline for moving out, or offering support if she needs help finding a place. The author's abrupt action without considering the stepdaughter's feelings or circumstances could be seen as wrong.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings are mentioned, but the author is dismissive of the stepdaughter's. This could create tension in the relationship if the fianc\u00e9e sides with the daughter. The author's reasoning is based on his own desires without considering the daughter's reasons for staying. Maybe she's saving money, but if she's not moving, maybe she has valid reasons the author isn't aware of.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be legally questionable and ethically inconsiderate. The right approach would involve communication and mutual agreement rather than unilateral action. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
