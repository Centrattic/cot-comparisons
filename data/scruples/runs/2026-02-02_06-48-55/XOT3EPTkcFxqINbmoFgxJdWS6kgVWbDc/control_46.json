I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is in a long-term relationship, not married, with a partner who doesn't want to get married again. They have an adult daughter (19) from the partner's previous marriage. The author tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but faced indifference and even neglect (like not being thanked for the car). The stepdaughter is now working and not moving out, which the author wants to change. The author feels they've supported her for years and now wants her to leave.\n\nNow, considering legal and social norms. Legally, once someone is an adult (18+ in the US), they have the right to live wherever they choose. So the author can't really force her out unless she's a tenant. If she's still considered a dependent, maybe there are obligations, but once she's 18, that's less clear. Socially, the author tried to be kind but gave up after being ignored. The stepdaughter isn't contributing to the household? Wait, she's working at a salon. So maybe she is contributing financially? But the author might not see it that way.\n\nThe author's motivation is wanting privacy with their partner. That's understandable. However, the method\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be abrupt. The author mentions not caring about her reaction, which could be seen as harsh. The stepdaughter might need time, or maybe there's an underlying issue (like emotional ties or lack of support elsewhere). The author's approach doesn't seem to consider her feelings or circumstances beyond their own needs.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, legally, they might not be, but morally or socially, maybe. The stepdaughter is an adult, so she should have the autonomy to choose. The author could have approached it with more compassion, maybe setting boundaries or discussing moving out terms. But outright kicking her out without her consent could lead to conflict. The author's disregard for her feelings might be the issue here. The partner might also be upset if the move causes strain.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considerate of the stepdaughter's autonomy and well-being. Since the author isn't in a legal position to force her out but is choosing to do so for personal reasons without considering her adult child's perspective, it's possible the author is in the wrong. However, if the stepdaughter is a tenant and the author is her landlord, then they can give notice. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal. The author's lack of empathy and abrupt approach could be problematic.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're prioritizing their own needs over the stepdaughter's autonomy and well-being without considering her side. Even if the stepdaughter is an adult, the way the author is handling it is dismissive and could be harmful.\n"
