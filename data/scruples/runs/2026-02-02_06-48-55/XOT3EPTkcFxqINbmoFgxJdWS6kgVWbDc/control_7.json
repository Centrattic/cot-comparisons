I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of the house. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship (8 years) with their fianc\u00e9e, and they're not married. The fianc\u00e9e's daughter is 19 and lives with them. The stepdaughter has never had a good relationship with the author. The author tried to be kind but the stepdaughter was indifferent, even not acknowledging a car gift. The author stopped trying and just waited for her to move out. When she turned 18, they thought she'd go to school, but she started working at a salon instead. Now she's 19 and wants to stay. The author feels it's time for her to move out, even if it upsets the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she's legally responsible for herself. The author is the fianc\u00e9, not the parent. They live as a married couple but aren't legally married. The fianc\u00e9e (the mother) is the legal guardian, so she's the one who brought the daughter into the house. The author might not have legal authority to kick someone out unless they are the landlord or have legal custody, which they don't. The author might be using emotional arguments, but legally, the mother is the one who can make that decision. The author could be overstepping by making this choice without the mother's full agreement, especially since the mother seems to want the daughter to stay. The author's frustration is understandable, but the action might be legally and ethically problematic because it's the mother's responsibility. The stepdaughter has the right to live where she chooses as an adult, unless there's a lease or legal agreement. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they don't have the authority to evict an adult who isn't their legal dependent. However, if the mother is on board, maybe they can ask her to leave. But the author is taking it upon themselves without the mother's full support. The key here is legal and ethical boundaries. The author might be wrong to assume they can control the living situation of an adult who isn't their legal child.\n"
