I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, works, and has been living with her mother and the author. The author and their fianc\u00e9e aren't married but have been together for 8 years. The author feels they've supported the stepdaughter, like buying her a car, and now wants her to move out so it's just them and their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's some legal guardianship or financial responsibility. But if she's 19 and working, maybe she's not under their care anymore. Legally, she's an adult, so the author can't just kick her out without her agreement or a court order. So maybe the author is overstepping there.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The author mentions they've tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. Now they want to push her out, not really caring how she reacts. That seems harsh. Even if the relationship is strained, treating someone with respect is important. The author's fianc\u00e9e might be upset, but the stepdaughter's feelings are dismissed.\n\nAlso, the author's fianc\u00e9e is okay with the stepdaughter staying. The author is going against her wishes to some extent. Maybe the author should have discussed this more with their partner before taking action. The stepdaughter isn't a child anymore; she should have the autonomy to decide where she lives. The author might be acting out of self-interest, wanting the house to themselves, which isn't fair to the stepdaughter.\n\nBut then, the author did support her in the past. However, the stepdaughter chose to stay, and maybe the author isn't obligated to keep supporting her. But again, kicking her out without her consent is problematic. The author's approach seems abrupt and disrespectful. They should probably communicate with the stepdaughter first, set boundaries, and maybe give her time to move out on her own terms instead of forcing her.\n\nSo overall, the author is in the wrong because they can't unilaterally decide to evict an adult living in their house without consent. The approach lacks respect for the stepdaughter's autonomy and the author's partner's opinion. They should handle it more diplomatically.\n"
