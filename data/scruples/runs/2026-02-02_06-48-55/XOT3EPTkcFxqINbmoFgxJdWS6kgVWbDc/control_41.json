I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author's fianc\u00e9 is the stepdaughter's mother. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially when buying a car for her. Now they want her to leave because they want the house to themselves. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult (19), she's legally an adult, so the author doesn't have the legal right to force her out without her consent. The mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) might still have some legal responsibility if the stepdaughter is a dependent, but since she's working and saving, maybe not. However, the author isn't her parent, so they can't just kick her out.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions trying to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. However, the author's fianc\u00e9 wants her to stay. The author is considering pushing her out without considering her wishes. Maybe the stepdaughter wants to stay and is saving up to move out on her own terms. Forcing her out could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author isn't her parent.\n\nAlso, the author's approach seems a bit harsh. They don't care how she takes it, which shows a lack of empathy. The fianc\u00e9 might be upset, and the stepdaughter might have valid reasons for staying. The author's main motivation is personal desire for privacy, which is understandable, but the method might be wrong. They should probably talk to the stepdaughter directly instead of using the fianc\u00e9 as a middleman.\n\nIn terms of rights, the stepdaughter has the right to make her own decisions. If she's paying rent or contributing in some way, the author might need to respect that. If she's not paying and just living there, maybe the author can set boundaries, like requiring her to pay rent or leave. But just kicking her out without negotiation could be wrong. The author's fianc\u00e9's stance is also important. If she's in favor of supporting their daughter, the author can't unilaterally decide to remove her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they're not considering the stepdaughter's autonomy and the dynamics of their household. They should communicate directly with her, maybe set clear expectations, and work towards a mutual solution rather than unilaterally deciding to kick her out. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not handling it respectfully or ethically, possibly overstepping their role.\n"
