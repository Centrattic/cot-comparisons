I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who has an adult daughter living with them. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and hasn't moved out yet. The author feels they've tried to build a relationship but it's not working out. They've been patient, expecting her to leave after 18, but she hasn't. Now they want her to move out, even if it upsets the fianc\u00e9.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, once someone is an adult, the household's responsibility isn't mandatory. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have legal obligation. But ethically? The stepdaughter chose to stay. The author's approach seems abrupt and possibly harsh, not discussing it with her first. However, the author's fianc\u00e9 might have a different view since they enjoy her presence. The stepdaughter might not have financial independence yet, despite working. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of \"kicking her out\" without a conversation might be the issue. Maybe the author should have discussed it more with the fianc\u00e9 and the stepdaughter first. But is it wrong to want this? Maybe not, but the approach matters. The key is whether the author has the right to do this. Legally yes, as it's their house. Ethically, others might see it as harsh, but it's not necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
