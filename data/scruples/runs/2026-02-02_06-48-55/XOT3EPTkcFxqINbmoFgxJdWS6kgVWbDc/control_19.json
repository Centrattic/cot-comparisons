I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author wants her to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, once someone turns 18, they're legally an adult. So the stepdaughter can choose to stay or leave. However, the author might not have legal authority to force her out unless they are her legal guardian. If they're not married, maybe the stepdaughter's mother is her legal guardian. The author's fianc\u00e9 is the mother, right? So the mother might be the one who has legal say. \n\nThen, the relationship dynamics. The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. The stepdaughter was indifferent, even after the car gift. The author has been kind but not trying to connect anymore. The mother wants her daughter to stay, which complicates things because the author is in a relationship with the mother. \n\nEthically, is it fair to kick someone out after they've been living with you for years? Especially if they're not causing trouble. The author wants the house to themselves and their partner. But the stepdaughter is an adult and may not have obligations to leave unless she's on their financial support. If she's working and saving, maybe she's contributing, so the author's argument is weaker. \n\nThe author's approach seems abrupt. They don't mention discussing it with the stepdaughter first. Just pushing her out might be seen as harsh, even if legally possible. The mother's feelings are also a factor. \n\nSo, the author might not be legally wrong if the stepdaughter is an adult and not under their legal care. But ethically, it's questionable if they didn't consider the stepdaughter's autonomy or financial situation. The answer hinges on legal guardianship. If the author isn't the legal guardian, they can't force her out. If they are, maybe they can, but it's still a moral issue. Since the author's fianc\u00e9 is the mother and she's happy for the daughter to stay, the author is overriding her wishes. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on legal aspects, but since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, they could be. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author can't force her to leave unless they're the landlord. If the house is their property, maybe they can set rules. But if the stepdaughter is a tenant, they need to follow proper procedures. \n\nWait, the author is in a long-term relationship but not married. So the house might be in the author's or the fianc\u00e9's name. If the author is the landlord, they can ask her to leave. But if it's a shared home, maybe they need to all agree. \n\nThis is complicated. But since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author can't necessarily force her out without legal justification. So maybe the author is in the wrong for assuming they have the authority to do so without considering legal and ethical implications.\n"
