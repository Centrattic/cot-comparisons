I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the author isn't married to his partner, but they live together as if they are. The stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author wants her to leave because the relationship is bad and they want the house to themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since she's an adult, she's not a minor, so the author doesn't have legal authority over her. If she's been working and saving, maybe she's financially independent. The author can't just evict her without going through proper legal steps, like a lease agreement or a court order if she's a tenant.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The author felt that he tried to build a relationship but failed. He bought her a car, which she didn't acknowledge. Now he's given up and wants her to leave. The stepdaughter stays because she wants to save money and her mom supports her. The author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her living there, but he wants her out for personal reasons.\n\nIs it wrong? Legally, if she's not on the lease, he might need to talk to her about moving out. If she's on the lease, he can't just kick her out without her consent or legal action. Ethically, the author wants the house to himself and his partner, but the stepdaughter has her own reasons to stay. The author might feel justified, but forcing someone out without considering their feelings or circumstances could be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the author doesn't care how she reacts, which shows a lack of empathy. Even if the relationship is bad, treating someone with respect is important. The stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, maybe financial constraints or personal choices. The author's main motivation is his own desire for space, which might not take her needs into account.\n\nSo, legally, he's probably not in the wrong if he handles it properly, but ethically, he might be neglecting her situation and his responsibility. The key here is whether he's using the right approach. If he's not following legal steps, he's wrong. But even if he does, pushing her out without considering her well-being could be seen as wrong.\n"
