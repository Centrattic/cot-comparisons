I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author wants her to move out. They're not married, but have a long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, there's no legal obligation for the author to provide her housing. Adult children generally don't have a legal right to stay in their parents' homes. However, since it's a stepfamily, the dynamics might be different. The author isn't her biological parent, but they've been living together for a while.\n\nThe author mentions they tried to build a relationship but failed. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, which hurt the author. Now, the author wants to push her out because they want privacy with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author isn't.\n\nEthically, it's a grey area. The author isn't legally responsible, but maybe they feel a moral obligation. The stepdaughter might not have a place to go, so just kicking her out without support could be harsh. The author is considering not worrying about her reaction, but is it fair to do so? If the stepdaughter hasn't asked for help to move out, maybe the author's approach is justified. However, giving her a chance to find her own place with some support might be more considerate.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is about wanting their own space. That's valid, but they need to balance it with the stepdaughter's autonomy. Since she's an adult, she should be responsible for her own living arrangements. The author might be right in expecting her to leave since she's past 18 and working. But maybe the author should communicate clearly and set a timeline instead of being abrupt. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's about how they handle the situation. If they're not providing support and just evicting her without notice, that's problematic. But if they're giving her options and time, it's more reasonable. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering the information given, the answer would be B (No), because the stepdaughter is an adult and the author has the right to ask her to leave, especially if she's not contributing and is causing tension. However, the method might need to be respectful. The answer leans towards B.\n"
