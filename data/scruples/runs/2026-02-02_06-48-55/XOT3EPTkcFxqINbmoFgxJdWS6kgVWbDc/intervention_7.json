I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and has been living with the couple for years. The author's partner (fianc\u00e9) is okay with her staying, but the author wants her to leave. The author has tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially after buying a car for her 16th birthday, which she didn't acknowledge. They've given her time to move out but she hasn't, and now the author wants to push her out.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority over her. The couple doesn't have a legal marriage, so the author isn't a legal parent. So, kicking her out might require some legal steps if she refuses to leave. But the question is more about right and wrong, not legality.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author has provided support, but the stepdaughter is now capable of living independently. The author wants their own space with their partner. However, the stepdaughter might have expected continued support, especially if there were previous understandings. The author's approach is to just kick her out, not offering support or transition help. That could be seen as harsh. Also, the stepdaughter might not have a safety net elsewhere, which could be a problem.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid\u2014trying to build a relationship that wasn't reciprocated, wanting privacy. But the method of handling it is abrupt and without considering the stepdaughter's situation. The author's lack of concern for her reaction could lead to negative consequences, like homelessness for her. So, while the author has reasons, the approach might be unkind and not considerate of the stepdaughter's well-being. The fianc\u00e9's stance is also important; if she's supportive, that might affect the stepdaughter's options.\n\nIn summary, the author's motivations are understandable, but the method is questionable. They might be in the wrong for not providing support during the transition and acting unilaterally without considering the stepdaughter's needs.\n"
