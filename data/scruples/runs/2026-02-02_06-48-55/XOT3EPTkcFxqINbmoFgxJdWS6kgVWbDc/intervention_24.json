I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The scenario is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9e, who they're not married to, but live together. They have an adult stepdaughter who's 19, lives with them, works at a salon, and has been there since she turned 18 instead of going to school. The author feels they've tried to be kind but have a strained relationship, especially after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and being ignored. Now, the author wants her to move out.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: In the U.S., once someone turns 18, they're an adult, so the author doesn't have legal authority to force them out unless there's a lease or specific agreement. But since the stepdaughter is living with her mother, the fianc\u00e9e, maybe the lease is under her name. If that's the case, the author might not be the one responsible for the lease terms. So the author might not have the legal power to kick her out without the fianc\u00e9e's cooperation.\n\nEmotional aspect: The author mentions they've tried to improve the relationship but were met with indifference. The stepdaughter's behavior, like not acknowledging the car gift, might have contributed to the author's frustration. However, the author's approach seems harsh\u2014saying they don't care how she takes it. That could be seen as dismissive or lacking empathy.\n\nResponsibility: The author supports the stepdaughter financially, possibly contributing to her living expenses. If she's not moving out and has the means, maybe it's reasonable to expect her to leave. But considering the relationship dynamics, is it fair to force her out? The stepdaughter might feel pressured, especially if the mother (fianc\u00e9e) is in favor of her staying. It could create family conflict.\n\nAlternatives: Instead of kicking her out, maybe discussing expectations and setting boundaries could help. The author mentions talking to the fianc\u00e9e about her plans, but the fianc\u00e9e hasn't pushed for her to leave. Perhaps the author could set a timeline or conditions for her to stay, encouraging independence without being abrupt.\n\nEthical perspective: The author's desire for privacy and a home with their partner is valid. However, using a blunt approach without considering the stepdaughter's feelings or circumstances might be problematic. The stepdaughter might need time to find her own place, and the author's impatience could be seen as selfish.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a right to want their space, the method of handling it\u2014being indifferent to the stepdaughter's reaction and not collaborating with the fianc\u00e9e\u2014might place them in the wrong. The situation requires a balance between the author's needs and the stepdaughter's right to autonomy. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances, but the author's approach seems lacking in empathy and legal clarity.\n"
