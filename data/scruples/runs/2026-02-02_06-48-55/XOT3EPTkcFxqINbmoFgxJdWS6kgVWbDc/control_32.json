I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if it's wrong for the author to kick out their adult stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-term relationship, not married, but living as a married couple. They have a 19-year-old stepdaughter. The stepdaughter and author have a poor relationship; the author tried to improve it but didn't succeed. The stepdaughter is now working and saving money but chooses to stay in the house. The author wants her to leave to have the house to themselves and their fianc\u00e9e. The author isn't concerned about how the stepdaughter reacts, and the fianc\u00e9e might be upset but they think it's for the best.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: Since the stepdaughter is an adult (19), the author likely doesn't have legal authority over her. In most places, adult children can live with family as long as they want unless there's a lease or agreement. The author can't just kick her out without her consent or a legal process. Legally, the author might be in the wrong if they try to remove her without proper cause or if she's a tenant.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more complex. The stepdaughter is an adult and has the right to choose where she lives. The author's desire for privacy and a two-person household is understandable, but it's important to consider the stepdaughter's autonomy. If the stepdaughter is paying her way or contributing, that's different. But if she's staying for free, the author might feel it's unfair. However, using emotional manipulation or coercion to get her to leave would be unethical. The author should communicate their needs and perhaps set boundaries, but outright kicking her out without her agreement might be wrong.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude of not caring how the stepdaughter reacts could be seen as dismissive. Respect for others' autonomy is important. The author might need to have a conversation about moving out, maybe offering support, but can't force her if she doesn't want to leave.\n\nIn summary, legally and ethically, the author is likely in the wrong if they attempt to evict the stepdaughter without her consent or legal justification. The stepdaughter has a right to her own living arrangements as an adult.\n"
