I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, who's in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e (not married), wants to kick out his stepdaughter who's 19 and lives with them. The stepdaughter isn't really close to him, and he's tired of waiting for her to move out on her own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once someone turns 18, they're legally an adult, which means the parents or guardians don't have the authority to force them to move out. However, if the stepdaughter is living in the home but isn't the landlord, the author as the landlord (assuming he owns the house) might have the right to ask her to leave, provided there's a lease or some agreement. But if there's no formal agreement, it could get complicated. Legally, the author might have the right, but ethically?\n\nEthically, the author is in a position where he's not her parent. He's the partner of her mother. The mother (his fianc\u00e9e) is the one who's supposed to make decisions regarding her child's living situation. If the author is pressuring the mother to move out her own daughter, that's a red flag. The mother might feel torn between her partner's wishes and her daughter's needs. Also, the daughter is choosing to stay, which implies she's willing to contribute and save money. The author's main motivation seems to be wanting the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e, which is a personal desire but shouldn't override the daughter's autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship between the author and the stepdaughter. He mentions they never had a good relationship, but he's been kind. However, using the phrase \"I don't really care how she takes it\" shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. That's not just about the situation but about his attitude. Even if he's legally right, being dismissive of someone's emotional response can be ethically problematic.\n\nThe author also proposed with the understanding they wouldn't get married. That's a unique dynamic. But that doesn't give him authority over the daughter's living arrangements. The responsibility of the mother to support her adult child is a family matter. The author stepping in to make decisions about her future might overstep his role as a partner.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, maybe he can ask her to leave if he's the landlord, but ethically, he's overstepping by not respecting the mother-daughter relationship and the daughter's choice. He's also imposing his will without considering her autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
