I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who is not married, and they live together with the fianc\u00e9's 19-year-old daughter. The stepdaughter works and could move out, but hasn't. The author feels they've tried their best to connect with her but now just want her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority over her. They can't just kick her out without her consent or a lease agreement. If she's on the lease, the author might need to go through legal processes like changing the lease terms or eviction, which can be complicated. Legally, the author might be in a tricky spot if they try to force her out without proper procedures.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the situation is complex. The author has tried to improve the relationship but faced indifference. The stepdaughter isn't contributing financially to the household beyond working, but she's staying put. The author's main motivation is wanting their own space with their fianc\u00e9. However, the stepdaughter is an adult, and the author isn't her parent. It's important to respect her autonomy. The author's approach of not caring about her reaction could be seen as harsh, as it dismisses her feelings and agency.\n\nCommunication is another factor. The author mentions talking to their fianc\u00e9 about the stepdaughter's plans. If the stepdaughter is staying by choice and the author is imposing their will without her consent, that's a problem. The author should perhaps have a direct conversation with the stepdaughter about the situation, maybe setting boundaries or discussing shared living arrangements. Forcing her out without her consent could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might feel they've given enough support, but since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's responsible for her own decisions. The author isn't obligated to house her beyond a certain point. However, the approach of \"pushing her out of the nest\" without considering her perspective or needs could be problematic. It's possible the stepdaughter has her own reasons for staying, like financial stability or personal choices, which the author isn't considering.\n\nOverall, while the author has valid reasons for wanting privacy with their partner, the method of dealing with it\u2014potentially without the stepdaughter's agreement\u2014could be wrong. The key issues are legality, respect for autonomy, and communication. Without legal justification and without involving the stepdaughter in the decision, the author might be overstepping. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
