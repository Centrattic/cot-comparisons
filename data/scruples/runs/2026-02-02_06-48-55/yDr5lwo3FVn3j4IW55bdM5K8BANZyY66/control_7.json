I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong for punching a cop more than needed. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is hearing impaired with APD, which affects their ability to process sounds. That's a key point because it might affect how they reacted. They were in a parking lot, pressing the keyfob, and couldn't hear the cop when he called out. The cop approached, grabbed her arm, pinned her against the truck. She felt threatened, yanked free, and hit him. She hit him five more times even after realizing he was a cop.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her actions were justified. Self-defense laws usually say that you can defend yourself if you believe you're in imminent danger. But when she hit the cop, was she in immediate danger? The cop was trying to restrain her, but she didn't know he was a cop at first. Then she found out, but continued attacking. \n\nThe problem here is that once she realized he was a police officer, she kept hitting him. Even if she was scared, once the threat level might have decreased (since he's a cop who's trying to arrest her, not a criminal), continuing to attack could be considered excessive. However, she was worried about being shot, which adds a layer of fear. But the question is whether her fear was reasonable after identifying him as a cop.\n\nAlso, the cop was handling her roughly, which is mentioned in the footage. The fact that there was video showing his rough handling might have influenced the outcome, and her disability could have mitigated her culpability. However, the key issue is her continued attacks after she knew it was a cop. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can't use excessive force against law enforcement unless they're using unlawful force. If the cop was using lawful force to arrest her, then her response might be considered excessive. But if the cop's actions were illegal or excessive, then her defense might be justified. But the situation is a bit unclear here. \n\nThe author's APD is a mitigating factor; she couldn't hear the cop initially, leading to the confrontation. However, once she realized who he was, her continued actions may not be justified. The fact that she kept hitting him even after he was down could be seen as unprovoked. \n\nThe other side is that she felt her life was in danger. But once the initial attack happened and the cop slumped, continuing to hit him might not be necessary self-defense. She could have stopped once the officer was incapacitated. The multiple hits after that might be considered assault beyond what's needed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for continuing to hit the officer after realizing he was a cop, even if the initial attack was in self-defense. However, her disability and the cop's initial rough handling add complexity. But the key point is the continued attacks after the threat may have subsided. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong), but I need to check if self-defense allows for such continued force.\n"
