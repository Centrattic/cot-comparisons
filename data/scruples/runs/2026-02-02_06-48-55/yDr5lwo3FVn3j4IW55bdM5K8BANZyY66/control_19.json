I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who punched a cop multiple times and caused serious injuries. I need to determine if she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the circumstances. The author has an Auditory Processing Disorder, which makes it hard for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a poorly lit parking lot and didn't notice the officer. When she turned to check her truck, the officer saw her as a potential threat. The officer called out, but she didn't hear him due to APD and traffic noise. He then grabbed her, which she interpreted as an aggressive move, leading her to punch him in self-defense. She kept hitting him after the initial punch, causing more harm, fearing he might shoot her. The outcome was settled out of court, and there was footage showing the officer's rough handling.\n\nNow, legal and moral aspects. Legally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. She hit him multiple times after the initial punch, leading to severe injuries. Even if she felt threatened, continuing to hit him after he was down might be considered excessive. However, her state of fear and disability could be mitigating factors. Morally, she's conflicted about causing harm, especially since the officer later apologized. The fact that she called an ambulance shows she didn't want to harm him further after the fact.\n\nThe officer's actions were a factor here. If he grabbed her roughly, that could justify some level of self-defense. But the key point is the proportionality of her response. Self-defense laws vary, but generally, you can't use more force than necessary. Hitting someone multiple times when they're already subdued might cross that line.\n\nAlso, the outcome was settled out of court, possibly because the evidence showed the officer's rough handling. But the author still feels guilty about overreacting. The fact that she's hearing-impaired and misunderstood the situation complicates things. However, once she realized he was a cop and he was injured, continuing to hit him might have been unnecessary unless she still felt in imminent danger.\n\nOn one hand, her APD and the officer's initial aggression contributed to the situation. On the other, her continued attacks beyond the first punch could be seen as the wrong action. The answer hinges on whether her actions were proportionally self-defense or excessive. Given that she kept hitting after he was down, even if in fear of being shot, it might be considered overkill. However, given her disability and the context, some might argue it's understandable. But legally, the excess force could make her at fault. But the question is about being the asshole, not just legally wrong. So, morally, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but she did overdo it. The answer might be B (No), but there's a gray area. Alternatively, if the answer is A (Yes), because she used excessive force. Need to balance the factors.\n"
