I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated because it involves a person with a hearing disability and a police officer.\n\nFirst, the author has APD, which makes it hard for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot near a busy road, so there's a lot of traffic noise. She was walking back to her truck because she was worried about locking it. The officer saw her and thought she was running away, maybe suspecting her of doing something wrong. He called out that he was a cop, but she couldn't hear due to the noise and her disability.\n\nHe grabbed her arm and pinned her against her truck. She panicked, broke free, and punched him hard. She felt threatened and hit him five more times even after he was slumped against the tailgate. The result was serious injuries for the officer, including a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket. She called an ambulance and stayed until help arrived. The case was settled out of court, with footage showing the officer handled her roughly. The officer later apologized.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. She has a disability that affects her ability to process sounds, which is a mitigating factor. She was in a stressful situation, possibly facing a threat (being pinned by an officer), and her reaction could be self-defense. The officer's initial actions (grabbing her) might have been excessive, especially if she was just trying to check her truck. However, she continued hitting him after he was already incapacitated, which could be overkill. Even if she was scared, hitting someone multiple times after they're down might be excessive, regardless of the initial threat.\n\nLegally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is reasonable and proportional. If she believed her life was in danger, maybe the initial punch was justified. But hitting him five more times when he was already down might not be. Morally, causing serious injury beyond what's necessary for self-defense could be seen as the wrong thing to do. The author feels guilty about the extent of the injuries, which suggests she recognizes that maybe it wasn't necessary.\n\nAlso, the fact that the officer later apologized might indicate that his actions were inappropriate. However, the key issue is whether the author's response was proportionate. Fear and panic can lead people to overreact, but in terms of right and wrong, the excessive force might mean she's at fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, there's a balance between her disability, the officer's actions, and her over-the-top response. The answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because the continued hitting after he was down was unnecessary, even if the initial act was self-defense. But there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) because of her disability and the officer's rough handling. But given the outcome, maybe the answer is A.\n"
