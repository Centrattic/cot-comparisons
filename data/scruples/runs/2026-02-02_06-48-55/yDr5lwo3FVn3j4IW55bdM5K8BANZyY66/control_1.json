I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who ended up punching a police officer. Let's break down the facts.\n\nFirst, she has an auditory processing disorder, which makes it hard for her to understand speech, especially in noisy environments. That's a key point because it might explain why she didn't hear the officer when he called out to her. She was walking towards her truck to check if it was locked because she couldn't see the lights from where she was. The officer saw her turning away and thought she was running, which could lead to a misunderstanding.\n\nWhen the officer approached, he grabbed her arm and pinned her against her truck. She felt threatened, possibly because she assumed he might shoot her after she punched him. Her fear might be justified if she thought he was going to use lethal force. But when she hit him, she continued even after realizing he was a cop and he was injured. That seems like the moral conflict here\u2014she was afraid but kept hitting him, causing serious injury.\n\nNow, legally, self-defense usually allows for reasonable force to protect oneself. But continuing to hit someone after they are incapacitated or after the threat is neutralized might be considered excessive. She mentions she hit him five more times once he was slumped, which could be seen as unnecessary once he was down.\n\nHowever, there's a context of her disability. The fact that the police department might have handled the situation differently if she wasn't a \"tiny white lady\" points to possible systemic issues or bias. The video shows the officer handled her roughly, which could indicate that his actions were excessive, contributing to her fear.\n\nThe outcome was settled out of court, and the officer later apologized, which might suggest that his actions were at least partially to blame. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for hitting him more than necessary. Even if she had a legitimate reason to defend herself, continuing to hit him after he was injured could be seen as the wrong choice. She acknowledges she caused more harm than necessary and feels guilty about it.\n\nSo, balancing her fear and disability against the excessive force she used, it's a tough call. But since the question is about morality, and she admits she used more force than needed after the initial punch, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, she's in the wrong for continuing to hit him unnecessarily).\n"
