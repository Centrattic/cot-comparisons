I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman with a hearing impairment who had an encounter with a police officer in a parking lot. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author has APD, which affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was walking towards Walmart, pressed her keyfob but didn't see the truck's lights because she was too far. She turned back to check the lock, which the officer might have misinterpreted as running away. The officer called out and identified himself, but she didn't hear due to the traffic noise.\n\nHe grabbed her and pinned her against the truck. She felt terrified, fearing being shot, so she punched him. The key point here is the number of punches. She hit him once initially, then five more times even after realizing he was a cop and had already been injured. The officer sustained serious injuries, leading to memory issues and early retirement. The author later called an ambulance and stayed with him, but the question is whether continuing to hit him after he was already down was wrong.\n\nLegally, using force in self-defense is a factor. If she genuinely feared for her life, maybe initial strikes could be justified. But hitting a subdued officer multiple times might be excessive. Ethically, even if she was scared, knowing he was a cop and had already been injured, continuing to attack could be seen as unnecessary and escalating the violence. The fact that she kept hitting him because she thought he might pull his gun is a bit of a contradiction since he was already in a position where he could have accessed his weapon.\n\nAlso, the outcome was settled out of court, possibly due to the officer's rough handling and her disability, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of responsibility for the excessive force. The author's own admission of causing more damage than needed and feeling bad about it suggests moral conflict. \n\nSo, while her initial reaction might be understandable due to her condition and the situation, the continued assault after the officer was already incapacitated seems excessive. Therefore, the answer is A; she is in the wrong for using more force than necessary once the officer was subdued.\n"
