I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop multiple times. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author has a hearing impairment and APD, which makes it hard for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a poorly lit parking lot, trying to double-check her truck was locked. The officer probably saw her as a threat when she turned and jogged back. He called out, but she didn't hear him due to her condition and the traffic noise.\n\nWhen he approached and grabbed her, she felt terrified, thinking he might shoot her. She hit him once, but then continued hitting him after he was already slumped. She was in fight mode, but after realizing he was a cop, she kept going out of fear.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense and the use of excessive force. Self-defense laws generally allow the use of force if someone reasonably believes they're in danger. However, the force used must be proportional. \n\nIn this case, the officer was trying to restrain her, which is part of his duty. She hit him once, which could be seen as a reaction to being grabbed. But hitting him five more times after he was down might be seen as excessive. Even if she feared for her life, once he was incapacitated, continuing to hit him could cross into unnecessary violence.\n\nHer disability is a mitigating factor. It explains why she didn't hear the officer and reacted the way she did. However, the part where she continued to hit him after he was already injured might be problematic. The fact that she later called an ambulance and helped shows some remorse, but the initial escalation is the issue.\n\nThe police department handling her roughly is also a factor. If the officer used excessive force first, that could justify her reaction. However, once the threat of the officer pulling a gun was neutralized, her continued attacks might still be considered over the line.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, self-defense doesn't cover hitting someone after they're down. So, even if the initial force was justified, the subsequent hits might not be. The author's own moral conflict here is clear\u2014she acknowledges that she may have gone beyond what was necessary.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for continuing to hit the officer after he was already incapacitated, despite the initial justified self-defense. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
