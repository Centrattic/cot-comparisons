I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and auditory processing disorder ended up punching a cop multiple times. Here's what I know from the story:\n\nFirst, she has a disability that affects her ability to process sounds, making it hard to understand speech, especially in noisy environments. She was walking in a poorly lit parking lot, pressed her keyfob to check if her truck was locked. The fob didn't work because she was too far, so she turned back. The cop saw her turning and maybe thought she was running away. She didn't notice the cop because of the traffic noise. He approached, grabbed her arm, pinned her against the truck. She panicked, fearing the worst, so she punched him. Then, even after seeing he was a cop and he was injured, she hit him five more times. She ended up causing significant injuries.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. From her perspective, she has a disability that made it impossible to hear the cop. She was in a high-stress situation, in a dark parking lot, and when the officer grabbed her, she thought he might be a threat. Her actions were self-defense, at least initially. But then she continued hitting him after he was already injured. That part is tricky. If she realized he was a cop and he wasn't posing a threat anymore, hitting him more times could be excessive. However, she mentions she was scared he might pull a gun, so maybe she felt it was necessary. The outcome was that she was settled out of court, and the cop later apologized, but he had to retire. She feels bad about the damage.\n\nLegally, the key points would be self-defense. Depending on the jurisdiction, self-defense can be a valid reason for using force if you believe you're in danger. However, if the force used is excessive, then it might not hold up. The fact that she continued hitting him after he was injured and had slumped against the tailgate might be considered excessive. But considering her fear of being shot, maybe she felt it was necessary to incapacitate him further. However, once he was down and not attacking, continuing to hit him could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nHer disability is a mitigating factor. The officer's rough handling of her might have contributed to her fear. The video footage showed the officer was rough, which likely influenced the settlement. But from a moral standpoint, even if legally she's not convicted, she might feel guilty because she hit him more than necessary once she knew he was a cop. She acknowledges that she probably hit him more than needed and feels bad about it. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, maybe there's a case for self-defense, but morally, she might feel she could have stopped once the threat was neutralized. However, considering her disability and the circumstances where she misunderstood the situation, it's not entirely clear. The fact that the cop apologized might indicate that his actions contributed to the situation. \n\nBut the key issue is the five additional hits after he was already injured. If she believed he was still a threat, it's self-defense. But if he was incapacitated, then it's excessive. The author's reasoning was fear of being shot, which might be a valid fear in such a situation. But without more details on the officer's actions post-being hit, it's hard to say. Overall, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong given the circumstances and her disability, but there's a part where the additional hits could be seen as excessive. However, the fact that the situation was resolved out of court and the officer's apology suggests that the legal system might have considered mitigating factors. So, morally, maybe she's not the asshole. But I'm a bit conflicted. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. The answer could be B (No) because of her disability and the fear involved, but the over-hitting part is a problem. Hmm.\n"
