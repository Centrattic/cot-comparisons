I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in the situation described. The key points from the story are:\n\n1. The author is hearing impaired with APD, which makes understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments.\n2. They were in a Walmart parking lot, turned back towards their truck because they thought they hadn't locked it. The cop saw this and thought they were fleeing.\n3. The cop approached, called out that he was a cop, but due to the noise and the author's condition, they didn't hear him.\n4. The cop grabbed the author, leading to a confrontation where the author feared for their life and hit the cop multiple times, causing serious injury.\n5. The incident was resolved out of court, with the cop later apologizing. The author feels guilty about the injuries caused.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider self-defense laws and the circumstances. In many jurisdictions, using force in self-defense is justified if a person reasonably believes they are in danger. However, the proportionality of the force used is a key factor. If the threat level decreases, continued force might not be justified.\n\nThe author's actions were initially a reaction to being grabbed by the cop. They feared being shot, which is a serious concern. However, after the initial punch that knocked the cop down, they continued hitting him multiple times. The author mentions that even after seeing the cop was down, they hit him more. That could be seen as excessive force because once the threat (the cop pulling a gun) is neutralized, continued violence might not be justified.\n\nThe author's disability is a significant factor here. Their inability to process audio correctly, especially in a noisy environment, likely contributed to the misunderstanding. However, the fact that the cop had identified himself and was trying to stop them is also important. The author's fear leading to self-defense is understandable, but the extent of the injuries caused raises questions about whether the force was necessary beyond the initial confrontation.\n\nSince the cop apologized and the case was settled out of court, maybe there were mitigating factors like the cop's handling of the situation being rough. But the author's own admission of hitting more than necessary and continuing after the cop was down suggests they might have overreacted. However, given the fear of being shot, their actions could be seen as a panic response rather than premeditated.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral wrong, it's a gray area. Legally, if the force used was deemed excessive, the author could be at fault. Morally, the author's guilt over causing harm and the cop's apology might indicate a different perspective. But the question is about being in the wrong, not legal responsibility. The continued attacks after the cop was down might make the author at fault morally for not controlling their actions beyond self-defense. So leaning towards A, but need to consider all factors.\n"
