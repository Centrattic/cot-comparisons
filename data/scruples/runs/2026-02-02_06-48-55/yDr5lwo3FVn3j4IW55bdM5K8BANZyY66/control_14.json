I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairments and auditory processing disorder. The situation involves her being confronted by a police officer in a parking lot. \n\nFirst, she was walking back to check if she locked her truck. The officer saw her and thought she was fleeing, so he called out and then physically grabbed her. She didn't hear him because of her condition and the noisy environment. When she realized he was a cop after being grabbed, she hit him in self-defense. She continued hitting him even after seeing he was injured, out of fear he might shoot her.\n\nThe key points here are her disability affecting her ability to process sounds, the officer's use of force, and her subsequent actions. The question is whether her continued attacks after the officer was already injured make her the asshole.\n\nLegally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is proportionate to the threat. Initially, hitting the officer when he grabbed her could be considered self-defense. However, after he was already incapacitated or injured, continuing to hit him might cross into excessive force, especially since she acknowledges she hit him more than necessary. \n\nHer reasoning was fear of being shot, but once the officer was slumped against the truck, the immediate threat might have diminished. The fact that she called an ambulance and stayed to help shows some responsibility, but the initial question is about being in the wrong morally. \n\nHer APD is a mitigating factor, as it impaired her awareness. However, she did act in a way that caused significant injury beyond what might be strictly necessary. The APD and the officer's rough handling are on their side, but the excessive force she used after the initial attack could make her at least partially at fault. \n\nSo considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her continued attacks after the officer was injured were excessive, even if her initial actions were self-defense. Her fear is understandable, but the outcome suggests she went beyond what was necessary once the situation stabilized.\n"
