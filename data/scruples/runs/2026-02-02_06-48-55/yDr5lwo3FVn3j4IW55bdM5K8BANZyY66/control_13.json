I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's hearing impaired with APD, which makes understanding speech hard, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot, trying to check if she locked her car. The cop saw her and thought she was running away, but she didn't realize he was there because of the traffic noise.\n\nThe cop approached her, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against the truck. She panicked, broke free, and punched him, then hit him a few more times. The main question is whether she was wrong to hit him more times after the initial punch, causing serious injury.\n\nFirst, her disability is a key factor. If she couldn't understand the cop's commands because of her APD, maybe she didn't realize he was a cop. But once she saw him and realized, did she have a right to continue hitting him? She mentions she was terrified and in fight mode, fearing she might be shot. But after the first punch, when he was slumped against the tailgate, she kept hitting him. That part is morally conflicting for her. She says she knew he was a cop and had already injured him but continued out of fear.\n\nIn terms of self-defense, the initial response might be justified if she thought her life was in danger. However, once the cop was incapacitated, hitting him repeatedly could be excessive. The law usually requires that force used is proportionate to the threat. If the cop was subdued and not posing a threat, continuing to attack might be considered overkill.\n\nAlso, the outcome was settled out of court, with evidence showing the cop handled her roughly. Her disability likely played a role in the perception of the incident. The cop later apologized, which might indicate some fault on his part for using excessive force initially. However, the author's actions in continuing to hit him after he was already injured could be seen as unnecessary violence.\n\nOn the other hand, she was in a state of fear, possibly due to the cop's aggressive actions. Her APD might have contributed to her not realizing he was a cop, but once she did, she still chose to hit him multiple times. The line between self-defense and excessive force is blurry here. But legally and morally, using force beyond what's necessary to stop an immediate threat can be considered wrong. So the author might be in the wrong for continuing to hit him once he was already incapacitated.\n"
