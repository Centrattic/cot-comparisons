I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old woman with an auditory processing disorder, which makes understanding spoken language difficult, especially in noisy environments. She was in a poorly lit Walmart parking lot near a major road. She was going back to her truck to check if she locked it because the key fob didn't work from where she was. The officer saw her, and it looked like she was running away from him, so he called out he was a cop. Because of the noise and her APD, she didn't hear him. The officer approached, grabbed her arm, pinned her against her truck. She panicked, thought he might shoot her, and punched him in the temple. Then she hit him multiple more times, causing serious injuries. She later called an ambulance and stayed until help arrived. The case was settled out of court due to the officer's rough handling and her disability. The officer later apologized. The author feels guilty but is conflicted because she was scared of being shot.\n\nSo, the question is: is she in the wrong? Let's consider the legal and moral aspects.\n\nLegally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is reasonable and necessary to prevent imminent harm. In many jurisdictions, if a person reasonably believes they are in danger of death or serious injury, they can use force. However, if the threat is no longer present, continuing to attack might not be justified. Here, she was afraid of being shot. But once she hit him and he slumped, she kept hitting him. At that point, the threat might have been neutralized. Legally, using excessive force beyond what's needed to stop the threat could be a problem. However, her fear and panic due to her disability might affect how the law views her actions. The officer did use rough force, which could be a factor in self-defense claims.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author acted out of fear, but she did continue hitting after he was down. Even if she was scared, continuing to hit him when he was already incapacitated could be seen as excessive. However, she had a disability that impaired her ability to perceive the situation correctly. The officer's initial rough handling contributed to her fear. There's a balance between justified self-defense and overreaction.\n\nThe outcome was a settlement out of court, indicating maybe the legal system found some fault on the officer's side due to the footage. The officer apologized, which might suggest he acknowledged some wrongdoing in his approach. But the author's actions also caused significant harm. The key points are her disability's impact on her perception, the officer's use of force, and her proportionality in response.\n\nIn some places, the law might consider her disability a mitigating factor, making her response understandable. However, the repeated hits after he was down could still be seen as excessive unless she genuinely believed he was about to attack again. Given that she didn't know he was a cop initially and panicked, maybe her actions were justified initially. But continuing to hit after he was down is more questionable. But from her perspective, she feared he might retaliate with a gun. It's a tricky situation.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on legal definitions of reasonable force. Since the situation was settled without a court case, maybe the legal system didn't see her as clearly wrong. However, morally, the author might feel she overreacted, hence her asking if she's the asshole. The answer could be either legally not wrong, but morally maybe, but the options are A (yes) or B (no). The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the force was reasonable. If the law deemed her not the asshole, then B. But the user is asking for a moral judgment. Since the author is conflicted and the outcome was a settlement, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because there are mitigating factors. But others might argue she was in the wrong for excessive force. The answer is likely B since the officer was at fault and her disability is a factor. But I need to choose between A and B based on the analysis.\n"
