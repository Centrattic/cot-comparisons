I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation: she's hearing impaired with APD, which makes it hard for her to process sounds. She was in a parking lot, went back to check if she locked her truck, and a cop saw her and thought she was running from him. He approached, grabbed her arm, pinned her against her truck. She felt terrified, yanked free, and punched him. But then she hit him five more times even after seeing he was a cop and had already injured him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Her hearing impairment is a disability that affects her ability to process sounds, especially in a noisy environment. She didn't realize the cop was there until he grabbed her. That's a key point. When he grabbed her, she was in a stressful situation, possibly thinking he might shoot her because she hit him first. Her fear response makes sense given the circumstances\u2014being pinned by a cop in a poorly lit parking lot.\n\nBut then, after the initial punch, she continued to hit him even after she realized he was a cop. She knew she had already hurt him but kept going. She mentions she's opposed to violence outside of self-defense, so she recognized her actions went beyond that. The officer ended up with serious injuries, including brain damage and early retirement. The author feels guilty about the extent of the damage.\n\nLegally, the line between self-defense and excessive force is important here. If she was in immediate danger, the initial punch might be justified as self-defense. But continuing to hit him after he was slumped against the truck and she realized he was a cop could be seen as excessive. Even if she was still afraid of being shot, once he was incapacitated, continuing to attack might not be necessary. The fact that she called an ambulance afterward shows she did care about his well-being, which complicates things.\n\nMorally, the question is whether her actions were proportionate. She was in fear for her life, but once the immediate threat was neutralized (he was down), the additional punches might be considered unnecessary. She might not have been in immediate danger anymore, so the continued attacks could be seen as overkill. Plus, she had the chance to de-escalate the situation once she realized it was a cop.\n\nAlso, the fact that it was settled out of court might indicate that the police department had some fault too, given the footage showed rough handling and her disability. But the author's actions still resulted in serious harm to the officer. While her disability played a role in the initial misunderstanding, the excessive force after she knew the situation might still make her at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong for continuing to hit the officer after the initial justified self-defense. The author's guilt over causing more harm than necessary supports the idea that she knows she went too far. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
