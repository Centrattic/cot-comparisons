I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairments and APD, which affects how she processes sounds. She was in a parking lot, trying to double-check her truck's lock. She didn't notice a cop nearby. When she turned back towards her truck, the officer saw her and called out, but she didn't hear him because of the noise. He approached and grabbed her, leading her to panic and hit him. She hit him multiple times even after realizing he was a cop, fearing he might shoot her. The outcome was settled out of court, he apologized later, and she feels guilty about the harm caused.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, using force against law enforcement has specific rules. If someone uses excessive force against an officer, even if there's a misunderstanding, it can be considered a crime. But here, the officer used rough handling, which might factor into self-defense claims. The author's hearing impairment might affect her awareness, but she was in a public place where she should have been aware of surroundings. \n\nMorally, she acted out of fear. She had a valid reason to be scared\u2014officers can use lethal force if they feel threatened. However, hitting someone multiple times after they've been incapacitated (as he slumped against the tailgate) could be seen as excessive. She mentions she stopped after calling an ambulance, which shows some accountability. The fact that the officer later apologized might indicate some understanding of his role in the incident.\n\nThe key points are: her disability affected her perception, the officer's initial rough handling, her justified fear of being shot, and the subsequent overreaction in hitting him multiple times. The settlement and his apology suggest the legal system might have considered mitigating factors. However, using force beyond what's necessary to defend oneself, even against a cop who's acting aggressively, can be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, her disability and fear might be mitigating factors. On the other, hitting a cop multiple times when he's down crosses into unnecessary violence. The author herself acknowledges she hit more than needed, which shows self-awareness. So, the answer isn't clear-cut. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and considering she used excessive force despite her circumstances, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but with nuance. However, the officer's actions might have contributed, which complicates it. The user might be looking for a straightforward answer based on the provided details, so considering the excessive force after he was down, the answer is A.\n"
