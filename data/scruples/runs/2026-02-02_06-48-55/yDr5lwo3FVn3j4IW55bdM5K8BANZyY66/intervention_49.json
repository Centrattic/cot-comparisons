I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a woman with hearing issues punched a cop more than necessary. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and APD, which affects her ability to process sounds. That's a valid disability. She was walking in a parking lot, didn't notice the cop, and turned for a different reason. The cop chased her, grabbed her, and she punched him multiple times. She says she was scared he might shoot her, leading her to hit him repeatedly even after he was down.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, using force against police can be tricky. If an officer is acting within their duties, even if they're being rough, you can't just hit them. However, the officer's behavior might be in question if he used excessive force. The user mentions that there was footage showing the cop handling her roughly. So maybe he didn't act appropriately either.\n\nMoral conflict comes into play here. The author says she kept hitting him out of fear of being shot, but after he was already injured, continuing to hit him could be seen as unnecessary. Even if she felt threatened, once he was incapacitated, there might not be a legitimate threat anymore.\n\nThe fact that she called an ambulance and took care of him after suggests she didn't want to harm him, but the initial response was defensive. The outcome was settled out of court, which might indicate that both sides had some responsibility. The cop's rough handling and her disability likely played a role in the resolution.\n\nHowever, physically harming a law enforcement officer, regardless of the situation, is typically considered assault. Even if the cop was at fault, the appropriate response would be to try to comply and then report the misconduct. The woman's actions beyond the initial punch could be excessive, especially after the cop was already down.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions went beyond self-defense once the threat was neutralized. She continued hitting him despite him being injured, which might not be justified. Therefore, she might be in the wrong morally and legally.\n"
