I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after punching a cop. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has an auditory processing disorder (APD), which makes it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. They were in a parking lot and turned back toward their truck because they wanted to check if they locked it. The cop might have seen this as suspicious, so he approached them. The cop announced he was a cop, but the author didn't hear him due to the noise and their condition. Then the cop grabbed the author, which led to the author punching him multiple times.\n\nThe key points here are the author's disability and their reaction. The author was terrified and in fight mode, which is understandable given the situation. When someone grabs you in a dark parking lot, especially a cop who could have drawn their gun, it's natural to panic. The author's hearing impairment played a role in not recognizing the cop's presence or his verbal commands.\n\nBut then the author hit the cop five more times after the initial punch. They knew the cop was injured but kept hitting him. The argument here is whether continuing to attack after the threat (the cop grabbing them) is justified. Even if the author was scared, once the cop was subdued or injured, continuing to hit him might be excessive self-defense. The author did call an ambulance, which shows some responsibility, but the question is about whether using that much force was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the cop's rough handling could be a factor. The parking lot footage showed the cop was rough, and the author's disability might have contributed to the misunderstanding. On the other hand, causing a bad concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket seems excessive. Even if the author was in fear, once the initial threat was neutralized (like the cop being dazed), continuing to hit him might be considered overkill.\n\nThe author also mentions feeling bad about the damage and the cop's early retirement. That shows remorse, which is a point in their favor. However, the law typically looks at the reasonableness of force used. In many jurisdictions, self-defense allows for reasonable force to stop an imminent threat. If the cop was still a threat after the first punch, maybe the author's actions were justified. But once the cop slumped over, maybe the threat was over, making additional hits unnecessary.\n\nAnother angle: the author's fear of being shot. If they thought the cop might pull a gun, they might have acted out of perceived necessity. However, the law might not accept that if the threat was not ongoing. The cop had the right to use force if the author attacked, but the author's actions led to the cop being injured, which complicates things.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as justified initially due to their disability and the misunderstanding. However, continuing to hit the cop after the threat was neutralized could be seen as excessive. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) for the additional hits beyond what was necessary. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) if they believe the fear and disability justify it. However, the key is the continued assault after the threat was mitigated. So I think the answer is A.\n"
