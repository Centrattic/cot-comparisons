I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the person is hearing impaired and has APD. They were in a Walmart parking lot, went back to check if they locked their truck. A cop saw them and thought they were running away. The cop grabbed them, and the person, thinking the cop might shoot them, punched him several times, causing serious injuries. They ended up settling out of court because the footage showed the cop was rough, and the person's disability probably influenced the outcome.\n\nFirst, the author's defense is about their disability. They couldn't hear the cop when he announced himself because of the traffic noise and their APD. They didn't realize he was a cop until after the punch. Then, when the cop grabbed them, they panicked and hit him. The key here is whether their actions were justified as self-defense, especially considering their fear of being shot.\n\nIn self-defense situations, the person's perception of threat is important. Even if the threat wasn't real, if they genuinely believed they were in danger, that can be a factor. However, once the cop was subdued (he slumped after the first punch), the author continued to hit him five more times. That's the morally conflicting part they mention. They knew they had already injured him but kept hitting, maybe out of continued fear or panic. \n\nThe cop's actions might have been excessive (grabbing and pinning them), which could justify some level of self-defense. But the multiple punches leading to severe injuries, even after the initial attack, might cross into unnecessary violence. The author's own admission that they hit more than needed and feel bad about the outcome suggests guilt. Also, the fact that the case was settled out of court because of the cop's rough handling and the person's disability might indicate that the situation wasn't entirely the author's fault, but they still caused harm.\n\nLegally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the cop was trying to arrest them and the person used excessive force, that could be a problem. The author's fear of being shot is a big factor, but in reality, would a cop really shoot someone for punching them? Maybe, but the fear might have been real in the moment. However, after the initial punch, continuing to hit an officer could be seen as not necessary, especially once the threat level might have decreased.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions were in response to a perceived threat, influenced by their disability. However, the continued attacks after the cop was already down might be excessive. The author themselves feel conflicted and guilty, which leans toward them being in the wrong morally, even if legally they might have had some justification.\n"
