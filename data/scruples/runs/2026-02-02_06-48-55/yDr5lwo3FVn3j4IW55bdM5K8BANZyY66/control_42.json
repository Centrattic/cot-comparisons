I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let's start by going through the situation step by step. The user is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and auditory processing disorder. She was in a Walmart parking lot, walking away from her truck, then realized she needed to check if she locked it. She turned back, and there was a cop. The officer thought she was running away, called out, but she didn't hear him. He grabbed her, she panicked, punched him in the head, and kept hitting even after realizing it was a cop. Now, she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider self-defense laws. In most jurisdictions, self-defense is a valid justification for using force when someone uses unlawful force against you. The officer here used force by grabbing and pinning her against the truck. If she felt immediate harm, maybe she had the right to defend herself. However, the question is about whether she went beyond what was necessary. She hit him multiple times after he was already slumped, causing serious injuries. The key points here are the proportionality of the force used and whether her fear was reasonable given the situation.\n\nShe had a legitimate reason to be confused because of her hearing issues and the noisy environment. The officer's actions might have been aggressive, and she didn't realize he was a cop initially. But once she did realize and he was incapacitated, continuing to hit him could be seen as excessive. Even if she was afraid he might pull out a gun, once he was already down and not posing a threat, the continued force might not be justified. \n\nAlso, the officer's actions might have been excessive. Since there was footage showing his rough handling, it's possible he acted unprofessionally. The fact that he later apologized could indicate that his use of force was at least questionable. However, the author's continued attacks even after he was subdued might overstep self-defense boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the duty to stop using force once the threat is neutralized. If the officer was incapacitated, hitting him more times might not be necessary. However, if she genuinely believed he could recover and pose a threat again, maybe she thought it necessary at the moment. But given that he was already slumped against the truck, maybe that's stretching it.\n\nConsidering her disabilities, the legal system might take that into account, especially if her auditory issues contributed to her misunderstanding the situation. The fact that the case was settled out of court and the officer's apology might suggest that both sides had some blame. But the author's own admission of regret over the damage she caused shows moral conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The initial punch could be seen as self-defense, but the multiple hits after he was down might be excessive. The answer might hinge on whether the continued force was reasonable. If the threat was neutralized, then yes, she might be in the wrong. But if she genuinely believed he was still a threat, maybe not. However, given that he was already injured and not moving, it's more likely the continued hits were unnecessary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
