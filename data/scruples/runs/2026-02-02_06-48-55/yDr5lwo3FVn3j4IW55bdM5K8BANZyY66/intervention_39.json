I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person involved is a 24-year-old woman with a hearing impairment and Auditory Processing Disorder. She was in a Walmart parking lot, trying to go back to her truck because she wasn't sure she locked it. The cop saw her walking towards the store and then turning, which he interpreted as her trying to run away. The cop called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear him due to her condition and the noisy environment.\n\nWhen the cop approached and grabbed her, she reacted violently, hitting him multiple times. He ended up with serious injuries. She later called an ambulance and helped until they arrived. The case was settled out of court, and the cop apologized later.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider are self-defense and the proportionality of her response. She claims she was in fear for her life because the cop could have shot her after she hit him. However, once she realized he was a cop and he hadn't used a weapon yet, continuing to hit him multiple times might be excessive. Even if she felt threatened, using lethal force or causing severe injury beyond what's necessary to stop an immediate threat could be considered excessive. The fact that she kept hitting him after he was already incapacitated (he slumped against the tailgate) suggests that her response wasn't proportionate. Also, the cop had the right to detain her if he suspected her of a crime, but his use of force might have been rough, which the video showed. Her disability might affect her perception, but the law generally doesn't excuse excessive force in self-defense unless there's a reasonable belief of imminent harm. Since the cop didn't shoot her and she continued attacking after he was down, the author's actions might be deemed unreasonable. Therefore, she's likely in the wrong.\n"
