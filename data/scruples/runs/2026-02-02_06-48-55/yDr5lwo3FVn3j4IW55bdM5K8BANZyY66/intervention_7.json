I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a woman with hearing impairment and APD was in a parking lot. She was walking away from her truck, turned back because she wanted to check if she locked it. A cop saw her and thought she was running from him. He approached her, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against her truck. She then punched him multiple times, causing serious injuries. Now she's wondering if she was in the wrong for hitting him more than once after the initial punch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, self-defense laws allow the use of force if someone reasonably believes they are in danger. However, the force used must be proportional to the threat. The cop had grabbed her and pinned her, which could be considered a threat. But once she had hit him and he slumped, she kept hitting him five more times. That's where the line might be crossed. After the initial attack, if the threat was neutralized, continuing to hit him could be considered excessive force.\n\nAlso, the cop was in uniform and had identified himself. The woman had a disability that affects her hearing, which complicates things. She might not have heard him when he announced he was a cop. But once she saw he was a cop and realized he was trying to subdue her, her continued assault could be seen as not self-defense. Even if she was scared, the fear might be justified initially, but once the situation changed, she might have overreacted.\n\nThe aftermath shows that the cop apologized, and there was footage showing his rough handling. The woman did call an ambulance and helped him, which might indicate she didn't want to harm him beyond self-defense. However, the physical damage she caused was significant. The key point here is whether her continued attacks were necessary for self-defense. Once the officer was incapacitated, further violence might not be justified, especially if she recognized he was a law enforcement officer and he wasn't posing an immediate threat anymore.\n\nAnother angle is the societal context. The woman might distrust police due to past experiences or systemic issues, but that doesn't excuse excessive force. The fact that she's a woman and white might have influenced how the situation was handled, but legally and morally, the focus is on her actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: she had a legitimate reason to fear for her safety when the officer grabbed her. The first punch could be self-defense. But continuing to hit him multiple times after he was already down might be excessive, especially once she realized he was a cop and he wasn't actively threatening her anymore. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for continuing the assault beyond what was necessary to defend herself.\n"
