I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after punching a cop. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has hearing issues and APD. That's important because it might affect how she perceives her surroundings. She was walking in a parking lot, pressed her keyfob, didn't see the lights, and turned back. The cop saw her turning and thought she was running away. She didn't realize he was a cop, and the officer tried to grab her. She broke free, punched him, and then hit him multiple times even after he was down.\n\nNow, the key points here are: her disability contributing to misunderstanding, the cop's rough handling, and her response. She claims she hit him out of fear of being shot. But once he was down, she continued hitting him. \n\nLegally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the officer had already been subdued and wasn't an immediate threat, continuing to hit him might be excessive. Even if she was scared, once the officer was incapacitated, continuing the assault could be considered wrong. Also, the fact that there was surveillance footage showing the officer's rough handling might mitigate her actions, but she still went beyond what was necessary after he was down.\n\nEthically, she admits to being conflicted. She's aware that hitting someone more than needed is bad, even if she felt justified. The outcome was severe for the officer, leading to memory issues and early retirement. That's a lot of damage, so there's moral responsibility there.\n\nOn the other hand, her disability might have impaired her ability to process the situation quickly. She didn't know he was a cop initially, and his actions could have been perceived as a threat. However, once the threat was neutralized (he was down), continuing the attack crosses a line.\n\nSo, considering the proportionality of force and the aftermath, even with her disability and the officer's initial aggression, the continued attacks after he was injured seem excessive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
