I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman with a hearing impairment who punched a cop multiple times. \n\nFirst, the woman has APD, which makes understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments. She was in a parking lot, turned back towards her truck, and didn't notice the officer. The officer chased her, grabbed her, and pinned her against the truck. She then hit him, and continued to do so even after realizing he was a cop.\n\nThe key legal and moral considerations here are self-defense laws and the proportionality of force. In many jurisdictions, self-defense is justified when someone reasonably believes they are in imminent danger of harm. However, once the threat has been neutralized, continuing to use force might be considered excessive.\n\nThe woman feared being shot because the officer had the grounds to do so after being punched. However, after the officer was already injured, hitting him five more times could be viewed as going beyond what's necessary for self-defense. Even if she felt threatened, if the officer was incapacitated, continuing the attack could be seen as assault, not self-defense.\n\nMoral conflict arises because she caused significant injury, leading to the officer's early retirement. While her hearing impairment and the officer's rough handling are factors, the excessive force she used after the initial punch might be the point where she's in the wrong. The fact that she kept hitting him even after realizing he was a cop and had already hurt him suggests that her actions went beyond what was necessary, which would make her at fault.\n\nAlso, the outcome being settled out of court might be due to the officer's misconduct, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of responsibility for the excessive force. Legal settlements don't always equate to moral rightness. The private apology from the officer might be a personal gesture and doesn't negate the ethical issue of her actions.\n\nSo overall, even considering her disability and the circumstances, the continued attacks after the initial act of self-defense likely make her the one in the wrong.\n"
