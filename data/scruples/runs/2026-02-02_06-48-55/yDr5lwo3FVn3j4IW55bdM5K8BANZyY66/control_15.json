I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and APD, which makes it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. The incident happened in a poorly lit parking lot with a lot of traffic noise. She was walking back to her truck because she thought she didn't lock it. The cop saw her and thought she was running away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nShe didn't initially realize he was a cop because of the noise and her condition. When he grabbed her, she panicked and hit him. Her fear of being shot led her to hit him multiple times even after he was injured. The outcome was serious injuries to the officer, but the case was settled out of court, and he later apologized.\n\nNow, considering the legal and moral aspects. Legally, self-defense can be a factor if someone believes they're in imminent danger. However, once the officer was already subdued (he slumped after the first punch), continuing to hit him might not be justified. The author kept hitting him out of fear of being shot, but at that point, the threat might have been mitigated. The officer was in uniform and had identified himself, even if she didn't hear it due to her disability.\n\nMorally, the author feels conflicted and regrets the excessive force. She took steps afterward, like calling an ambulance. The officer's retirement due to injuries adds to the moral dilemma. While her hearing impairment explains the initial misunderstanding, the continued attacks might be seen as overkill. However, her fear of being shot adds complexity.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the use of force must be proportionate to the threat. If the officer was already incapacitated, the need for further force diminishes. The fact that she hit him five more times after he was down could be seen as excessive, even in self-defense. The officer's private apology might indicate he understood the context, but legally and ethically, the author might still be at fault for not stopping once the threat was neutralized.\n\nSo, balancing the fear and disability against the proportionality of the force used. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the continued attacks after the initial threat was addressed.\n"
