I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after punching a cop more than necessary. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has an auditory processing disorder, which makes it hard to hear and process sounds, especially in noisy environments. They were in a Walmart parking lot, trying to check if they locked their car. They turned around because they couldn't hear the car's lights flashing, not because they saw the cop. The cop probably thought they were running away, so he chased them. When he approached, the author didn't hear him identify himself as a cop because of the traffic noise. Then the cop grabbed them, pinned them against the truck, and the author, thinking they might be shot, punched the cop. They hit him multiple times even after realizing he was a cop and had already injured him. The outcome was that the cop had serious injuries, and the author feels conflicted about it.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author's disability affects their ability to hear, which is a mitigating factor. The cop used force that was possibly excessive (grabbing and pinning), which could have escalated the situation. The author's fear of being shot might be a legitimate self-defense instinct. However, after the initial punch, continuing to hit the cop even when he was already down and injured could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nSelf-defense laws usually allow for reasonable force to protect oneself. If the author believed they were in imminent danger of being shot or harmed, maybe the initial punch was justified. But hitting multiple times after the threat has been neutralized (like when the cop is slumped and the author can see he's incapacitated) might cross into excessive force. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author continued to hit the cop despite knowing he was a police officer could be a problem. Police officers have certain protections under the law, and using excessive force against them can lead to more severe charges. The author's own admission that they hit more than necessary and caused serious injury supports the idea that they went beyond what was needed for self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the cop's initial actions (grabbing and pinning) might have been aggressive, contributing to the author's fear. The author's disability could be a factor in the legal system's consideration of their actions. However, legally, the determination often hinges on whether the force used was proportionate to the threat perceived.\n\nSo, considering all this, while the author's situation is complex and their disability is a factor, the act of continuing to hit the officer after he was already down and injured could be seen as excessive. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong for using more force than necessary beyond the initial self-defense.\n"
