I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a woman with hearing impairments and auditory processing disorder who ended up punching a cop multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The woman had a legitimate reason for being in the parking lot\u2014checking her car. The officer saw her as a potential threat when she turned away and jogged back. She didn't realize he was a cop, which could be important. Her APD might have contributed to her not hearing him when he announced himself. \n\nWhen the officer grabbed her, she felt threatened, especially at night in a parking lot. Her reaction was to hit him, which led to serious injury. The user's question is whether she's in the wrong for continuing to hit him after the initial punch.\n\nLegally, self-defense is a factor. If she reasonably believed she was in danger, the initial strikes might be justified. However, continuing to hit him after he was already incapacitated (he slumped against the tailgate) could be seen as excessive. The key here is whether the threat was ongoing. If the officer wasn't a threat anymore, then further violence might be unwarranted.\n\nAlso, the outcome is that it was settled out of court, and the officer apologized. The woman was terrified and possibly in fight or flight mode. But even so, hitting someone multiple times after they're down might be considered overkill. The user's friend thinks she's in the wrong, which is a common perspective when considering proportionality of response.\n\nMoral perspective: She feels guilty and regrets causing harm. The officer retired early and has memory issues. Her intent was self-defense, but the result was severe injury. The question is whether her actions went beyond necessary self-defense. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, self-defense requires that the force used is proportionate to the threat. If the officer was not using a weapon and was just restraining her, then her response might be considered disproportionate. The fact that she continued to hit him even after he was down suggests that the threat might have been neutralized, but she kept attacking. That could be seen as the wrong choice.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because the continued attacks after the threat was neutralized could be excessive. However, there's the defense of her disability and reasonable fear. But the law often looks at the proportionality of the response. Her initial punch might be justified, but the five more hits after he was down might not be.\n"
