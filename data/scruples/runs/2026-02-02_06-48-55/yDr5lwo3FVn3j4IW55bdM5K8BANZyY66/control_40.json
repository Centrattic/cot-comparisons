I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who ended up punching a police officer multiple times. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman has an auditory processing disorder, which makes it hard for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a parking lot near a major road, so there was a lot of traffic noise. She was walking back to her truck to check if she locked it, and an officer saw her, thinking she was running away. The officer approached, grabbed her, and pinned her. She then hit him several times, causing significant injuries, and feels guilty about the extent of the damage.\n\nThe key points here are: her disability, the officer's use of force, her fear response, and the proportionality of her reaction. \n\nIn terms of legal issues, using force against a law enforcement officer can be a serious matter. Even if she was in fear, the law often requires that the force used is proportional to the threat perceived. If the officer was trying to restrain her, and she hit him multiple times after he was already subdued (since he slumped against the tailgate after the first punch), that might be seen as excessive. \n\nHowever, her disability could be a mitigating factor. If she couldn't hear the officer clearly, and the situation was confusing, that might affect how her actions are perceived. Also, the officer's rough handling of her might have contributed to her fear and reaction. The fact that there was video footage showing the officer's rough handling could support her side.\n\nMoral responsibility is different from legal. Even if the law might charge her with excessive force, morally, if she genuinely believed her life was in danger, others might be more sympathetic. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user is asking for an answer based on the scenario, not just the law.\n\nSo, the woman was in a high-stress situation, with limited situational awareness due to her disability. The officer approached her, and his actions might have seemed threatening. However, after she had already hit him and he was incapacitated, continuing to hit him five more times might cross into excessive force, even in self-defense. That part seems morally questionable because once the threat is neutralized (he slumped down), further violence isn't justified.\n\nTherefore, while the initial punch might be seen as a reaction to being grabbed, the multiple additional hits after he was already down could be considered in the wrong. Hence, the answer might lean towards A (she is in the wrong) for continuing to hit him beyond what was necessary.\n"
