I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that a woman with a hearing impairment punched a cop more than necessary, causing serious injury. The key points here are her disability, the cop's actions, and her response.\n\nFirst, she has an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which makes it hard for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She didn't notice the officer when she turned back towards her truck. The officer, perhaps mistaking her for someone fleeing, approached and grabbed her. She was in a parking lot at night, which adds to the tension.\n\nWhen the officer grabbed her, she yanked free and punched him. She was scared, thinking he might shoot her. Then, even after seeing he was a cop and he was hurt, she hit him five more times. She caused a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket. She called an ambulance, which is good, but the question is whether her actions were excessive.\n\nNow, the legal aspect. In many places, self-defense laws consider whether the force used was reasonable. The initial punch might be considered self-defense if she believed she was in danger. But hitting him multiple times after he was injured might cross into excessive force. Even if she felt threatened, once he was down, continuing to attack could be seen as not necessary for her protection. Plus, he was a law enforcement officer, so using force against them can have different legal implications.\n\nHer disability might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't exonerate her from using excessive force. The fact that she continued to hit him even after he was slumped against the tailgate suggests that her actions were beyond what's necessary. The officer later apologized, which might indicate he overreacted, but that doesn't justify her overreaction either.\n\nThe outcome was settled out of court, which might have involved some understanding of her disability, but the question is about moral wrongness. She herself is conflicted, acknowledging that she hit more than needed and regrets the harm. Morally, using force beyond self-defense can be considered wrong, even if legally she might have a defense. So the answer might be A (she is in the wrong) because she used excessive force after the threat might have been neutralized.\n"
