I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and APD, which affects how they process sounds. That's crucial because they explain that they didn't hear the officer when he announced he was a cop. The environment was a busy parking lot with a lot of traffic noise, making it even harder for her to hear. So, she didn't realize he was a police officer when he approached her.\n\nShe was returning to her truck because she was worried about locking it. The officer saw her movement and thought she was fleeing, which led him to grab her. The officer used force, pinning her against her truck. At that moment, she was in fear for her life, thinking he might shoot her, which triggered her fight-or-flight response. She pulled away and hit him. But here's the conflict: even after realizing he was a cop and he was injured, she hit him five more times, causing serious injuries like a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket.\n\nNow, considering self-defense laws, the key points are whether the force used was reasonable given the threat. Initially, when she hit him the first time, it might be justified if she believed it was necessary to protect herself. But continuing to hit him after he was already down and injured complicates things. Even if she was scared of being shot, once the officer was incapacitated, the threat might have diminished. However, she mentions that she feared he might pull his gun, so maybe she thought he was still a threat. But that's a bit unclear.\n\nAlso, the fact that she called an ambulance and stayed to help shows some level of responsibility. The officer's rough handling was captured on video, which likely contributed to the case being settled out of court. Plus, her disability might have been a factor in how the situation was perceived, as she's a small woman which might not have been taken as seriously.\n\nThe moral dilemma she's facing is about using excessive force even under fear. While her disability and the circumstances explain her actions, legally, using force beyond what's necessary to stop an imminent threat could be seen as wrong. But given her impairments and the officer's initial use of force, there's a strong argument for self-defense. However, the multiple hits after he was down might be seen as excessive, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, self-defense allows for reasonable force to stop an attack. If the officer was using non-lethal force, lethal force in response might not be justified. Also, if the threat is neutralized (officer incapacitated), continuing to attack could be considered excessive. However, if there was a belief that the officer was still a threat (e.g., reaching for a gun), then it might be justified. The details here are a bit murky.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of the initial self-defense, but the continued attacks after the officer was down could be seen as excessive. However, given her hearing impairment and the chaotic situation, it's possible that her perception of the threat was genuine. The fact that she stopped to help after and the case was settled privately suggests there's some legal leniency here. Legally, it's a tricky case, but morally, she's struggling with guilt over the injuries caused. So, the answer might hinge on whether the continued force was necessary or excessive given the circumstances.\n"
