I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 24-year-old woman with auditory processing disorder, who punched a police officer multiple times after being grabbed in a parking lot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author has a disability that affects her hearing and processing sounds, which is similar to the Speech Jammer app example she gave. She was in a parking lot, pressed her keyfob to lock the truck but didn't see the lights because she was too far away. She decided to go back to check, which the officer might have misinterpreted as running away. The officer chased her, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against the truck. She then hit him, resulting in significant injury.\n\nNow, the legal and moral aspects. In many jurisdictions, using force against a police officer is a serious matter. Even if there's a disability, the level of force used can be a factor. The author hit the officer five times after the initial punch, causing a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket. She called an ambulance, so she did take responsibility for his injuries. The officer later apologized, and the case was settled out of court. The video shows the officer handling her roughly, which might have contributed to the settlement.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, even if she was acting in self-defense, using excessive force can negate that defense. The officer had a duty to enforce the law, and if he was doing so lawfully (e.g., trying to detain her for suspicion of a crime), then using force to resist could be considered assault. However, if the officer used excessive force initially, that might affect the legal outcome. The officer's lawyer mentioned he announced he was a cop, but the author couldn't hear due to her disability.\n\nMoral considerations include her intention. She felt terrified and in fight-or-flight mode, possibly fearing for her life. Her disability contributed to the misunderstanding. However, after the initial punch, she hit him multiple times, which might be seen as unnecessary once she realized he was a cop. She mentions she's against violence except in self-defense, but she kept hitting him out of fear he might shoot her. The result is that the officer retired early and has memory issues, which she feels bad about.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user wants a simple answer. So, considering the legal aspects, even if there was a misunderstanding, causing such severe injuries could be seen as excessive. But the officer's rough handling might have justified her self-defense. The key is whether the force was reasonable. Since she continued hitting him after he was down, that might be considered overkill. However, she was in a panic and feared for her safety. The fact that she's disabled and the officer's department might have a bad settlement because of her disability plays a role in the outcome.\n\nIn some cases, individuals with disabilities might have protections, but the use of force is still weighed. The officer was trying to detain her, and she took it to a level causing serious harm. Even if the officer had used excessive force, her response might still be seen as excessive if she kept going after he was incapacitated. So, morally, she feels conflicted and responsible, but the context of her disability and the officer's actions complicates it. The answer might depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction, but since the case was settled without public court, maybe the system took her disability into account. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just legal consequences. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a complex context with disabilities and police conduct, the author did cause severe injuries after an initial act of self-defense. The continued attacks might be seen as unnecessary, so she could be considered at fault. But maybe not, if her fear was justified. It's a tough call, but the fact that the officer apologized and the case was settled might suggest that the officer was at least partially at fault. However, the author's actions leading to serious harm could still mean she's in the wrong. I think the answer is A (Yes), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe B (No) because of the disability and the officer's conduct. The user probably wants a nuanced answer, but since the options are binary, I have to pick based on the balance of rights and wrongs.\n"
