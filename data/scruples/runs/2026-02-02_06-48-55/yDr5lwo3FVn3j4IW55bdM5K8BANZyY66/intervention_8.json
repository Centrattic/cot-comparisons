I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing when they punched a cop multiple times. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has an auditory processing disorder, which makes hearing and understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments. That's a key point because it affected their ability to perceive the officer's presence and commands. The officer saw the woman walking towards her truck, then she turned and ran back, which he might have misinterpreted as fleeing from the police. \n\nThe officer called out that he was a cop, but because of the traffic noise and her APD, she didn't hear him. When he approached and grabbed her arm, she felt pinned and panicked, leading her to punch him. Then, after the initial punch, she hit him five more times, even after realizing he was a cop and he was hurt. \n\nNow, considering the legal aspects: In many places, using force against law enforcement can be tricky. If an officer is doing their job and you resist, that's usually against the law. But there's also the defense of self-defense if you genuinely believe you're in danger. The question is whether her continued attacks were necessary once she realized he was a cop and he wasn't trying to shoot her or something. \n\nShe mentions she was in fight mode and feared being shot, but after the initial punch, she kept hitting him even when he was slumped against the tailgate. So, maybe she overreacted once the threat level decreased. The fact that she called an ambulance and took care of his neck until help arrived shows some responsibility, but the excessive force part is a problem. \n\nAlso, the outcome was settled out of court, possibly because evidence showed the officer used excessive force. But the author's actions caused serious injury. Even if she had a valid reason to defend herself initially, hitting a downed officer multiple times might cross the line into unnecessary violence. \n\nHer APD is a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the excessive force. The key here is whether the continued attacks were necessary. If she believed he was going to shoot her, but once he was down and not threatening, hitting him more wasn't justified. \n\nSo, while her initial reaction might be understandable given her fear and disability, the subsequent actions (hitting five more times after he was incapacitated) seem excessive. Therefore, she's probably in the wrong for the continued violence even if the first punch was self-defense.\n"
