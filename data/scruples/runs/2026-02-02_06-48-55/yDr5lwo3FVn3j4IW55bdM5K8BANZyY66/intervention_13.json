I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and APD. She was in a parking lot, turned back towards her truck because she thought she left it unlocked. A cop saw her and thought she was running from him. He tried to stop her, she hit him, then kept hitting after the initial punch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, using force against a police officer is a serious offense, even if in self-defense. The author hit the cop multiple times even after realizing he was an officer. The key here is whether her actions were justified as self-defense. She claims she was in fear of being shot, so she hit him. But once the initial threat (the cop grabbing her) was addressed, continuing to hit him multiple times might be considered excessive. \n\nShe mentions she hit him five more times after the first punch. Even if she was scared, once he slumped against the tailgate, continuing to hit him could be seen as unnecessary violence. Also, she's a hearing-impaired individual which might have contributed to the misunderstanding, but the law might not excuse excessive force. \n\nThe fact that she called an ambulance and stayed to help is a mitigating factor, but the question is about moral wrongdoing. The author herself feels conflicted about the damage caused, indicating some guilt. The cop later apologized, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of wrongdoing. \n\nLegally and morally, using force beyond what's necessary to defend oneself can be problematic. Even if the initial action was in self-defense, continuing to hit the officer once he was incapacitated might be seen as aggression rather than defense. So, while her situation is understandable given her disability and the circumstances, the excessive force used after the initial defense could place her in the wrong. \n\nThe answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the continued attacks after the initial threat was handled, regardless of fear. However, there's a gray area due to her disability and the cop's initial rough handling. But the law typically requires proportionality in force, and hitting someone multiple times after they're down might not meet that standard.\n"
