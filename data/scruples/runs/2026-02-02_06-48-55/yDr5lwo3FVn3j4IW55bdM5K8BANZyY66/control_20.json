I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's hearing impaired with APD, which affects her ability to process sounds. She was in a parking lot, pressing the keyfob for her truck, didn't hear the cop approaching. She turned back because she thought she hadn't locked the truck, which the cop might have misinterpreted as her running away. The cop approached, grabbed her arm, pinned her against the truck, and she panicked, punching him hard multiple times. She ends up causing serious injury, but there's surveillance footage that shows the cop handled her roughly. The case was settled out of court, and the cop later apologized.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's the asshole for continuing to hit him after the initial punch. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, self-defense. In many jurisdictions, you can defend yourself if you reasonably believe you're in danger. But here, the cop was trying to arrest her, perhaps. She didn't know he was a cop at first, which complicates things. Once she realized he was a cop, she hit him multiple times. The key point here is whether she had a reasonable belief that she was in immediate danger of serious harm or death, which would justify self-defense.\n\nShe mentions she was terrified and thought he might shoot her. However, the police officer was just trying to detain her, and even though he grabbed her roughly, does that escalate to a situation where she would be in danger of being shot? That's a bit unclear. Also, after the initial punch, he slumped against the tailgate. She kept hitting him even after he was down. That might be excessive force, especially once he's incapacitated. Even if she was in self-defense mode, continuing to attack when the threat is neutralized could be considered overkill.\n\nAlso, she has a disability that affects her hearing, which might be a mitigating factor. The court case was settled out of public court, and the footage showed the officer's rough handling. So there's some evidence that the officer used excessive force. However, even if that's the case, when a law enforcement officer is involved, the use of force by a civilian against an officer could be seen as more severe. Attacking a police officer is a serious matter, and even if the officer was using excessive force, the woman's response might have been disproportionate.\n\nAnother angle is the fact that she didn't stop after the initial punch. She hit him five more times. That could be seen as premeditated or as overreacting once the threat was neutralized. She mentions she was in fight mode and feared being shot, but once the officer was down, was there a continued threat? If not, then continuing to hit him would be excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, her disability and the auditory issues could be part of the context. She might not have processed the situation correctly, leading to a heightened fear response. Also, the settlement and the officer's later apology suggest that there was some fault on the officer's part, which might mitigate her responsibility.\n\nBut the core issue is whether her response was reasonable. Even if the officer was using excessive force, her response of punching him multiple times leading to serious injury might be seen as beyond self-defense. In some jurisdictions, the use of force must be proportionate. Since she was a civilian, and even if the officer was at fault, attacking him with such force could result in criminal liability.\n\nSo considering all that, while there's context of her disability and the officer's conduct, the fact that she continued to hit him after he was down might mean she used excessive force. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for continuing to hit him beyond the initial act of self-defense.\n"
