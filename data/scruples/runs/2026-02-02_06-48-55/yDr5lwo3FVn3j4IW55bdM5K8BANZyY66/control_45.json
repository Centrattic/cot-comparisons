I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman with a hearing impairment who ended up punching a cop. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She has APD, which affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a parking lot near a busy road, which added to the traffic noise. She didn't hear the cop when he called out because of her condition and the environment.\n\nShe was walking back to her truck after pressing the keyfob, not realizing she was out of range. The cop saw her, thought she was running away, and approached her. When he grabbed her and pinned her against her truck, she reacted violently, fearing for her life because she didn't know he was a cop. She hit him multiple times, causing serious injuries. \n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense versus excessive force. She was terrified and in a state of fear, which can justify self-defense. However, after the initial punch, she continued hitting him even after realizing he was a cop. That's the morally conflicting part. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the officer's behavior. The cop grabbed her roughly, which the parking lot footage showed. Since she's disabled and the situation was captured on camera, that might have influenced the outcome. The cop later apologized, which suggests there was some fault on his part in handling the situation.\n\nThe question is whether her force was reasonable. In self-defense cases, the force used should be proportional to the threat. She feared for her life, possibly leading to her hitting him again. However, after the initial strike, continuing to hit a stunned officer could be seen as excessive, especially once she realized he was a cop and he wasn't actively threatening her anymore.\n\nBut her hearing impairment and the circumstances (noisy environment, fear of being shot) are mitigating factors. The law often considers the defendant's mental state and circumstances. She might have a valid defense of herself, but the continued attacks after the initial threat could still be seen as overkill.\n\nOn the other hand, the cop's rough handling contributed to the situation. The fact that the case was settled out of court and the cop apologized indicates that both parties had some responsibility. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, she felt remorse and took responsibility by calling an ambulance. The fact that she's struggling with guilt over causing serious injury shows she acknowledges the harm. But legally, it's a different matter. Morally, if she didn't know he was a cop and was in fear, her actions could be seen as self-defense. However, continuing to hit him after he was incapacitated might be seen as unnecessary. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the force she used was necessary. Since she had already incapacitated him with the first punch and then hit him multiple times, that's where the issue lies. But considering her disability and the fear of being shot, it's a gray area. The cop's initial aggression also plays a role. \n\nIn the end, while her actions were a reaction to fear and her disability, the fact that she continued to hit him after he was down might make her partially at fault. However, given the circumstances and her condition, some might argue she wasn't entirely in the wrong. The cop's behavior also contributed. The user is asking if she is the asshole for continuing to hit him. Given that, and the fact that she caused serious injury beyond what was necessary once he was subdued, the answer could be A: Yes. But others might argue B: No, considering her fear and disability. However, the law often looks at proportionality, and hitting someone repeatedly after they're down is typically considered excessive. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
