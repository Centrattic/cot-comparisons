I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman with a hearing impairment (APD) who punched a police officer during an encounter in a parking lot. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The woman didn't notice the officer at first because of her hearing issues and the noisy environment. She turned back to check her truck's locks, which the officer might have misinterpreted as her running away. The officer approached, and she felt threatened, leading her to punch him. Even after the initial punch, she hit him multiple more times, causing significant injuries. She later called an ambulance and supported his neck.\n\nNow, the key points here are: her disability, the officer's actions, her fear response, and the use of excessive force. Let's start by looking at the officer's conduct. He grabbed her by the arm and pinned her against the truck. If the footage shows that he handled her roughly, that's important. Was his use of force justified? If he was acting in an aggressive or threatening manner, that could be a factor. \n\nThe woman had a legitimate reason for not hearing the officer, given her APD and the traffic noise. Her instinct to flee might have stemmed from fear, especially in a dark parking lot. But when the officer grabbed her, she used force to get free. The question is whether that force was excessive. The initial punch might be seen as a reaction to being grabbed, but hitting him five more times after he slumped against the tailgate? At that point, the officer was likely incapacitated, so continuing to hit him could be considered unnecessary. \n\nAlso, she mentions she's opposed to violence outside of self-defense. Self-defense typically allows for reasonable force to protect oneself. If the officer had the potential to shoot her after she punched him, she might have felt immediate danger, but once he was down, the threat might not have been ongoing. Hitting him multiple times in that scenario could cross into assault, regardless of the initial provocation.\n\nThe officer later apologized privately, and the case was settled out of court. The fact that the officer was at fault (rough handling) and her disability were factors. However, the outcome doesn't necessarily absolve her of wrongdoing. The law and moral judgment might differ. Legally, if she used more force than necessary after the threat had subsided, that's a problem. Morally, her fear and disability might be considered, but causing long-term harm (memory issues, early retirement) is serious. \n\nThere's also the aspect of perception versus reality. The officer might have thought she was fleeing, but she was actually going back to check her truck. Her explanation is reasonable, but the officer's actions led to the escalation. She had the right to defend herself from a perceived threat, but the after-the-fact additional punches seem excessive. \n\nSo, the dilemma is whether the continued attacks after the initial punch were necessary. If she believed the officer was still a threat after he was down, maybe it's justified, but if the threat was neutralized, then it's overkill. Her own admission that she hit him five more times even after seeing he was a cop and injured suggests that she might have gone beyond self-defense. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, self-defense only justifies using force that's necessary to prevent imminent harm. If the officer was subdued, continuing to hit him could be considered assault. The fact that she called an ambulance afterward shows some remorse and responsibility, but the initial overreaction and the number of strikes might still be on her. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the continued use of force after the officer was incapacitated may not be justified, even if she felt threatened initially. The initial punch could be seen as a reaction, but the five more hits are where the excessive force came into play. Her disability is a mitigating factor, but doesn't excuse the unnecessary violence after the threat was neutralized.\n"
