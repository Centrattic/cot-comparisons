I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. The person is hearing impaired with APD, which makes understanding speech hard, especially in noisy environments. She was in a parking lot, turned back towards her truck because she thought she didn't lock it, didn't notice the cop. The cop approached her, grabbed her arm, and she hit him multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, using force against a police officer can be a serious offense, even if it's in self-defense. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable under the circumstances. She had APD, which might affect her perception of the situation. However, once she realized he was a cop and had already hit him once, continuing to hit him multiple times leading to serious injuries might cross the line from self-defense to excessive force. \n\nSelf-defense usually allows for reasonable force to prevent immediate harm. If she felt her life was in danger, she might argue that, but the cop was just grabbing her arm and wasn't armed. The fact that she kept hitting him after he was down could indicate that the force wasn't necessary. Also, she had the chance to stop and realized he was a cop but continued, which could imply intent beyond self-defense.\n\nThe legal settlement out of court and the cop's private apology might suggest that there was some understanding of her situation, but legally, the actions could still be seen as excessive. Morally, she's conflicted about causing harm, even if she felt threatened. The societal context of police interactions and disability could also play a role, but legally, the standard is about reasonableness and necessity of force.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer likely is A (the author is in the wrong) because the continued hitting after the initial attack was probably unnecessary and excessive, even if the first punch was a reaction to being grabbed. The fact that she kept hitting after the officer was already injured and after she recognized he was a cop might mean she went beyond self-defense.\n"
