I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who ends up punching a cop multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author has APD, making it hard for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a dimly lit parking lot, pressing her keyfob to lock her truck. When she didn't get the expected response, she turned back towards her truck, not noticing the officer. The cop approached, called out, but she didn't hear him. He grabbed her, and she reacted with force, fearing for her life. She hit him multiple times even after he was down.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, self-defense usually requires that the force used is reasonable and necessary. The key is whether her response was proportionate to the threat. The officer had a right to approach her if he suspected foul play, but his use of force (grabbing and pinning her) might have been excessive. However, even if he was using excessive force, hitting him multiple times after he was incapacitated could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nMoral considerations: She was in fear for her life due to her hearing impairment and the situation. But after he was already down, continuing to hit him might cross into excessive violence. Also, the fact that she caused severe injuries (concussion, broken nose, fractured eye socket) might weigh against her. However, her disabilities and the context of the police department's handling (since the footage showed rough handling and her disability made it worse) might mitigate some blame.\n\nThe officer later apologized, and the case was settled out of court. This suggests that maybe both parties had actions that contributed to the situation. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. She was scared, but continuing to hit someone who was already injured could be seen as overstepping. On the other hand, her fear of being shot and her disability complicates the picture.\n\nSo, is she the asshole? The community might split. Some might say she acted in self-defense, others might argue she went too far. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, considering she used excessive force beyond what was necessary once the officer was down, the answer might lean towards A (Yes). However, her disability and the officer's initial aggression might make it a nuanced No (B). But the fact that she kept hitting him after he was incapacitated is a strong point towards her being in the wrong.\n"
