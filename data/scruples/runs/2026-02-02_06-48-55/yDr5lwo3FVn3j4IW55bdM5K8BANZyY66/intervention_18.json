I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a hearing-impaired woman who misunderstood a police officer's approach, leading to a confrontation where she punched him multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, using force against a police officer can be a serious offense, especially if they're performing their duties. Even if there was fear involved, excessive force might not be justified. The officer was trying to detain her after she ran away, which he might have perceived as resisting arrest. If she punched him after he had him subdued, that's different, but the situation here is that he grabbed her, leading her to react.\n\nMoral considerations are tricky. The author mentions feeling terrified and in fight mode, which might explain the initial punch. But she continued hitting him even after realizing he was a cop and had injured him. That seems like overkill if self-defense is the rationale. Self-defense usually requires that the force used is proportional and necessary to prevent harm. If she had already injured him and could have stopped, continuing to hit him might be excessive.\n\nAlso, the fact that she apologized later and called an ambulance might mitigate some blame, but the key point is whether her actions crossed a line. The officer ended up with serious injuries, and she admits she hit him more than needed. The settlement out of court suggests there were mitigating factors, like the officer's rough handling, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility for the additional hits.\n\nConsidering the auditory processing disorder, that's a factor in her perception and reaction. However, even with that, once she realized it was a cop and he wasn't posing an immediate threat beyond being a cop, continuing to hit him would be morally wrong. The answer hinges on whether her reaction was proportionate and necessary. The initial punch might be understandable in fear, but the follow-up hits are questionable.\n\nSo, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because after the first punch, continuing to attack caused unnecessary harm. Even in fear, once the threat level changes, the response should adjust. The officer wasn't trying to shoot her once he had her, and she could have stopped after the first punch. The subsequent hits were excessive.\n"
