I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a hearing-impaired woman who punched a cop multiple times after being grabbed by him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, the use of force is allowed in self-defense if someone is in immediate danger. But the question is about whether she went beyond what was necessary. She hit the officer after he had already been injured, and even though she called an ambulance, the fact that she hit him multiple times might be a problem. \n\nThe author mentions that she had APD, which makes it hard for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. The officer approached her and grabbed her, which she might have perceived as a threat. She thought he might shoot her if she hit him, so she fought back. But after the initial punch, when she realized he was a cop and he was down, hitting him five more times could be seen as excessive. \n\nLegally, self-defense usually stops when the threat is no longer present. If the officer was subdued and not posing an immediate threat, continuing to hit him might not be justified. Also, the outcome was settled out of court, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of moral responsibility. \n\nMoral conflict is mentioned by the author herself. She feels bad about causing more harm than needed. The officer retired early with memory issues, which adds to her guilt. She had disabilities that might affect how the situation was perceived, but that doesn't automatically excuse excessive force. \n\nOn the other hand, the officer's actions\u2014grabbing her and pinning her against the truck\u2014could be seen as aggressive and possibly inappropriate, especially in a poorly lit parking lot. The fact that there was footage showing rough handling might support her side. However, even if he was using excessive force, once he was incapacitated, her continued attacks might be overkill.\n\nThe key here is the proportionality of her response. Initial punch might be self-defense, but five more hits after he was down might not be. So, legally and morally, she might be in the wrong for continuing to hit him after the threat was neutralized. But the situation is complex due to her disability and the officer's initial actions. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong, and the answer hinges on whether her continued actions were necessary. Given that she stopped to call an ambulance, maybe she realized her mistake after, but the fact remains that she hit him more than needed once he was down. So leaning towards A (yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
