I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a 24-year-old woman with a hearing impairment and APD. She was in a Walmart parking lot, trying to check if her car was locked. She didn't notice a cop nearby and turned back toward her truck, which the cop saw as fleeing. He approached, grabbed her, and pinned her against her truck. She panicked, broke free, and punched him multiple times, causing serious injury. The officer later apologized, and the case was settled out of court.\n\nNow, legal and moral aspects. Legally, using force against a police officer can be complicated. In many jurisdictions, you can't use force against an officer even if they're acting aggressively unless you believe there's an immediate threat to your life. The user claims she feared being shot, which might justify self-defense, but hitting him multiple times after he was already injured might cross into excessive force. The officer was doing his job, even if his approach was rough. The fact that there was footage showing the officer's rough handling might support her side, but the key is whether her response was proportionate.\n\nMorally, she has a disability that contributed to the misunderstanding. She was scared and in fight-or-flight mode. However, after the initial punch, she continued hitting him when he was already slumped, which could be seen as overkill. She later called an ambulance and helped, which shows some responsibility, but the initial escalation is questionable.\n\nThe officer's actions were part of his duty, even if he might have been too rough. The user's APD is a mitigating factor, but it doesn't nullify the use of force against a police officer, regardless of the circumstance. In many places, using force against a law enforcement officer is a felony, even in self-defense, unless the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious harm. Since the officer was subdued after the first punch, the subsequent hits might be considered unnecessary.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be legally problematic. Morally, her intent was self-defense, but the continued attacks could make her at fault. The fact that she had a disability and the situation was a misunderstanding might mitigate some blame, but the escalation beyond self-defense is a key point. The answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because the continued violence after the officer was down could be seen as excessive, even if the initial punch was self-defense.\n"
