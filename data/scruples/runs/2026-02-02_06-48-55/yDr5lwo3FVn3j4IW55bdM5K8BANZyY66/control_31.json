I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person involved is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairments and APD. She was in a Walmart parking lot, which is poorly lit. She turned to check her truck after realizing her keyfob didn't work from a distance. An officer saw this and thought she was running away, possibly fleeing. He approached her, grabbed her arm, pinned her against her truck. She didn't realize he was a cop because of the environment and her hearing issues. She panicked, broke free, and punched him hard, then hit him five more times when she realized he was a cop, fearing he might pull a gun.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense and the use of excessive force. She had a legitimate fear because the officer was handling her roughly in a dark parking lot. However, even if she felt threatened, hitting him multiple times after he was already injured could be considered excessive. The law usually allows self-defense when there's an imminent threat of harm. But once the officer was subdued or the threat was neutralized, continuing to attack could cross into the wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that there was footage showing the officer's rough handling might have impacted the legal outcome. The officer later apologized, which might suggest his actions were inappropriate. But the question is about moral wrongdoing. The user is conflicted because she hurt a cop, which is a sensitive issue, especially since she's a small woman. However, her disabilities and the circumstances (hearing issues, fear of being shot) add context.\n\nLegally, the line between self-defense and assault can be thin. If she genuinely believed she was in danger, that could justify some force. But hitting someone multiple times after they've been incapacitated might not be. Morally, it's about proportionality. Did she use the minimum necessary force to protect herself? If she hit him once to escape and stop the threat, that's different from hitting five more times. The initial punch might be seen as self-defense, but the subsequent hits could be unjustified once the officer was no longer an immediate threat.\n\nAlso, she did call an ambulance, which is a responsible action. But the initial violence was significant. The officer's injuries were severe, and she's now dealing with the aftermath. The community might have mixed reactions. Since the situation was settled out of court, maybe the legal system saw mitigating factors, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. So considering all that, the answer might be B (No) because her actions were in response to a perceived threat, but the multiple hits after subduing him could tip it. However, if the officer was still a threat, it's different. But once he was slumped against the truck, maybe she overreacted. Given the context of her disabilities and the fear of being shot, the initial reaction might be justified, but the follow-up hits might not be. So maybe she's partially in the wrong, but the question is whether she's entirely in the wrong. Given the circumstances, the answer could be B, not in the wrong, but with a note that the follow-up hits were excessive. But the user is asking for A or B. Given that, the answer might be B (No) because the initial attack was in self-defense due to her disabilities and fear, even if the follow-up was too much. But legally, the line is thin. Since the user is asking for moral judgment, perhaps B is the answer, acknowledging that while her actions were in self-defense, the multiple hits were excessive. But in the end, the answer is B.\n"
