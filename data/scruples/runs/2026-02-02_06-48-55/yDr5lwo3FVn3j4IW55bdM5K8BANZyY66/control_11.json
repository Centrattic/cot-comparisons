I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The situation here is about whether the person who punched a cop is in the wrong. The author is a 24-year-old woman with a hearing impairment and auditory processing disorder. She was in a parking lot, didn't notice an officer, and turned back towards her truck. The officer thought she was running away and approached her, grabbing her arm and pinning her. She then punched him multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, using force against a police officer is a serious offense, even if it's in self-defense. The question is whether her actions were justified. She claims she was scared because the officer grabbed her, and she thought he might shoot her. But she continued to hit him even after he was down, causing significant injury. \n\nIn self-defense, the key factors are whether the force used was reasonable and necessary to prevent harm. If she genuinely believed she was in danger of being shot, then some initial force might be justified. However, hitting him five more times after he was slumped against the truck might be considered excessive. The officer was already incapacitated at that point, so continuing to attack could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nAlso, the fact that she has a disability that affects her hearing could be a factor in how the situation is perceived. The officer's actions\u2014grabbing her and pinning her\u2014might have been rough, and the video evidence shows this, which likely influenced the outcome of the case. The officer later apologized, which might indicate some acknowledgment of his rough handling. \n\nHowever, the law often requires that force must be proportional. Even if the initial punch was in self-defense, continuing to hit an officer who was already down could be considered assault. This might depend on jurisdiction, but in general, once the threat is neutralized, further force isn't justified. \n\nThe author feels conflicted, which suggests she recognizes that her actions went beyond what was strictly necessary. The physical injuries to the officer are severe, and she's responsible for his early retirement and health issues. \n\nSo, while her fear and disability might mitigate some blame, the act of continuing to hit the officer after he was down likely makes her responsible for excessive force. Therefore, she could be in the wrong for the unnecessary attacks beyond the first punch.\n"
