I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe person is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and APD, which affects her ability to process sounds. She was walking in a parking lot, pressed the keyfob, didn't see the truck's lights, so she went back to check. An officer saw her and thought she was running away, called out that he was a cop. She didn't hear because of the traffic noise, so when he grabbed her, she panicked, punched him once, then five more times even after seeing he was a cop and he was injured. She ended up causing serious injuries, but it was settled out of court, and he later apologized. She's conflicted about the excessive force.\n\nFirst, I need to consider self-defense laws. Typically, self-defense allows the use of reasonable force against an imminent threat. If the cop was using excessive force or threatening her life, she might be justified. But here, the officer was trying to detain her, not attacking her. She was being grabbed, which she perceived as a threat. However, after the first punch, the situation might have escalated. Even if she felt threatened initially, continuing to hit an officer who was already subdued could be seen as excessive. \n\nAlso, she had the chance to stop after the first punch but chose to hit more times. The fact that he was a police officer adds another layer. In some jurisdictions, there's a higher standard for using force against law enforcement, especially during a lawful arrest. But if the officer was using unlawful force, that could change things. The parking lot footage showed the officer handled her roughly, which might indicate excessive force from his side. \n\nHer disabilities are a factor here; they might affect her perception and reaction. However, she did stop at one point to call an ambulance, which shows she recognized his injury. The moral conflict she feels suggests she acknowledges her actions went beyond necessary. \n\nLegally, the key points are proportionality and necessity of the force. If she believed her life was in danger, it's different, but she later admits she was in fight mode and feared being shot. But once he was injured and she could see he was a cop, continuing to attack might not be justified. \n\nEthically, she feels bad about the damage, which is important. But the question is whether she was in the wrong. The answer could depend on jurisdiction, but since it's settled out of court, maybe the legal system found her not in the wrong. However, morally, the AITA audience might weigh the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (Not the Asshole) because her impairments affected her reaction, and the officer's actions were rough. But the fact that she kept hitting even after he was subdued could tip it. However, the settlement and the officer's apology might indicate that her actions were justified in the eyes of the legal system. So, leaning towards B, but there's a gray area. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the situation had legitimate reasons for her fear, maybe the answer is B.\n"
