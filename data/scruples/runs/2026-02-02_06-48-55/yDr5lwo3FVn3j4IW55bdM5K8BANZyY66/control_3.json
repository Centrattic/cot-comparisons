I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 24, female, and has a hearing impairment with APD. She explains that she finds it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot near a busy road, which adds to the noise. She was walking back to check if she locked her truck. The officer saw her and thought she was running away, which might have made him assume she was fleeing from the police. \n\nThe officer called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear him because of the traffic noise and her APD. When he approached and grabbed her, she panicked and punched him. She hit him multiple times, even after realizing he was a cop and had already injured him, because she was afraid he might shoot her. The result was serious injuries for the officer, including a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket. She then called an ambulance.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are self-defense laws and the level of force used. In many jurisdictions, self-defense allows the use of force if a person reasonably believes they are in danger. However, if the threat is no longer present, continuing to use force can be considered excessive.\n\nIn this case, the officer was a law enforcement officer who was performing his duty. When he approached, he identified himself as a cop. Even if she didn't hear him initially, once he grabbed her, she had the chance to comply. However, her APD might affect her ability to process that information quickly. But when she realized he was a cop and had already injured him, continuing to hit him might be considered excessive force, especially if the officer wasn't posing an immediate threat anymore. \n\nAlso, the fact that there was video footage showing the officer handling her roughly could indicate that he might have used excessive force himself, which might provide some context. But the author's continued attacks after the initial punch could still be seen as over-the-top, even if she was scared. \n\nOn the other hand, her disabilities might be a mitigating factor. If her APD made it impossible to process the officer's commands in time, maybe her reaction was a reasonable fear response. But once she realized he was a cop and had already been injured, continuing to hit him might cross into unnecessary violence. \n\nThe law often requires that the force used must be proportional to the threat. If the officer wasn't pointing a gun at her and was just trying to detain her, then hitting him multiple times after he was slumped against the truck might not be justified. Even if she thought he might shoot her, once he was down, the immediate threat might have subsided. \n\nThe outcome was settled out of court, which suggests that the legal system might have considered mitigating factors like the officer's conduct and her disability. However, the question isn't about legal responsibility but moral wrongdoing. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances: she acted out of fear due to her disability and the situation. But hitting a law enforcement officer multiple times after the initial threat might have been neutralized could be seen as the wrong thing to do, even if she felt justified. The harm caused to the officer, including his early retirement, adds to the moral dilemma. \n\nIn the end, while her actions were understandable given her fear and disability, the excessive force after the initial attack might make her the asshole. So the answer is A.\n"
