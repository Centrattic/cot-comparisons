I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the woman (24F) who punched a cop multiple times is in the wrong. The situation involves her being hearing impaired with APD, which affects how she processes sounds. She was walking in a parking lot, turned back because she thought she didn't lock her truck, and the officer saw her as a possible fleeing suspect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, the use of force against law enforcement is a serious matter. Even if she felt threatened, there's usually a requirement to comply with police commands unless there's an immediate threat to one's safety. She mentioned she didn't hear the officer calling her, which is part of her APD. But once he physically grabbed her and pinned her against the truck, that's when she reacted. \n\nThe key points here are whether her use of force was justified. The officer was trying to detain her, and she used a haymaker punch, which is a strong, uncontrolled strike. Then she hit him five more times after the initial punch. Even if she was scared, the question is whether her response was proportionate. Punching someone multiple times when they're already subdued might be considered excessive, especially if there's no immediate danger of being shot. She called an ambulance, which shows she didn't intend to seriously harm him beyond defending herself, but the outcome was a bad concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket. That's a lot of damage, which makes the moral question stronger.\n\nAlso, she had the chance to stop after seeing it was a cop and injuring him, but she continued. Even if she was in fear, the legal system would look at whether her fear was reasonable. The officer was there to perform his duty, and while his handling might have been rough, she might still be held accountable for escalating the situation. The fact that it was settled out of court and the officer apologized might suggest some leniency, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just legal consequences. \n\nMorally, she might feel conflicted because she caused significant harm, even if she had a disability. The outcome of the officer retiring early and having memory issues adds to her guilt. The answer would depend on whether her initial fear was justified and if the continued attacks were necessary. Since she had already caused injury and then hit him more, that's where the moral wrong might lie. So the answer might be A (she's in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not overlooking her disability's role in the situation. Some places have laws that consider disabilities in cases of mistaken identity or failure to comply due to impairment. However, even with that, hitting multiple times after the initial defense could still be seen as excessive. So I think the answer is A.\n"
