I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a hearing-impaired woman who had an altercation with a police officer in a parking lot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has APD, which affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was walking towards Walmart, went back to check if her truck was locked, and the officer likely misinterpreted her actions as running away. The officer approached her, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against the truck. The author, feeling threatened, punched him multiple times, causing serious injuries.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are self-defense and the proportionality of her response. Self-defense laws usually consider if the person reasonably believed they were in danger. However, the officer was a law enforcement officer, which complicates things. Even if she felt threatened, using excessive force could be problematic.\n\nThe author mentions that after the initial punch, she continued hitting the officer even though he was injured and she could see he was a cop. The fact that she hit him five more times raises questions about the necessity. Self-defense typically allows for stopping the threat, but continuing to attack beyond that might be considered excessive, especially once the officer was already incapacitated.\n\nAlso, the context of the officer's actions is important. The officer was trying to detain her, which is part of their duty. If the officer had used excessive force, that might justify a defensive response. However, the parking lot footage showed the officer handling her roughly, which could support her perspective. But even so, the subsequent punches after the initial attack could be seen as overkill.\n\nThe author's hearing impairment and APD are relevant because they may explain her misunderstanding the situation. However, these factors don't automatically justify violent escalation. The legal system would consider her disability as part of the context, but the key issue is whether her actions were proportionate to the threat she perceived.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, using force to defend against non-deadly force (like grabbing someone) typically allows for non-deadly force in response. However, if the officer was only using minimal force, and the author responded with lethal force (multiple punches causing serious injury), that might be deemed excessive. The fact that she continued hitting him after he was already injured suggests that the force wasn't proportionate.\n\nAdditionally, the officer later apologized, which might indicate that his actions were at least partially at fault. However, the author's actions led to serious consequences for the officer, including early retirement and memory issues. The author's remorse is noted, but remorse doesn't necessarily negate legal or moral responsibility.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's use of force after the initial punch seems excessive. While her initial reaction might be justified due to fear, continuing to hit the officer after he was incapacitated likely goes beyond self-defense. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
