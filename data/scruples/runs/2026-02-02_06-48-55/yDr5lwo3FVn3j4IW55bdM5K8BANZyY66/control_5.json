I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and APD. She explains that she was in a Walmart parking lot, had to check her truck, and didn't notice the officer. The officer thought she was fleeing, grabbed her, and she punched him multiple times. The result was serious injuries for the officer, and she's asking if she's the asshole for continuing to hit him once he was down.\n\nI need to consider the facts here. She had a legitimate medical condition that affects her hearing. The officer approached her, but she didn't realize he was a cop until after the initial punch. The environment was a noisy parking lot next to a major road, which would make it harder for her to hear. The officer's actions\u2014grabbing and pinning her against the truck\u2014could be seen as aggressive. She felt threatened, which might have triggered her fight-or-flight response. \n\nHowever, after the first punch, he was already incapacitated. She continued to hit him five more times, causing severe injuries. Even if she was scared, once he was down and she could see he was a cop, continuing to attack might be considered excessive. The key here is whether her actions were necessary for self-defense. In many jurisdictions, self-defense typically requires that the force used is reasonable and proportionate to the threat. If the officer was subdued, further attacks might not meet that threshold.\n\nAlso, she did call an ambulance and help until paramedics arrived, which is a positive point. But the question is specifically about whether she was wrong to continue hitting him after he was down. The fact that he later apologized might indicate some fault on his part, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of responsibility for the excessive force.\n\nThere's also the legal aspect: the incident was settled out of court, and there was footage showing the officer handled her roughly. Her disability likely played a role in the outcome. Legally, she might have a defense, but morally, the issue is more nuanced. She trusted the situation was escalating to the point she feared for her life, but once the officer was down, continuing to hit him could be seen as overkill, even if she was still in fear.\n\nIn conclusion, while her initial punch might be seen as a reaction to an immediate threat, the subsequent hits after he was incapacitated could cross into unnecessary violence. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because continuing to hit him once he was down was excessive, even if her initial actions were in self-defense.\n"
