This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, not contributing, and the author felt guilty but did it to push him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. But sending him to a shelter might be seen as harsh. The parent tried other methods like talking and suggesting trade schools, but the son didn't take action. The parent's goal was to force independence, which is a valid concern for parents wanting to help their children become self-sufficient.\n\nHowever, there might be other ways to handle it. For example, cutting off financial support, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging him to find his own place without involving a shelter. The shelter situation could potentially cause trauma or legal issues if the son didn't agree to go. Also, the suddenness of the action without giving the son time to prepare might be questionable. \n\nThe parent's intention was good, but the method might be too extreme. Other parents might handle it by setting strict conditions for living at home, like finding a job or paying rent. The key is whether the parent's actions were necessary and proportionate. Since the son eventually became independent after going to barber school, the outcome is positive, but the means used could be debated.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the parent did what they thought was necessary to push their son out of dependency. However, there's a fine line between tough love and being overly harsh. The answer depends on societal norms and what's considered an appropriate way to encourage independence. Some might say the parent had the right to do it, others might argue it's too extreme without exhausting other options first.\n"
