This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, avoiding responsibility, and being unresponsive to advice. The parent felt guilty but did it to force him to become independent. Eventually, the son went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nHmm. The parent's intention was to push the son to take responsibility. But sending someone to a homeless shelter sounds extreme. Let me think about the possible angles. \n\nFirst, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, so the parent isn't obligated to support him. But the parent might still feel responsible. However, using a homeless shelter as a punishment could be seen as harsh. Did the parent consider other options first? Like setting boundaries with clear consequences, such as moving out but allowing him to stay temporarily with conditions? Or maybe involving other support systems like counseling or job placement services?\n\nThe parent mentions that the son had opportunities to attend trade school but didn't take them. The parent tried to guide him towards a trade, which is reasonable. But maybe there were other steps they could have taken before resorting to the shelter. For example, cutting off financial support entirely, requiring the son to leave the house without the shelter route, or working with social services for alternative solutions.\n\nAlso, the parent sold the house and moved away, which forced the son to make his own plans. That's a valid step, but the method of sending him to the shelter might be questionable. Homeless shelters are for people without any resources, and using it as a wake-up call could be seen as cruel. The son didn't have a job, but did he have nowhere else to go? If the parent is cutting off support, maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's actions did result in the son changing his behavior. He went to barber school and is now self-sufficient. So maybe the extreme measure worked. But does that justify the method? Some might argue that while the outcome is positive, the method was too harsh and could have psychological impacts. Others might think that the parent did what was necessary to push the son towards independence, which is a parent's role sometimes.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions feeling guilty, which suggests they question their own actions. The broader question is about whether sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is an acceptable method of enforcing independence. It's a tough line to walk. In some cultures or parenting styles, strict measures are accepted, but in others, it's seen as inhumane.\n\nConsidering all this, I think there might be better ways to handle it. For example, setting a firm deadline for the son to leave the house without the shelter intervention, or requiring him to find his own place with no financial help. The parent could have provided support while pushing for independence, like helping him find job training or a support network. Sending him to a homeless shelter might be crossing into harmful territory, even if the intention was good.\n\nSo, the author's actions were harsh, but they might not be entirely in the wrong because the son is an adult and the parent was trying to enforce responsibility. However, the method could be questioned. The answer might depend on cultural context and specific circumstances. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because they were trying to help their son become independent, even if the method was extreme. However, others might argue it's A. But given the outcome and the parent's intentions, B seems more likely.\n"
