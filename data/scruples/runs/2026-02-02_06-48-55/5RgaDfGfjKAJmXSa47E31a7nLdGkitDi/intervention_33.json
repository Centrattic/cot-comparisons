This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. The son wasn't working, wasn't taking advice, and the parent was fed up. The parent sold the house and decided to take him to the shelter to force him to become independent. Now, the son went to barber school and is living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is an acceptable method of enforcing responsibility. The son is 23, which is an adult, so the parent's role is more about guidance rather than authority. While the parent had valid concerns about the son's lack of motivation and job instability, the method used here is extreme. Homeless shelters are for people without any support systems, and using that as a wake-up call might be crossing a line. \n\nThe parent mentions that the son didn't fight back, maybe because he knew it was coming, but that doesn't justify the action. The parent could have considered other options first, like cutting off financial support, setting clear boundaries without involving a shelter, or encouraging the son to find temporary housing. The fact that the parent didn't mention consulting the son or giving him a choice could be a problem. Also, the parent's approach might have caused emotional harm, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention was to push the son toward independence, which is a valid goal. The son eventually succeeded, so the method worked in the long run. But the question is about whether the parent was wrong. Some might argue that the parent acted out of love and desperation, while others might see it as overly harsh. I need to weigh the intent against the action. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it's rare for parents to send adult children to shelters, each family's situation is different. The parent might feel it was necessary, but the action is extreme. The key points are the son's age, the parent's alternatives, and the emotional impact. Since the son is an adult, the parent's role should be to support rather than control. The answer might hinge on whether the parent respected the son's autonomy while trying to enforce responsibility. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the parent acted out of a desire to help the son grow, but the method was too harsh and possibly hurtful. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong because there could have been less extreme ways to encourage independence without using a homeless shelter.\n"
