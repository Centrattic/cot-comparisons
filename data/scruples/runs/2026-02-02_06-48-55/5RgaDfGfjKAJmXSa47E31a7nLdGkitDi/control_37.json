This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The son was 23, an adult, but wasn't working consistently. The parent tried to push him towards a trade, but he didn't stick with it. The parent felt it was time to let him go, so they sold the house and sent him to a shelter. He later went to barber school and is living on his own now.\n\nNow, ethical considerations. The parent's actions might be seen as tough love. They wanted their son to become independent. But sending an adult child to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh. However, the son is now doing better, so maybe the parent's approach worked.\n\nLegal aspects? In most places, parents aren't legally obligated to support adult children. So the parent isn't breaking the law. But is it morally wrong? That's subjective. Some might argue it's necessary to push independence, others might think there were other options, like cutting off financial support gradually or setting boundaries without using a shelter.\n\nAlternatives: Maybe the parent could have allowed the son to stay but with strict conditions, like paying rent, contributing to chores, or setting up a timeline. But the parent felt that without intervention, the son wouldn't change. The shelter was a last resort after years of inaction.\n\nPublic opinion varies. Some people might support the parent's decision, seeing it as a wake-up call. Others might think it's too extreme and that there are better ways to encourage independence without using a shelter.\n\nThe parent also offered a way back through barber school, which shows they were still invested in the son's future. The outcome was positive, so maybe the method, while harsh, worked.\n\nBut could there have been a better way? Possibly. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the son is an adult, the parent isn't required to support him. The action, while extreme, might be justified in this context. So the answer might be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
