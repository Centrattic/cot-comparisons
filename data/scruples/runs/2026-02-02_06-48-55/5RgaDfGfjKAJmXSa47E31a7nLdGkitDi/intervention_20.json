This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe parent has a 23-year-old son who wasn't working consistently, was spending a lot of time gaming and with friends, and wasn't taking jobs seriously. The parent tried talking to him about trade school, but the son didn't take it seriously. The son had a few jobs but they didn't last. The parent then decided to sell the house, move away, and leave the son without a place to stay. Eventually, the parent took the son to a homeless shelter, which had limited beds. The son later went to barber school, got a job as a barber, and is now living on his own. The parent is asking if they were in the wrong for sending the son to the shelter.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to force their son to become independent. The son was an adult, so legally, the parent isn't required to support him. However, the question is about whether the parent's actions were morally or socially wrong. \n\nHomelessness is a serious issue, and using a shelter as a last resort might be seen as harsh. The parent might have considered alternatives like setting up a lease agreement, giving the son a time limit with specific conditions, or helping him find employment without resorting to homelessness. The parent could argue it was necessary to teach responsibility, but some might say it's too extreme and could have lasting emotional effects.\n\nThe son's behavior suggests a lack of motivation, but as an adult, he should have the right to make his own choices, even if they're not wise. The parent's action could be seen as a form of coercion. On the other hand, if the parent had continued to support the son without him taking responsibility, that could enable his behavior. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's intent to push the son towards independence versus the method used. The parent might feel justified, but the harshness of the method (homelessness) could be seen as wrong. Also, there's a question of whether the parent had explored all other options before taking such a drastic step.\n\nSome people might argue that the parent's approach was effective in the long run since the son eventually became independent. Others might say that forcing someone into homelessness could be traumatic and that there are more constructive ways to encourage independence without such a drastic measure.\n\nI need to decide if the parent's actions cross the line into being in the wrong. Since the son is an adult, the parent isn't obligated to support him, but using homelessness as a tool might be seen as too harsh. However, the parent's intention was for the son's own good, and the outcome was positive. \n\nThere's a balance between accountability and empathy. While the parent might have had good intentions, the method could be questioned. But since the son is now doing well, some might overlook the harshness. It's a tricky situation. I think the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. However, given the options, I need to choose between A and B.\n\nI think the parent's approach was extreme, but maybe not entirely in the wrong. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they did something drastic (using a homeless shelter) without maybe exhausting all other options, it's possible they are in the wrong. But others might say it was necessary. The final answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their son become independent, even if the method was harsh. But I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
