This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent tried various approaches, like encouraging trade school and discussing the need for a job, but the son didn't take action. The parent eventually sold the house, moved, and when the son didn't change his behavior, they sent him to the shelter. The son later went to barber school and is doing better now.\n\nHmm. The parent's intention was to force their son to become independent. But is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter an appropriate method? On one hand, the parent was trying to protect their son from a life of dependency and encourage him to take responsibility. On the other hand, homeless shelters are meant for people in crisis, not as a disciplinary measure. It could be argued that the parent's actions were harsh and potentially harmful, even if the outcome was positive. Also, the son was an adult, so forcing him into such a situation without alternatives might be seen as extreme. The parent could have explored other options, like legal interventions, setting financial boundaries, or cutting off support. But maybe there were no other options available. The parent might have felt desperate. The key question is whether the method was justified. Some might say it's a harsh but necessary wake-up call, while others might see it as crossing a line. In terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area, but given that the son was an adult and the shelter is for those in need, the parent's approach could be seen as wrong because they used a system meant for the homeless to discipline their son. So the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the parent had no other way to make the son take responsibility, maybe B is the choice. The parent did give him a chance to come back under certain conditions, which shows they wanted him to improve. The outcome was positive, so maybe the method, though extreme, was effective. It's a tough call. Different people might have different opinions. The parent's actions could be seen as overly harsh, but they had tried other methods. The AITA context often considers intentions and outcomes. The parent's intention was to help the son become independent, and the outcome was positive. However, using a homeless shelter as a tool for discipline is ethically questionable. So the answer is probably A, but I need to confirm.\n"
