This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mother who sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The key points to consider are the age of the son, the mother's motivations, the son's behavior, and the alternatives she might have had.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult and responsible for his own decisions. However, he wasn't working, wasn't staying in jobs, and wasn't contributing. The mother tried to push him towards trade school but he didn't take it seriously. She eventually decided to sell the house and move, cutting him off. When he didn't change his behavior, she sent him to a homeless shelter. The son later went to barber school and now works as a barber.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was wrong. On one hand, she's trying to force her adult child to become independent, which is a parent's role. But sending him to a homeless shelter is harsh. Was there a better way? Maybe she could have set other conditions, like requiring him to work or leave the house gradually. But the mother felt that this was necessary to make him realize the consequences of his actions. The son eventually changed after this experience, so maybe it worked. However, using a homeless shelter as a threat or action might be extreme. Also, the mother might have been trying to protect her own needs by moving, and couldn't support him anymore. \n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Parents aren't obligated to support adult children. But the method here is questionable. Other parents might have different approaches, like setting strict boundaries without involving shelters. The mother's actions might be seen as extreme, but her intention was to help him become self-sufficient. The outcome was positive, but the means were harsh. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that parents should try other methods first. However, given the son's inaction despite years of warnings, the mother might feel justified. It's a tough call, but the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because she's trying to enforce independence, even if the method was harsh. However, others might say that the shelter was an unnecessary step. But the fact that the son eventually improved suggests it was effective. So, B seems more likely.\n"
