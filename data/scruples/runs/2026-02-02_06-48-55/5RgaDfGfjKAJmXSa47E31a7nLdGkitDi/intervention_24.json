This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this situation. The parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The son was described as not taking responsibilities, quitting jobs, and not contributing. The parent felt guilty but did it to push the son to get on his own. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to force the son to become self-sufficient. They had given him opportunities before, like suggesting trade school and bartending. But the son didn't take them seriously. The parent tried selling the house to move away, giving the son a final push. When that didn't work, they sent him to the shelter. The son ended up changing after that.\n\nBut is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter the right approach? Well, the son is 23, which is an adult age. The parent might have thought they were doing what's best, but using such a harsh method could be seen as extreme. There might be other ways to encourage independence without causing such a traumatic experience. However, considering the son's history of not taking responsibility, the parent might have felt it was necessary to shock him into action. The outcome was positive\u2014the son became a barber and is living on his own. \n\nOn one hand, the parent's actions forced the son to take responsibility. On the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter can be seen as cruel, even if the intent was to help. There might be support systems or other resources they could have used first. Also, the parent did allow the son to come back under conditions, showing they still cared. \n\nThe question is whether there was a better way. Maybe the parent could have explored other options like setting clear boundaries, financial consequences, or working with a therapist. Using a homeless shelter seems like a last resort, but maybe in this case, it worked. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the parent's perspective. Some might say the parent is in the right for pushing the son to become responsible, while others might argue it's too harsh. Given the positive outcome, but the harsh method, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the parent's actions, while extreme, led to the son's improvement, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But I'm still conflicted. Let me check the options again. Answer A is yes (wrong), B is no. The user says they think the author is in the wrong. But maybe the parent isn't in the wrong because they achieved the desired outcome without legal issues. The son was an adult, so the parent could argue it's about setting boundaries. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
