This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get a clear picture.\n\nThe author has a 23-year-old son who wasn't getting a job, was lazy, and contributed nothing. The author tried to push him into a trade school but he didn't take it seriously. He had some jobs but quit or got fired. The author eventually sold the house and moved, and then sent the son to a homeless shelter when he didn't leave. The son ended up going to barber school, got a job, and now lives on his own. The author is asking if they were in the wrong for sending the son to the shelter.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is trying to enforce independence. At 23, the son is an adult, and the author might feel they've done all they can. But sending someone to a homeless shelter sounds really harsh. Is that a necessary step? Are there other ways to encourage independence without such drastic measures? Maybe cutting off financial support, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging him to find his own place. Also, the son didn't fight back, which might indicate he wasn't completely unaware of his situation. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the shelter had limited beds and they waited until there was an opening. That makes me wonder if the shelter was the best option. Homeless shelters are meant for people who are actually homeless, not for parents trying to push their kids out. Maybe the author should have considered alternatives like a transitional living arrangement, a support program, or maybe even legal consequences if the son wasn't contributing. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation was to force the son to become independent. But using a homeless shelter might have been a shock tactic. While it did work in the end (son went to barber school), was it the right approach? Could it have been traumatic or damaging? The author says it was the hardest thing they ever did, so maybe they felt it was necessary, but others might argue that there's a lack of empathy or alternative strategies considered. \n\nI think the key points here are: the son is an adult, the parent tried to push him towards a trade, he wasn't taking it seriously, and the parent resorted to extreme measures. The question is whether the parent's actions were justified. Some might say that as a parent, they have a right to set boundaries, especially with an adult child who isn't taking responsibility. Others might say that using a homeless shelter is too harsh and that there are better ways to encourage independence without causing harm. \n\nIn the end, the son did turn his life around, which could be seen as a positive outcome. But the method used might be questionable. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce responsibility, but the approach could be seen as extreme. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the son is an adult, the parent isn't legally obligated to support him, but ethically, sending him to a shelter is pretty extreme. There might be more constructive ways to handle it. So I'm leaning towards the parent being in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe answer A or B?\n"
