This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job and was uncooperative. The parent felt guilty but thought it was necessary to push him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They tried various methods to encourage their son to get a job and attend trade school. When he didn't respond, they made a drastic decision. The parent's goal was to force independence, which is a common concern in parenting adult children. They even set conditions for letting him come back, which worked eventually.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter is extreme. It's harsh and might be seen as emotionally damaging. Even though the son turned his life around, the method used was very strict. Other parents might use different approaches like legal steps, cutting off financial support, or seeking professional help. The shelter situation could be traumatic and might not be the most effective or compassionate way to handle it.\n\nThe question is whether this action is justified. Some might argue that the parent had the right to set boundaries, especially if the son was an adult. However, others might say that there are less harmful ways to enforce independence without resorting to such a drastic measure. The parent's guilt also suggests some internal conflict.\n\nI need to check if there are any legal or ethical considerations. Are there laws about parents sending their adult children to shelters? Probably not, since the son is an adult. But ethically, it's debatable. The parent's intention was to help, but the method could be seen as too harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention was to encourage independence, the method chosen might be considered excessive. There could be alternative ways that are less drastic but still effective. So, the author might be in the wrong because of the extreme measure taken, even if the outcome was positive.\n"
