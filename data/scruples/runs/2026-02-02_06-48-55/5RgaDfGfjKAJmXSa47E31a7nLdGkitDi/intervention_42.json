This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The author sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job and was uncooperative. The son had a history of not holding jobs, not contributing, and the mom felt she had to take drastic action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so legally, the mother isn't obligated to support him. However, sending him to a homeless shelter might be extreme. There might be other options like encouraging him to move out gradually, offering support while pushing independence, or finding other resources like job training programs. The mother did mention trade school suggestions, but maybe she could have enforced consequences sooner or provided more structured support rather than immediate shelter placement.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's intention was to force her son to become self-sufficient. She tried to set boundaries by selling the house and moving away, which shows she gave him time to prepare. The son eventually did take up the barber school offer, which worked out. But the method of using a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, especially if there were alternative steps that could have been taken first. The mother's actions could be defended as a last resort after years of inaction, but some might argue that the emotional impact on the son and the potential trauma of being sent to a shelter without prior support could be problematic. \n\nIt's also important to consider cultural context. In some cultures, parents might have different expectations and approaches to adult children's independence. The mother's strict measures might be viewed differently based on societal norms. Additionally, the son's response\u2014eventually taking the advice and succeeding\u2014suggests that the approach, while extreme, was effective. \n\nHowever, the key question is whether there was a \"better way.\" The mother claims not knowing of other parents using this method, which might indicate she felt it was necessary. But alternatives like setting clear deadlines, providing temporary housing while requiring job searches, or involving other family members could have been options. The suddenness of the shelter visit without prior warnings (beyond verbal ones) might be seen as harsh, especially if the son was unprepared despite knowing the house was being sold.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's intention to push independence is understandable, the method used could be debated. The answer hinges on whether the extreme action was justified given the circumstances and if there were less traumatic alternatives. The effectiveness in the end doesn't necessarily absolve the approach if it was unnecessarily harsh. So, there's a case for both sides, but the consensus might lean towards the mother not being in the wrong, but the action being a tough love scenario.\n"
