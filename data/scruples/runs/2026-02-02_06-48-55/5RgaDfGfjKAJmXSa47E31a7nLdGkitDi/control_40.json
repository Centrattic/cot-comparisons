This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the son was 23 when this happened, so he's an adult. The parent mentions he didn't contribute much, had friends over, and couldn't keep jobs. The parent gave him opportunities, like suggesting trade school, and even offered a specific trade (barbering). The son tried bartending and some other jobs but didn't stick with them. The parent eventually sold the house and moved away, leading to the decision to send him to a shelter.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. While the son is responsible for his own actions, the parent's method might be questionable. Even though the parent might have felt justified to push the son towards independence, using a homeless shelter as a \"wake-up call\" could be seen as harsh. There might be alternative, less extreme measures, like insisting he leave the house but without the immediate threat of homelessness, or involving other support systems.\n\nHowever, the parent did set a condition for the son to come back: attending barber school, which the son agreed to and succeeded in. So the outcome was positive. But the method of sending him to a shelter might have been traumatic and unnecessary. The parent might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce independence, but the approach could be debated. In some cultures or family dynamics, this might be seen as a last resort. Still, it's a very strict action. So the answer might hinge on whether the action was proportionate to the problem. The parent's intent was to force responsibility, but the means could be seen as excessive. However, since the son eventually improved, the parent's actions might be considered justified, making the answer B (not in the wrong). But others might argue it's A because of the harshness. Need to weigh societal norms and possible alternatives. The question is whether there was a better way, but the parent might not have considered other options like finding a support group, job placement services, or legal eviction. But since the parent did eventually help him by allowing him back under conditions, maybe B is the answer.\n"
