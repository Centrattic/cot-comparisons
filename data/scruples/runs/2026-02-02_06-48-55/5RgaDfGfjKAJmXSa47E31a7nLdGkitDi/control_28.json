This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (mother) is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. Let me consider the details.\n\nFirst, the son was an adult, so legally an adult. The mother tried various methods to encourage him to get a job and find his path. He had some jobs but they were short-lived. The mother eventually decided to sell her house and move, giving him a deadline. When he still didn't take action, she sent him to a homeless shelter. The son later went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nHmm, the key points here: the son is an adult. The mother's actions might be seen as extreme, but she was trying to push him towards independence. But sending an adult child to a homeless shelter? That's a big step. Are there other ways? Maybe cutting off financial support, but she did that by moving and not letting him live with her. The shelter was a last resort. However, homeless shelters are for people who can't afford housing. If the son could afford his own place but chose not to, maybe the shelter wasn't the right place. But if he couldn't, then the mother might have a point. But the shelter might have other requirements like job training programs. Also, the mother's intention was to force him to grow up. The outcome was positive; he became a barber. But the method might be questionable. Ethically, is it right to send an adult child to a homeless shelter? It could be seen as harsh, but if the child is capable and just not taking responsibility, maybe it's necessary. The mother didn't take away his options but forced him into a situation where he had to take action. The community's view on this would vary. Some might say it's tough love, others might think it's inhumane. The answer hinges on whether the mother's actions were appropriate given the son's age and circumstances. Since he's an adult, she's not legally obligated to support him. The question is about moral wrong, not legal. If she made a tough decision to push him to independence, some might say she's not in the wrong. Others might argue she should have tried other methods first. But in the end, the son turned his life around, which might support her approach. The answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
