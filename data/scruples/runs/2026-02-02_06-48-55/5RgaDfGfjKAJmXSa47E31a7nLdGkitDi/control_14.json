This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. The son had a history of not holding jobs, being uncooperative, and the parent eventually decided to move away and send him to the shelter when the house sold. The son then went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their son to become independent and take responsibility, which is a valid goal. However, using a homeless shelter as a method to force change might be seen as harsh. The parent had warned the son before, so there's some due process there. But is sending someone to a shelter an appropriate action when they're an adult?\n\nAdult children are legally adults, so parents aren't obligated to support them. The parent here is trying to enforce independence. However, the method used could be questioned. A homeless shelter is meant for people without any resources. The parent had the means to support their son but chose to cut off support abruptly. There might be alternative steps, like setting clear boundaries with consequences, providing some support for trade school, or allowing the son to face natural consequences without institutional intervention.\n\nAlso, the parent's motivation is to help the son become self-sufficient. The outcome was positive\u2014the son became a barber and is living on his own. But the means of getting there involved using a homeless shelter, which could be seen as manipulative or extreme. The parent might have crossed a line by using the shelter as a threat or a punishment, which might not be necessary if the intent was genuine help.\n\nOther factors: The parent sold the house, moving away, which is a significant step. The son had a year's notice before the house sold, so he had time to prepare. However, the parent didn't offer other options during that time. The shelter was a last resort after multiple failed attempts to get the son to work. The parent's actions might be seen as necessary from their perspective, but the ethical question is whether it's right to use a homeless shelter as a method of coercion.\n\nIn some contexts, sending an adult child to a shelter could be viewed as a way to force them into responsibility, but it's a drastic measure. There might be a lack of empathy or consideration for the son's personal circumstances. However, the parent's actions did lead to the son's improvement. The key is whether the method was appropriate. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people might not advocate for sending someone to a homeless shelter unless they have no other options. Parents usually set boundaries through other means. The parent here might be in the right if their intent was to help, but the method could be questioned. On the other hand, if the son was an adult and the parent isn't legally or financially obligated to support him, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for cutting off support. However, using a homeless shelter might be seen as an extreme step, potentially causing unnecessary hardship without alternatives. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parent had other options. Since the parent mentions calling the shelter because the beds were full and then using that as a last resort, it's possible they didn't have other resources. But maybe there were other ways to encourage independence without the shock of a shelter. The parent's actions might be justified in their intent but the method could be seen as too harsh. However, since the parent's goal was positive and the outcome was positive, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer is tricky, but I lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent was trying to enforce independence, even if the method was extreme. But some might argue A (in the wrong) for the harshness. The community's perspective on AITA often considers intent and outcome. Since the outcome was positive and the parent's intent was to help, maybe B is the better choice.\n"
