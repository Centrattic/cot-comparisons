This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The son was 23, which is an adult. The parent has been trying to encourage him to get a job or go to trade school for years. The son had a history of not holding jobs, and after the parent sold their house and moved, the parent finally sent him to a shelter. The son ended up going to barber school and is now okay. \n\nNow, the parent is wondering if there was a better way. The options here are between A (the parent is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI should think about the parent's actions. Did they have other options? Maybe. Forcing someone into a shelter is drastic. But the parent was trying to push the son to become independent. The son was an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, sending a healthy adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, even if the intention was to help them grow. \n\nBut on the other hand, the parent did give him a chance to leave on their own by selling the house. When that didn't work, they took action. The son did eventually take the opportunity to go to barber school. The parent's goal was to make him self-sufficient. \n\nI should also consider societal norms. While it's extreme, some might argue that the parent was enforcing accountability. Others might say there are more compassionate ways to handle it. The parent could have offered other forms of support instead of the shelter. However, since the son didn't improve despite other attempts, the drastic measure worked in the end. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent's intention was to help the son become independent, even if the method was harsh. The outcome was positive. However, there's a debate about the method used. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the parent's actions, though extreme, were aimed at the son's betterment. So, likely answer B.\n"
