This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent tried various ways to encourage their son, like suggesting trade schools and jobs, but he didn't follow through. Eventually, the parent decided to move away and send him to the shelter when the house sold. The son then went to barber school and is now working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They tried to set boundaries and encourage independence, which is a common parenting approach. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. But since the son is an adult, the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The parent's goal was to force responsibility, which could be seen as a tough love approach.\n\nOn the other hand, using a homeless shelter as a punishment might be criticized because it's a public resource meant for those in dire need, not for disciplinary purposes. The parent could have explored other options like helping him find a job or setting up a structured support system instead of immediate removal.\n\nThe son's behavior was problematic\u2014he wasn't contributing, had a history of job instability, and didn't take responsibility. The parent's actions led to the son eventually getting a job, which is a positive outcome. However, the method might be seen as harsh. There's a debate here between the parent's right to enforce independence and the potential misuse of social services.\n\nI think the key points are the adult son's responsibility and the parent's intent to help him become self-sufficient. While the method was extreme, the parent's intention was to push the son towards independence. Other parents might use different methods, but the outcome was positive. So, the parent might not be in the wrong, but the method could be questioned. However, since the son is an adult, the parent isn't obligated to provide a home, so the answer might lean towards \"No\" (B).\n"
