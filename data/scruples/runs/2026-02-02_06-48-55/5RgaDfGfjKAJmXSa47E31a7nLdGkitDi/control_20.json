This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent's son is 23, was lazy, didn't hold jobs, and after selling the house, the parent sent him to a shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nSo, the parent's intention was to push their son to become independent. They tried talking to him, gave him options for trade school, but he didn't take it. When the parent moved away, they couldn't take him, leading to the shelter incident. \n\nNow, to determine if the parent is wrong. Sending an adult child to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh. Even though the parent's goal was to help, the method might be questionable. Is it acceptable to use such extreme measures? Could there have been other options, like moving out with a support plan, or involving social services?\n\nBut the parent also had a right to their own life and independence. The son was an adult, so the parent wasn't obligated to support him indefinitely. The parent's actions might have been a tough love approach, which some might support, while others might criticize the method. \n\nHowever, using a homeless shelter as a forced measure might not be the best approach. It's possible the parent could have found other ways to encourage independence without resorting to that. But since the son eventually got better, the outcome is positive. \n\nIn terms of the parent's responsibility, once the child is an adult, the parent isn't legally responsible anymore. But morally, it's a gray area. The parent had to make a choice between their own well-being and their son's. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the parent isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their adult son become independent, even if the method was extreme. So the answer would be B.\n"
