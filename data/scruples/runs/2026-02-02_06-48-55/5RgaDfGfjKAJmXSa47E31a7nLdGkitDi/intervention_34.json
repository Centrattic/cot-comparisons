This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a mother who sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. She felt guilty but did it to push him to become independent. The son then went to barber school and is now living on his own. The question is if the mother is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son was 23, which is an adult. Adult children are expected to be responsible for themselves, but the mother here took extreme measures. She gave him an ultimatum after years of him not holding a job. The shelter situation was a last resort after selling the house and moving away.\n\nOn one hand, the mother might have felt she had no other choice. She tried convincing him to go to trade school, he didn't take it seriously. She gave him time but eventually had to enforce a consequence. Sending him to a shelter could be seen as a harsh but effective way to make him realize he needs to take responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a homeless shelter isn't the appropriate place for an adult who just needs to be motivated. There might be other options, like cutting off financial support, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging him to seek help through other means. Also, cutting off completely without support might not be the best approach, even if he's an adult. The mother's actions might be seen as too drastic, especially since the son eventually did become responsible.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The mother felt guilty, and the son didn't resist, which might indicate he saw it coming. However, using a homeless shelter as a consequence could be traumatic and might not be necessary if there are other ways to enforce independence.\n\nBut then, maybe in this case, the shelter was the only way to force the son to take action. The mother's intention was to make him self-sufficient, which is a valid parent's goal. The outcome was positive\u2014son became a barber and is living on his own. So, while the method was harsh, the result was what she wanted.\n\nBut is the method justified? Some people might think that even though the outcome is good, the means were too extreme. Others might support her because she took action when all else failed. Also, cultural norms vary\u2014some cultures expect parents to support children until they're independent, while others might see cutting off completely as necessary.\n\nThe key points here are: the son's age (adult), the mother's attempts to help him before, the severity of the action (homeless shelter), and the eventual success. The mother might not be in the wrong because she was trying to enforce responsibility, but others might argue that there were less extreme measures. However, given that she tried other methods and this was the only way to make him change, maybe she's not at fault. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because her intention was to push him towards independence, which is a parent's role, even if the method was harsh.\n"
