This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The question is to answer A or B, nothing else. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the son is 23, so he's an adult. The parent tried to encourage him to get a job or go to trade school over the years. He had some jobs but didn't last. The parent then decided to move and sent him to the shelter when the house was sold. The son eventually went to barber school and is now doing well.\n\nNow, considering the context: the parent's intention was to force independence. But is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter an appropriate method? Homelessness is a serious issue. While the parent wanted to teach responsibility, using a homeless shelter might be extreme. The parent could have other options, like setting boundaries without causing immediate homelessness, such as cutting financial support, requiring a job as a condition to live at home, or helping him find resources. \n\nHowever, the parent did offer a condition (barber school) after the shelter incident, which led to positive change. But the method of using the shelter might be seen as harsh. The parent's actions might be justified if they felt it was the only way to get through to the son. But others might argue that it's not the parent's responsibility to make an adult child homeless. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while pushing a child to become independent is common, using a homeless shelter is rare and extreme. The parent's guilt suggests internal conflict. The key factors are the son's age (adult), the parent's attempts to help, and the effectiveness of the method used. \n\nSo, the answer could depend on whether the shelter was the best option. The parent might not be in the wrong if they believed it was the only way to help, but others might disagree. However, the parent's actions could be seen as overstepping, so maybe A for wrong. But the outcome was positive. Hmmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the parent is not in the wrong because they were trying to help their son become independent, even if the method was extreme. There's no clear right answer, but the parent's intent was to encourage growth, and it worked. The question is if the method is wrong. \n\nIn some viewpoints, yes, because it's using homelessness as a tactic. In others, no, because parents have to do what's necessary for their child's betterment. The community might have mixed reactions. The parent did escalate after years of attempts. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the parent's intention was to help, and it worked. But the method might be questionable. \n\nI think the answer is B. The parent's actions, while harsh, were aimed at helping the son become independent, and it succeeded. The parent did consider alternatives (like setting conditions) but might have felt the shelter was necessary. So, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
