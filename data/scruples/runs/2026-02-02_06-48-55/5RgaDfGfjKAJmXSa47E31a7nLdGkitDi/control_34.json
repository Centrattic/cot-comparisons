This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The situation is that the son was 23, didn't hold jobs, and the parent eventually sent him to a shelter. The parent later helped him by allowing him to live at home again if he went to barber school, which he did.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once someone turns 18, they're adults, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support them. The son was 23, so the parent isn't breaking any laws here. But the moral aspect is more complex.\n\nThe parent tried talking to the son about getting a job and even suggested trade schools. The son didn't take it seriously. The parent felt they had exhausted all options and decided to send him to a shelter as a last resort. The parent's intention was to force the son to become independent.\n\nNow, the key question is whether sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is an appropriate action. Some might argue that it's harsh but necessary to teach responsibility. Others might say it's inconsiderate and could have long-term emotional effects on the relationship. The parent did provide a way out by offering a path to return if he went to barber school, which he did. The son eventually became independent, which is a positive outcome.\n\nHowever, alternative solutions could have been explored, like moving out gradually, setting up a structured support plan, or involving other family members or professionals. Sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme, but given the parent's perspective, they felt it was necessary after trying other methods.\n\nIn terms of public opinion, similar \"Am I the Asshole?\" threads often receive mixed responses. Some people might side with the parent for taking a tough but effective approach, while others might criticize the harshness. But since the parent's action led to the son becoming self-sufficient, it's hard to say if they're in the wrong. The parent also felt guilty, which shows they considered the consequences.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted in what they believed was their son's best interest to encourage independence, even if the method was extreme. The outcome was positive, which might justify the approach in this case.\n"
