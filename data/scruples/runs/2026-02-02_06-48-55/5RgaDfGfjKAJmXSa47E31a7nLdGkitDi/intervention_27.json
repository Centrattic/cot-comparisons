This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who took their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's reasoning is that the son wasn't working, wasn't taking their advice seriously, and after selling their house, they felt forced to send him to the shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They tried talking to the son about getting a job, suggesting trade schools, and even setting a deadline when moving away. When that didn't work, they resorted to extreme measures. The parent's intention was to push the son to become independent, which they succeeded in, as the son now has a job and lives on his own.\n\nOn the other hand, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter raises ethical concerns. While the son is an adult, the parent might still feel responsible for their well-being. Homeless shelters are for people in urgent need, not as a punitive measure. The parent's actions could be seen as harsh, even if the outcome was positive. There might have been other ways to encourage independence without resorting to such an extreme step, like cutting off financial support or encouraging the son to live with friends or family.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the shelter only had four beds and was full, which might have been a factor in the decision. However, even in that case, using the shelter as a means to force the son to leave might not be the best approach. It's possible the parent felt desperate and used what they perceived as necessary to make the son take responsibility.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, it's unusual for parents to send adult children to shelters. Other methods like setting strict boundaries, providing resources for job training, or allowing the son to face natural consequences might be more appropriate. The parent did eventually allow the son to come back under conditions, which helped the son turn his life around. But the initial action of sending him to the shelter might be seen as too extreme, especially since it's a traumatic experience for someone of that age.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the parent's intent was to help the son become self-sufficient, the method used could be questioned. The line between tough love and neglect can be blurry. The parent might not be in the wrong if they believe they were protecting their own needs (selling the house, moving) and pushing the son to grow. However, the shelter is typically for people without any support systems, so using it as a tactic might not be fair to the son or the shelter's purpose.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parent's actions, though effective, were justified. There's a debate between the outcome (son became independent) and the method (using a homeless shelter). Some might argue that the parent did what was necessary, while others would say there were better, less harsh alternatives. Given the options, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong (B) because they acted out of love and necessity, but it's a close call.\n"
