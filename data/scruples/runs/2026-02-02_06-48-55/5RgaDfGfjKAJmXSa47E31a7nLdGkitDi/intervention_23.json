This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who took their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's intention was to force the son to become independent after years of not holding down a job or contributing. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. Sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. While the parent had been trying to encourage independence through various means, the final step was quite severe. The parent mentions that they had given the son opportunities to make better choices, but when the son didn't take them, they decided to take this action. \n\nNow, thinking about the son's age\u201423 is an adult. The parent's responsibility might be more about guidance rather than enforcing such a harsh punishment. However, the parent did set boundaries and followed through, which could be seen as necessary for the son's growth. \n\nBut is sending someone to a homeless shelter appropriate? Homeless shelters are meant for people in immediate need, not as a disciplinary measure. Even if the parent believed it was the only way to push their son, using a homeless shelter might not be the right approach. It could cause trauma, and there are other ways adults can be held accountable without such extreme measures. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention was to help the son become independent. The son eventually succeeded after being sent away, which is a positive outcome. The parent also offered a way back through barber school, which shows they still cared. \n\nHowever, the method used raises ethical questions. There's a line between tough love and causing unnecessary hardship. The parent might not be in the wrong if their goal was to help, but the means were questionable. The broader perspective is about the rights of an adult child to make their own mistakes and the parent's role in that process. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might understand the parent's frustration, using a homeless shelter isn't a common or recommended approach. Other methods like cutting off financial support, encouraging job searches, or seeking professional help might be more constructive. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's intention was to help, but the method may have been excessive and potentially harmful. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because the action was too harsh, but others might argue it was necessary for the son's development (B). However, given that the son was an adult, the parent's role is to support rather than control, making the action questionable. I'm leaning towards A.\n"
