This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent wrote about taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding down jobs, spending time gaming, and not contributing. The parent tried to encourage him to go to trade school or learn a skill, especially since they themselves are a barber and had a good living from a trade. The son worked a bartending job for 6 months, then some short-term jobs, and kept quitting or getting fired. After the parent decided to move and the house was sold, they sent him to the shelter. Eventually, the son went to barber school, became a barber, and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the son. At 23, he's an adult, so the parent's responsibility is different than if he were a minor. The parent is trying to enforce independence, which makes sense, but the method used was sending him to a homeless shelter. That seems pretty drastic. The parent did give him opportunities before, like suggesting trade school, even choosing barber school as a specific option. But the son didn't take them. The parent was firm and set a deadline after selling the house. The shelter was a last resort after the son didn't change his behavior even when the parent was moving.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if there was a better way and if others think they're in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to decide based on the context. \n\nPossible arguments for A (wrong): The parent might have been too harsh. Even though the son was not working, a homeless shelter is a severe punishment. Maybe there were other steps they could have taken first, like cutting off financial support, making him find a place to stay, or other forms of accountability. Sending someone to a shelter could be seen as using fear tactics, and some might argue that it's not a constructive approach. Also, the parent's guilt suggests they might have felt it was a drastic measure, which could imply they did something they later regret.\n\nPossible arguments for B (not wrong): The parent had exhausted all other options and had been patient over the years. The son wasn't taking responsibility, so the parent took a necessary step to push him towards independence. The alternative was letting him stay and continue being dependent. The shelter was a temporary measure that eventually led the son to take action. In some cases, tough love is required for adults who aren't self-sufficient.\n\nI need to weigh these. The parent's intention was to motivate the son to become independent, which is a valid goal. However, the method of using a homeless shelter, which is typically for people in dire straits, seems extreme. But maybe the parent felt it was the only way left. The son did eventually go to barber school, which the parent wanted for him, so the outcome was positive. The parent might have felt that without a drastic action, the son wouldn't change. \n\nConsidering societal standards, while it's not common for parents to send adult children to shelters, each situation is unique. The parent's actions were a form of tough love, perhaps. However, some might argue that it's the parent's responsibility to support their child until they can stand on their own, but at 23, the line between support and enabling could be crossed. The key is whether the parent had a duty to find a less harsh way or if this was a reasonable step given the son's refusal to take responsibility. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions they called every day until there was an opening. That shows effort to find a place for him. But maybe the parent should have considered other options, like subletting, living with friends, or other temporary housing before the shelter. However, the parent states they tried and the shelter was one of the few options available. \n\nI think the parent's actions, while harsh, were aimed at getting the son to take responsibility. The outcome worked, so maybe the method was justified in this case. But others might see it as too extreme. The answer would depend on whether the parent is considered to have crossed the line into cruelty. The parent didn't mention physical harm or anything like that, just cutting off support. \n\nSo the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the intention was to push the son towards independence and the parent had already tried other methods. But if the shelter was an unnecessary and harmful step, then A. Given the son's behavior and the parent's prior efforts, B might be the right choice.\n"
