This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for taking their adult son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent feels guilty but is unsure if there was a better way.\n\nFirst, the son is 23, which is an adult. The parent has been trying to push him towards a trade for years but he hasn't held jobs. The parent sells the house, moves away, and then sends him to the shelter. The son eventually goes to barber school and becomes independent.\n\nSo, the key points: The parent used a harsh method to force independence. Was there a better way? Maybe. But was the parent wrong? Well, the son was an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The shelter situation might have been a last resort after other methods failed. The parent might have felt they had no choice to stop enabling the behavior. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter could be seen as extreme. But considering the son's age and the parent's efforts to guide him, maybe it's not wrong. The community might view it as a tough love approach. But I need to check if there's any ethical or legal issues. Legally, the parent can't force an adult to leave, but sending them to a shelter isn't illegal. Ethically, it's debatable. Some might say it's harsh but necessary for growth. Others might think there were other options. The son ended up better, which shows the method worked. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no exploitation or harm done. The parent's actions were to push the son to become independent, which is a parent's role. So, likely B.\n"
