This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son is 23, which is an adult. The parent has been pushing him to get a job or go to trade school for years. The son has had some jobs, like bartending, but they didn't last. He's been living at home, not contributing, and the parent eventually decides to move away, making him move out. When the house sells, the parent takes him to a homeless shelter. The son ends up going to barber school, getting a job, and living on his own now.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is that they wanted to make the son responsible and force him to grow up. The parent felt guilty but did it for the son's own good. The son didn't argue, which suggests he might have known this would happen eventually.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if there was a better way. The key points to consider are the son's age, his responsibility to be independent, and the method used. Since he's an adult, the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, using a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. Did the parent have other options? Maybe they could have set conditions for staying, like requiring the son to work or attend school. But the parent did offer a condition later when the son called to come back\u2014barber school. That worked out.\n\nBut the immediate issue is the use of the shelter. Some might argue that it's extreme, while others might see it as necessary to push the son to change. It's a tough call. The parent did care, as the son eventually succeeded. But the method might not be the best approach. Other parents might use different methods, like cutting off financial support or setting clear boundaries without involving a shelter. However, given the son's history of not taking responsibility, maybe this was a last resort. The parent's actions did lead to the son getting his life together, which is a positive outcome. However, the emotional impact on the son and the parent could be significant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intention was to enforce responsibility. The method might be questionable, but the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. In the end, the son is better off, which supports the parent's decision. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to encourage independence, even if the method was harsh.\n"
