This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, not contributing, and the parent finally decided to take drastic action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The parent might be within their rights to set boundaries. But then there's the moral or ethical angle. Sending someone to a homeless shelter is pretty extreme. Was there a better way to encourage independence? Maybe other options like giving him an ultimatum to find his own place or support with conditions?\n\nThe parent mentions that the son wasn't college material but suggested trade schools. The son did bartend for a while but didn't stick with it. The parent tried to push him towards barber school, which he eventually went to. However, the method used was sending him to a shelter. That might have been a shock tactic to make him realize he needs to take responsibility. But was it necessary? Could it have been traumatic or damaging?\n\nAlso, the parent later allowed the son to come back under the condition of going to barber school. So the outcome was positive. But the means of getting there was sending him to a shelter. I wonder if there are other parents who have handled similar situations without such drastic measures. The parent feels guilty, which might indicate their own doubts.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the shelter's role. Homeless shelters are for people without homes. If the son was being sent there temporarily as a wake-up call, does that misuse the shelter's purpose? Maybe the parent should have explored other avenues first, like finding a transitional living program or community resources designed for young adults needing support.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, some might argue that the parent's approach was harsh but effective. Others might say it's cruel and could have long-term negative effects on the parent-child relationship. The son didn't resist, which might show he saw it coming, but it's unclear if he felt it was fair.\n\nI also need to consider cultural context. In some cultures, such actions might be seen as necessary for the child's growth, while in others, it might be viewed as neglect or abuse. The parent's motivation seems to be for the son's own good, but the method could be questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the parent isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. Other options might have been available. The effectiveness is there since the son succeeded after, but the method was extreme. The parent's guilt suggests internal conflict. The question is whether the method was justified. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if focusing on the intent and outcome, or A (in the wrong) if considering the method too harsh without alternatives.\n"
