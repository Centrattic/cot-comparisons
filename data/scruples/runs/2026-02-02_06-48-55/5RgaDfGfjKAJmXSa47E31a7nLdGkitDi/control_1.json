This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. The parent's reasoning is that they wanted him to learn independence, and they did offer a condition for him to come back, which he followed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once someone is an adult, their parents aren't legally responsible for their care. So the parent isn't obligated to support their son financially or provide a home. The parent here has given the son multiple chances and set boundaries, which seems reasonable.\n\nNext, the parent's actions were a last resort after the son didn't take responsibility. The parent did give a warning before selling the house and moving. The shelter was a temporary measure to push the son towards independence. It's harsh, but some might argue it was necessary to break the cycle of dependency.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter could be seen as extreme. Are there other options that were considered? The parent mentioned they tried to talk about trade schools and jobs, but the son didn't follow through. Maybe alternatives like a structured rehab program, community service, or even temporary housing with strict conditions could have been explored. However, the parent might not have had those resources available or knew about them.\n\nThe son eventually did take the condition given (barber school) and is now independent. That shows the action had the desired effect. The parent's intention was to force change, and it worked. But is using a homeless shelter the right approach? It's a very public and harsh method, which could have emotional consequences. However, the parent did offer support once the son met the condition, showing they still care.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say that the parent was within their rights as the son is an adult, and the parent isn't responsible for his adult life. Others might argue that it's cruel to use a homeless shelter as a punishment, even if the son is an adult. It could be seen as a last resort, but there's a line between tough love and neglect.\n\nI should also consider if there were underlying issues the parent didn't address. Maybe the son has mental health issues or other challenges that weren't considered. The parent might not have sought professional help, like counseling, which could have been an alternative.\n\nOverall, the parent's actions were extreme but possibly justified given the circumstances. They did set clear boundaries and followed through, which led to the son becoming independent. However, the method might not be the most compassionate one. But from a legal and parental responsibility standpoint, the parent isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
