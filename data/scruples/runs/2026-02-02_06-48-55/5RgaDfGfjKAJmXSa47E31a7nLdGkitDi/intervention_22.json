This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, being unresponsive to advice, and the parent eventually decided to cut him off by moving away and then sending him to the shelter. The son later attended barber school and is now living independently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, once someone is an adult, parents aren't legally obligated to support them. So, the parent isn't breaking the law by doing this. However, the action of sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, even if the parent isn't legally wrong.\n\nNext, the context: the son was 23, which is an adult age. The parent tried to encourage him to get a trade but he didn't follow through. The parent tried selling the house and moving as a warning, which the son ignored. The shelter was used as a last resort after the house was sold. The parent's intention was to force independence, which worked in the end since the son became a barber.\n\nBut the method is controversial. Using a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. Other options could have been discussed, like moving out and requiring him to pay rent, or involving other family members. However, the parent might have felt that the shelter's environment would push the son to change more effectively.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the parent has a duty to protect their child even if they're an adult, while others might see it as necessary for the son's growth. The parent's guilt suggests they felt conflicted, which adds complexity.\n\nThe son's reaction wasn't aggressive, indicating he might have seen this as a consequence he deserved. The outcome was positive in that he became self-sufficient. However, the approach could have been traumatic. Whether it's right or wrong depends on cultural norms, personal values, and the specifics of the situation.\n\nIn some cases, parents might use other methods like cutting off financial support or setting clear boundaries without involving external shelters. The author's method worked but might not be the only correct approach. The key is whether the action was proportionate and necessary. Since the parent had tried multiple times to guide the son and he didn't change, the extreme measure might be justified in their eyes, but others might argue for a more gradual approach.\n"
