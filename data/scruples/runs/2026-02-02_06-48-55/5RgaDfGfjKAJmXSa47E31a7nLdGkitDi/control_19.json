This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe mom's son is 23, hasn't held a job for long, plays video games, has friends over, and ignores advice. The mom tried to push him towards a trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. He left jobs quickly or got fired. The mom then decided to sell the house and move away, not letting him come. After the house sold, she took him to a homeless shelter. He later went to barber school (since she's a barber) and now lives on his own. The question is whether the mom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a person is 18, they are considered adults, and parents aren't legally obligated to support them. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might have legal implications if it's considered abandoning or neglecting them. But since the mom is giving him a chance to live independently, maybe it's not neglect. But I'm not sure about the laws here.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The mom's intention was to push her son to become self-sufficient. She tried various methods over the years, including trade school suggestions, but he didn't respond. The shelter was a last resort. Some might argue that using a homeless shelter as a \"tough love\" tactic is harsh but effective. Others might say it's inhumane, especially if there were alternatives. The shelter had limited spots, so maybe she didn't have a better option. But did she explore other options first?\n\nThe son was given some conditions later (go to barber school) and complied. It seems like the action worked in the long run. But was there a better way? Maybe giving him a structured environment, like a rehab or a support program, rather than the shelter. However, the mom might not have had access to those resources or thought the shelter was the only way to force change.\n\nSocially, some people might see this as a necessary measure for the son's growth, while others might criticize the method as too extreme. The key is whether the action was proportionate to the problem. The mom had tried to communicate for years, and the son wasn't responsive. The shelter was a means to an end to make him take responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: the mom might have a right to her own life and needs, moving away, and not continuing to support an unproductive adult. However, the method of using a homeless shelter could be seen as cruel if the son was vulnerable. But the shelter provides basic needs, so maybe it's a safe option.\n\nI should also consider the potential trauma of being sent to a shelter. It's a drastic step, but if the son was already neglecting his responsibilities, maybe it was the only way to break the cycle. The outcome was positive, so does that justify the means?\n\nIn some cases, parents might use other strategies like cutting off financial support, but the mom might have already done that by moving away. The shelter was her way of enforcing independence.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was necessary and if there were alternatives. Since the mom tried various methods over years and the shelter was a last resort, and it led to a positive outcome, some might argue she's not in the wrong. However, others might say that the shelter is an extreme measure and that there are more constructive approaches. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. In terms of legal and ethical standards, unless there was harm, maybe it's a matter of opinion. Given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Some might argue that using a homeless shelter is inappropriate regardless. But since the son eventually improved, it's a mixed case. I'll go with B.\n"
