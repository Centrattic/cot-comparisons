This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent's son was 23, didn't hold jobs, and was living with them. The parent sold the house and moved away, then sent the son to a shelter. The son later went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, at 18, a person is considered an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support them. But the parent is choosing to cut off support, which is their right. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. Are there other legal responsibilities here?\n\nThe parent might be within their rights to remove support, but the method could be questioned. The shelter was full initially, and the parent waited until there was a spot. Was there another way to enforce independence? Maybe giving the son an ultimatum to leave the house instead of the shelter? The parent mentions other parents not resorting to this, which is a point against them. \n\nThe son eventually succeeded after being sent to the shelter, which shows the action had a positive outcome. But the moral question is whether the parent should have found a less extreme method. Also, the parent is a barber, so suggesting barber school was practical. The son agreed to it, so maybe the parent's approach was effective but maybe unnecessarily harsh. \n\nIn some cases, cutting off support can be a parent's choice, but using a homeless shelter might be seen as using a system meant for the homeless rather than finding another temporary solution. The parent could have considered other options like finding a place for the son to stay temporarily or helping him find a job. However, given the son's history of not taking responsibility, the parent might have felt it was necessary to push him to independence. \n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there might be ethical concerns. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but the reasoning is nuanced. The parent's actions, while harsh, led to the son's success and were within their rights. The question of whether it's the best approach is separate from being in the wrong.\n"
