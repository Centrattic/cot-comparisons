This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried to push him into trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. He worked a few short-term jobs and then stopped. The parent sold the house, moved away, and when the house was sold, took the son to the shelter. The son later went to barber school at the parent's suggestion and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, sending an adult to a homeless shelter might have legal implications. Homeless shelters typically accept individuals who are actually homeless. If the son was living with the parent and then sent to the shelter without being homeless, that could be an issue. The parent might be using the shelter in a way that's not intended.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The parent's intention was to force the son to become independent, which is a common concern for adult children not contributing. But using a homeless shelter as a means to that end seems harsh. There might be other ways to encourage independence, like setting clear boundaries, cutting off financial support, or requiring the son to move out without external intervention. Sending someone to a shelter could be seen as a form of abandonment or even abuse, especially if the son wasn't truly homeless.\n\nThe parent mentions the son eventually became a barber and is living on his own. That's a positive outcome, but the method used raises questions. The parent might have crossed a line by involving a homeless shelter when the son wasn't in immediate danger or homeless. It's possible the parent could have found other solutions, like helping the son find temporary housing or setting up a structured move-out plan.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the son is a factor. Being sent to a shelter without warning could be traumatic. The parent might have wanted to avoid conflict, but this action could damage the parent-child relationship. The fact that the son later begged to move back suggests that the approach might have been too extreme.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while parents often struggle with adult children not taking responsibility, using a homeless shelter is not a typical or recommended strategy. Most advice suggests communication, setting boundaries, and gradual independence rather than sudden and drastic measures.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the parent's action might be legally permissible since the son is an adult, but ethically, it's questionable. The method was extreme and potentially harmful. There were likely better, more constructive ways to encourage independence without resorting to a homeless shelter. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
