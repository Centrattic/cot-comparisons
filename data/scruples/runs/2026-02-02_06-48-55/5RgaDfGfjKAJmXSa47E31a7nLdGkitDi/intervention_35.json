This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. The parent's son was 23, not working consistently, and the parent felt guilty. The parent tried to push the son into a trade school, but he only stuck with a bartending job for six months. After selling the house, the parent sent him to a shelter when he didn't move out. The son later went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent did set a firm boundary by selling the house and giving the son an ultimatum. When the son didn't move out, the parent took him to the shelter. The parent's intention was to force independence. However, using a homeless shelter as a means to an end might be questionable. Are there other resources or support systems that could have been utilized first? \n\nOn the other hand, the son was an adult, so the parent might not have a legal obligation to support him. The parent's actions could be seen as a harsh but necessary measure to push the son toward responsibility. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter, even if they're an adult, might be considered inhumane or extreme. It could also be seen as a last resort when other options were not explored. The parent mentions they tried to get him into trade school and offered conditions for moving back in, but maybe alternatives like temporary housing, counseling, or job training could have been considered before the shelter.\n\nThe parent's guilt suggests they felt conflicted about their decision. The son eventually changed his behavior after being sent to the shelter, which might indicate the approach worked. But the method's harshness could be debated. The key points are whether the parent had other options and if the action was proportionate to the situation. \n\nIn some cases, parents might use strict measures to push independence, but using a homeless shelter might be pushing too far, especially if there's a risk of harm or if the shelter's conditions are not suitable. However, the parent's intent was to help the son grow, and the outcome was positive. It's a balance between tough love and potential harm. \n\nI think the answer depends on societal norms and what's considered acceptable. If the parent had tried all other avenues and the shelter was the only option left, maybe it's justified. But if there were other resources available, maybe not. Since the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong, and considering the son was an adult, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to support him indefinitely. However, using a homeless shelter might be seen as cruel. But given the outcome and the parent's intent, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. Alternatively, there might be a better way, but the parent's choice could be justified as a necessary action for the son's growth.\n"
