This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who took their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the son wasn't a minor anymore. At 23, he's an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The parent tried multiple times to help him get a job and into trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. The son was living at home, not working consistently, and contributing nothing. The parent felt they had to set a boundary, so they sold the house and moved away, which forced the son to move out. When the shelter's beds were full, the parent waited until there was an opening and sent him there. \n\nNow, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is a strong action. But considering the parent's attempts to help him before, like suggesting trade school and eventually requiring him to go to barber school, it seems like the parent wanted to push him to become independent. The son eventually found a job and is living on his own now. \n\nBut wait, is there a better way to handle this? Maybe the parent could have offered some other support or found alternative housing. However, the parent's goal was to force independence, and they didn't want to enable the son's inactive lifestyle. The parent's actions, while harsh, might be justified if the son needed a wake-up call. \n\nThe parent didn't just kick him out; they followed through on a threat they had mentioned earlier. The son didn't resist, suggesting he knew this was coming. Also, the parent provided a specific condition for him to come back, which he met. \n\nOn the other hand, using a homeless shelter might have been traumatic for the son and could be seen as an extreme measure. Other parents might have different approaches, but in this case, the outcome was positive. The parent's intent was to help the son become self-sufficient, which is a valid goal. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's actions, though extreme, were aimed at encouraging independence. The son is now successful, so the method worked, even if it was harsh. The parent isn't in the wrong here because they were trying to help their adult child become responsible. So the answer is B.\n"
