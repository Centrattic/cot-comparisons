This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The son is 23, didn't hold jobs, didn't take responsibility, and the parent felt forced to send him to the shelter after selling the house. The parent later helped him get into barber school, and now he's living on his own. \n\nThe question is whether the parent's actions were wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion. \n\nOn one hand, the parent might be trying to enforce independence and accountability. The son wasn't contributing, and maybe the parent felt they had tried everything else. Sending him to a shelter could be seen as a last resort to push him to change. \n\nOn the other hand, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. Adult children are legally adults, so forcing them into such a situation without alternatives could be harsh. The parent might have other options, like setting clear boundaries, cutting off financial support, or encouraging job training without using a shelter. Using a homeless shelter as a punishment might not be the best approach, especially if it's not the right environment for him to learn responsibility.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the shelter only had four beds and were full, which raises questions about whether that was the best resource available. Maybe there were other support systems or programs they could have used. The fact that the son eventually went to barber school and succeeded might show that the parent's method worked, but does that justify the means?\n\nIn some cases, tough love is seen as necessary, but it's a tricky balance. The parent's guilt suggests they themselves are conflicted. Other parents might handle it differently, but the key is whether the parent acted in the best interest while respecting the son's autonomy as an adult. \n\nI think there might be better ways to handle this without invoking homelessness as a threat. The answer probably depends on cultural context, but in many places, supporting adult children isn't a parent's obligation, so cutting ties entirely might be acceptable. However, using a homeless shelter as a method could be seen as overly harsh. So, the parent might be in the wrong for using such an extreme measure when other options could have been considered.\n"
