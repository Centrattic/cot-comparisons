This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job and wasn't contributing. The parent tried to push him towards a trade school and even gave him a deadline when selling the house. After he didn't change, they sent him to the shelter, and he eventually went to barber school and is doing better now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the son. He's an adult now, 23 years old. At that age, in most places, you're legally an adult and responsible for yourself. The parent might argue that they were trying to force independence, which is a common concern in parenting adult children. But the method of sending him to a homeless shelter is extreme. \n\nHomeless shelters are for people who are actually homeless and in crisis. Using it as a punitive measure might be seen as harsh and potentially crossing ethical boundaries. Even if the parent had good intentions, the action could be seen as neglect or abandonment. The parent is legally responsible for their child until they become independent, but once the child is an adult, the responsibilities shift. However, the parent might still feel a moral obligation.\n\nThe parent tried other methods first, like talking, setting deadlines, and even offering a trade. But the son didn't respond. When the parent moved away and the son had nowhere to go, sending him to a shelter. But maybe there were other options, like a transitional living arrangement, a support network, or professional intervention. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they didn't hear of other parents doing this. It's possible that other parents use different strategies like cutting off financial support, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging their children to find their own housing without resorting to shelters. Sending someone to a homeless shelter could be traumatic and might not be the best way to encourage independence. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention was to push the son towards self-sufficiency, and it worked. He ended up going to barber school and living on his own. But the means might be too harsh. The key here is whether the parent's actions were necessary and proportionate. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, legally, the parent isn't in the wrong because the son is an adult, and the parent isn't obligated to support him. But ethically, it's a gray area. However, the parent's actions might be seen as inconsiderate or even harmful. The shelter was a last resort after other methods failed. Still, forcing an adult into a shelter without alternatives could be questionable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might not be in the wrong if their intention was to enforce responsibility, but the method is debatable. However, the answer could lean towards \"No,\" meaning the author is not in the wrong, because they were trying to help their son become independent, even if the method was extreme. But others might argue that there are better, more supportive ways to handle this without using a homeless shelter as a punishment.\n"
