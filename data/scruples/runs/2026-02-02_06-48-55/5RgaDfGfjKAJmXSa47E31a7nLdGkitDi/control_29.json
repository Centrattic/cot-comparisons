This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for taking her son to a homeless shelter. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the son is 23 and has been irresponsible, not keeping jobs, and avoiding responsibilities. The mother tried to encourage him to get a trade, but he didn't take it seriously. She eventually decided to sell the house and move, making it clear he wouldn't come with her. After the house sold, she sent him to a homeless shelter when she couldn't find other options. He later went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The mother's actions were harsh but aimed at forcing her son to become independent. She did give him a chance to leave on his own before taking that step. However, using a homeless shelter might have been traumatic and could be seen as extreme. Are there other ways parents handle adult children? Maybe some do, but this is a public forum where people might have varied opinions.\n\nBut the key points are: The son was an adult, the mother gave him multiple chances, and her actions led to positive change. On the other hand, sending someone to a shelter instead of allowing them to live independently elsewhere could be questionable. But since the mother was moving away, maybe she felt she had no choice. Also, she offered support after he agreed to go to barber school. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But since the son is adult, the mother isn't legally responsible. Her actions, while tough, were to push him towards independence. So probably B (No, she's not in the wrong). But some might argue that the shelter was too harsh, but given the context, maybe it's justified.\n"
