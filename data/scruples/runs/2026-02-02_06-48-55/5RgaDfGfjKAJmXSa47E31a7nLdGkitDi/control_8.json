This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter. The situation is that the son was 23, didn't hold jobs, was irresponsible, and the parent eventually sent him to a shelter after selling the house. The son later went to barber school and is doing better now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is an adult, so legally, the parent isn't obligated to support him. But sending him to a homeless shelter might be a harsh method. Some might argue that the parent had the right to set boundaries, especially if the son wasn't contributing and the parent wanted to force independence. However, using a homeless shelter as a means to do that could be seen as extreme. There might be alternative steps like cutting financial support, setting conditions for living at home, or encouraging him to find a job without resorting to such a drastic measure.\n\nEthically, while the parent's intention was to help the son become self-sufficient, the method could be questioned. Homeless shelters are for people in immediate need, and using one as a motivational tactic might not be appropriate. It could be considered emotionally harmful, even if the outcome was positive. The son might have felt abandoned or shamed, which could affect their relationship long-term.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent did try to talk to the son for years, offer trade school suggestions, and finally took action after the house sale. The result was the son becoming a barber and living independently, which is a good outcome. The parent's actions led to a positive change, which might justify the harsh method in their eyes.\n\nBut is it the right approach? Other parents might use different strategies like setting clear expectations, withholding financial support, or requiring the son to find a job as a condition for living at home. Sending to a shelter is unusual and might be seen as a last resort, but the question is whether it was the wrong approach. The parent might have alternatives but didn't mention them, so it's hard to say. However, the intention was to help, and the outcome was positive, so maybe not in the wrong. But the method is questionable. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. In some views, it's a tough love approach, while others see it as neglect or abandonment. The shelter is for people in crisis, so using it as a consequence for not working might not be the best way. The parent could have been more wrong if there were other options, but since the son eventually improved, maybe not. It's a tough call. I think the answer is B (No), because the parent's intent was to help, even if the method was extreme. But some might argue A. However, in the context of the question, the parent's action led to the son's improvement, so maybe not in the wrong.\n"
