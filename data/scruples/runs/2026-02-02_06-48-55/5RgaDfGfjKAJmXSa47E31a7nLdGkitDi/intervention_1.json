This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe parent's son is 23, didn't hold jobs, spent time gaming, and wasn't contributing. The parent tried to encourage him to go to trade school but he didn't take it seriously. After years of this, the parent sells the house and moves away, leading to sending the son to a shelter when the house is sold. Eventually, the son goes to barber school and becomes independent.\n\nFirst, the parent might feel they're doing what's necessary for the son's growth. They wanted to push him to become self-sufficient. But sending someone to a shelter is drastic. Are there other options? Like cutting financial support, setting clear boundaries, or helping him find jobs? Maybe the parent could have allowed him to stay but with conditions, like paying rent or working. The shelter option might have been a shock tactic to make him realize the consequences, but it's harsh. Also, the parent's method of \"throwing his stuff in the car\" could be seen as abrupt. However, the outcome was positive\u2014the son did change. But does the end justify the means? Some might argue that using a homeless shelter is too extreme and not the parent's responsibility. Others might think it's a necessary step after years of inaction. Also, the parent's guilt suggests they're conflicted. Legally, parents aren't required to support adult children, but emotionally, it's a gray area. The key points are: the son was an adult, the parent gave multiple chances, but the method used was harsh. So, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. The parent might not be in the wrong if they believe they're helping the son learn responsibility, but the method could be questionable. Maybe there were less extreme ways to achieve the same result without involving a shelter. Also, the parent's own guilt indicates they feel it was extreme. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because sending to a shelter could be seen as overly harsh, especially if there were alternatives. But others might say the parent did what was necessary. The community's perspective, like in AITA threads, often looks at intent and alternatives. Since the parent didn't try other methods like cutting off financial support first, maybe they are in the wrong.\n"
