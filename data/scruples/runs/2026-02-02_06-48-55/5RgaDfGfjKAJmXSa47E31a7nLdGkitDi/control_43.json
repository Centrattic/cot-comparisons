This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter. \n\nFirst, the key points: The son is 23, didn't take jobs seriously, wouldn't get a job, and the mother felt she had to take drastic measures. She sold the house, moved away, and finally sent him to a homeless shelter when he didn't change. The son later went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, once someone is 18, they are legally adults. Parents aren't obligated to support their adult children financially. So, the mother isn't legally wrong. However, sending an adult to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, but she did it to force independence. \n\nEthically, some might argue that using a homeless shelter as a consequence is extreme, especially if there are other options like moving out with friends or family, or other support systems. But the mother might not have had those options or felt they wouldn't work. The son's response was to eventually get a job, so maybe it worked. \n\nOther parents might handle it differently, but the question is whether she was wrong. If she was the one providing financial support, cutting it off is her right. The action was tough love, but maybe it was necessary in her situation. The mother also tried to help him by suggesting a trade school and setting conditions for moving back in. \n\nPotential issues: Did she have other options? If the son had nowhere else to go, maybe the shelter was the only choice. Also, was there a better way to encourage him without using a shelter? But the mother's intention was to make him self-sufficient, and she succeeded in the end. \n\nOverall, the mother's actions, while extreme, might be justified given the circumstances. The son is now better off, and parents aren't required to house their adult children indefinitely. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there are any legal aspects where she could be liable, but I don't think so. Adult children can be asked to leave, and shelters are for those in need. She might have done it for the right reasons. So Answer B.\n"
