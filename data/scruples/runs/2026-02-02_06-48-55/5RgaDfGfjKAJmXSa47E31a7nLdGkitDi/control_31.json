This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent felt guilty but thought it was necessary to push the son to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of the son. At 23, he's an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, the parent was still providing a home and support, which is common in some families. The key issue here is whether the method used was appropriate.\n\nThe parent tried various ways to encourage the son to get a job and take responsibility. They suggested trade schools, and the son tried bartending and other short-term jobs. The parent eventually decided to move away and then sent him to a homeless shelter when he didn't make changes. The son later went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions. Sending someone to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. It could be seen as a way to enforce independence, but it's also quite harsh. There might be other ways to handle it, like giving him an ultimatum to leave the house with some support, or setting boundaries that require him to contribute. However, the parent did try multiple times to talk to the son and give him chances.\n\nThe son's behavior was problematic. He wasn't taking responsibility, which is a valid concern for any parent. The parent's goal was to make him self-sufficient, which is a reasonable expectation. But the method used\u2014homeless shelter\u2014might have been extreme. Some might argue that it's a form of emotional manipulation or neglect, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent did offer help later by suggesting barber school, which led to the son getting a job. The parent's actions ultimately worked, but the question is whether it was the right approach. Other parents might use different methods, like setting clear deadlines or providing structured support. The parent might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce independence, but the method could be questioned.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action was justified. While the parent's intention was good, the means were harsh. However, since the son is an adult, the parent isn't legally wrong, and some might see it as a necessary tough love approach. Others might think it was too extreme. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the outcome and the parent's efforts, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But there's a debate here. However, the key is that the parent did take action after trying other methods and the son is now better. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
