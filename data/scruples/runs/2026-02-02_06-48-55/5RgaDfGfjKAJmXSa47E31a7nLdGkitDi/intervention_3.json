This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did the right thing by sending their son to a homeless shelter. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe mom's son is 23, and she's been trying to get him to get a job and learn a trade for years. He wasn't college material, she said, but she encouraged him to go to trade school. He worked a few short-term jobs, like bartending, but they didn't last. When the mom decided to sell the house and move, she told him he wasn't coming, and eventually sent him to a shelter. After that, he went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was wrong to send him to the shelter. The user thinks she was wrong, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, let's look at the mom's perspective. She tried talking to him, setting boundaries, and even offered a trade school idea. When he didn't change, she took drastic action to force independence. She might believe that this was necessary for his growth, even if it was harsh. She did call the shelter every day to get a spot, indicating she was trying to find a safe place for him. Afterward, she allowed him to come back on the condition he became a barber, which he did. So maybe she saw this as a last resort to push him out of his comfort zone.\n\nOn the other hand, sending a family member to a homeless shelter is an extreme measure. It might have been traumatic for the son, even if he didn't show it. Homeless shelters are for people in real need, and using it as a disciplinary action could be seen as cruel. Also, were there other options? Maybe a support system, like a rehab program or counseling, that could have helped him without such a harsh step? She mentions not knowing other parents who do this, which might suggest it's an unusual approach.\n\nBut then again, the son was an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, and the mom might feel she can't be held responsible forever. If he wasn't contributing and refused to take responsibility, her action could be seen as a way to enforce independence. However, the method is questionable. Alternatives like putting him on his own with a strict agreement (no support unless he meets certain conditions) might have been less drastic. \n\nAlso, the shelter's purpose is to help homeless people, not to punish people for not meeting their parents' expectations. Even if the son had a place to stay, the emotional impact of being sent to a shelter could be significant. It's possible that this action caused more harm than good, even if it eventually led to positive change.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most parents try other methods first, like setting up financial independence, cutting off support, or encouraging rehab programs. Sending to a shelter is not a typical approach and could be viewed as an overreaction, even if the outcome was positive. The mom might have crossed a line by using a homeless shelter as a means of discipline rather than a genuine need for shelter.\n\nBut the key here is whether she was wrong. If the intent was to help him become independent, but the method was excessive, then maybe she's in the wrong. However, if the shelter was the only option available and she had tried everything else, it's a toss-up. The fact that she had tried other avenues (talking, offering trade school, setting conditions) supports her trying to help, but the use of a homeless shelter as a disciplinary action is the controversial part.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because using a homeless shelter in this context, while aiming for independence, is an extreme and potentially harmful action that isn't typically considered a responsible or compassionate approach. There might have been other, less drastic methods to encourage her son's independence without resorting to such a harsh measure.\n"
