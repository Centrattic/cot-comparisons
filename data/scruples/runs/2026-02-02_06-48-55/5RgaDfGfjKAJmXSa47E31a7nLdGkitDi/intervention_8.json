This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding down jobs, being unproductive, and the mom felt guilty about the action.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The son is an adult, so the parent's responsibility might be different compared to a minor. The mom tried to encourage him to get a trade school or a skill, which is reasonable. He worked a few jobs but didn't stick with them. When the mom decided to move and couldn't take him, she sent him to the shelter. He eventually went to barber school and is now doing better.\n\nThe key points here: the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The mom tried various methods to help him become independent but he wasn't responding. She felt that sending him to the shelter was a last resort to force him to take responsibility. The shelter had limited beds, and it was the only way she could make him leave. The son didn't protest, indicating he might have known it was coming.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: Maybe the shelter isn't the right place for someone who isn't homeless. The mom could have found other alternatives, like letting him live with friends or family, or setting different conditions. Also, using a homeless shelter might have been a harsh measure that could have been avoided with more support or different strategies.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom was trying to push her son to become independent, which is a valid concern. She tried multiple approaches over years and felt that this extreme step was necessary. The son eventually improved, so maybe the method was effective even if it was tough. The shelter provided a temporary solution until he could get on his feet, which might be seen as a way to motivate him without leaving him completely homeless.\n\nI should consider societal norms and typical parenting approaches. Some might argue that the shelter was too extreme, but others might see it as the only way to break the cycle. The son's reaction (not arguing) suggests he might have been aware of his responsibilities. The mom's intention was to help him, even though the method was harsh. The outcome is positive, so maybe the ends justified the means in her eyes.\n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have a responsibility to their child's well-being, but when the child is an adult, that responsibility might be balanced with encouraging independence. The shelter might have been a way to create a sense of urgency. However, alternatives could have been explored, like discussing the situation more openly, setting up a structured move-out plan, or connecting him with other support services.\n\nThe question is whether the action was proportionate. The author might not be in the wrong if they were trying to force independence, but if there were other less drastic methods available, maybe they could have been used. The fact that the mom offered a condition (barber school) after he was in the shelter might show she still wanted to help, but the initial action was severe.\n\nI think it depends on the context. Since the son was an adult and the mom was trying to move away, she needed to set boundaries. However, using a homeless shelter might be seen as unnecessary if he wasn't actually homeless. The right answer might be a balance. But the options are A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to evaluate.\n\nIf the author's intention was to help the son become independent by forcing him into a situation where he had to find a job, maybe it's a tough love approach. But if the son had no other options and it put him in a vulnerable place, maybe it's not the best approach. The shelter's limited beds might not have been a genuine need, just a way to make him leave. So, the author might be in the wrong for using the shelter in a non-emergency context. Alternatively, if the son was aware of the consequences and the shelter was a temporary step, then maybe not. The community's opinion on AITA often considers intent and alternatives. If the parent didn't explore all possibilities and resorted to an extreme measure, they might be AITA. If they tried everything and it was the last option, then B. Given that the mom tried multiple jobs and trade school suggestions over years, and the shelter was a way to enforce moving out, maybe B is the answer. The key is that the son was an adult, and the parent was trying to push him towards independence, even if the method was harsh. The outcome was positive, so maybe it's not the author's fault. But I need to check if there were other options. The post mentions she called every day until a spot opened, implying that the shelter was the only way she could make him leave. If there were no other options, then perhaps it's not the parent's fault. However, using a homeless shelter might be an inhumane way, even if the intention was good. So, the answer might be A or B. The community often gives a 'No' to AITA when the parent is trying to help an adult child become independent, even with tough methods. So, maybe B is the answer here.\n"
