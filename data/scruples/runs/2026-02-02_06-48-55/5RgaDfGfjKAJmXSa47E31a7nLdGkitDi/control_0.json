This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe parent's son was 23, didn't hold down jobs, spent a lot of time gaming and hanging out with friends, and wasn't contributing. The parent tried to push him towards trade school but he didn't follow through. When the parent decided to move, they gave the son an ultimatum. After the house sold, the parent took the son to a homeless shelter. Eventually, the son went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions. The key points here are that the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, so the parent isn't obligated to support him. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. The parent's intention was to force independence, which is understandable, but the method might be questionable.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe giving the son more time, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging him through other means like job training programs. Also, the parent might not have considered other support systems or transitional housing options. The parent's action, while harsh, did lead to the son becoming self-sufficient, which is a positive outcome.\n\nBut the question is about whether the parent is in the wrong. In terms of legal rights, the parent isn't in the wrong because they aren't legally required to support an adult child. Ethically, it's more complex. Some might argue that the parent went too far, while others might see it as a necessary step for the son's growth.\n\nThe parent did give some options, like attending barber school, and the son eventually took responsibility. However, the use of a homeless shelter as a tactic is controversial. It's possible that the parent could have found a less drastic way to encourage independence without exposing their son to homelessness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions were to help the son become independent, the method used might be considered too harsh. So, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) or B (they are not). But given the son's eventual success and the parent's intent to help, maybe the answer leans towards B. However, the extreme measure of using a homeless shelter might tip it towards A. But I need to check if there's a consensus on such actions. In some cases, similar situations are debated, but often the parent is seen as doing what's necessary. So, maybe B is the answer here.\n"
