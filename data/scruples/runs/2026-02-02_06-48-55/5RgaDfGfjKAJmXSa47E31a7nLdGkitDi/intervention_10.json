This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the son was 23, which is an adult. The parent mentions he didn't contribute, quit jobs, and wasn't taking responsibility. The parent tried to help by suggesting trade schools and moving away to push him out. But sending him to a homeless shelter seems extreme. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The parent's intention was to make the son responsible, which is a common parenting challenge. However, using a homeless shelter might not be the best approach. Homeless shelters are for people in immediate need, not as a disciplinary measure. It could be seen as cruel or inhumane, even if the parent's goal was to force independence. \n\nAlso, the parent later allowed the son to move back if he went to barber school. The son did that and is now living independently. So there was a way to help without using a shelter. Maybe there were other options like a rehab center, transitional housing, or a supportive program. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent had tried other methods over the years without success. The son didn't respond to warnings, so the parent felt it was the only way. But is sending an adult to a homeless shelter ever appropriate as a parenting tactic? It might be crossing a line, even if the outcome was positive. \n\nI think the parent's method was harsh, but the intention was to help the son become self-sufficient. However, using a homeless shelter as a punishment might not be the right approach. There's a thin line between tough love and neglect. The parent could have explored other resources or sought professional help before resorting to such a drastic step. \n\nSo, considering all that, I believe the parent is in the wrong (A) because sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is an extreme measure that could cause emotional harm. There might be other ways to encourage independence without such punitive actions.\n"
