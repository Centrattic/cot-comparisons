This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the son was 23, which is an adult. The parent tried various ways to encourage him to get a job and pursue a trade, like bartending and other short-term jobs, but he kept quitting or getting fired. The parent eventually sold their house and moved, leaving the son without a place to live. When the house sold, they took him to a homeless shelter. The son later went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions. They did give the son multiple chances to get on track, including suggesting trade schools and setting a deadline by moving. When that didn't work, they took drastic action. The parent's intention seems to be to force independence. But is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter appropriate? \n\nThere are arguments both ways. On one hand, the parent might feel they've done everything possible and need to protect their own life. On the other, a homeless shelter is a last resort and might be seen as harsh, even if the son is an adult. However, the parent didn't abandon him entirely\u2014they called the shelter, found a spot, and later allowed him to come back under conditions. The son eventually succeeded after this intervention.\n\nOther possibilities could be cutting off financial support or evicting him from the house without the shelter step. But the parent's method worked in the end. The key here is that the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. While the action was extreme, it might be seen as a necessary measure to push responsibility. However, some might argue that the parent could have explored other options first, like legal eviction processes or more structured support. Still, given the context of repeated failures and the parent's efforts, the answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong.\n"
