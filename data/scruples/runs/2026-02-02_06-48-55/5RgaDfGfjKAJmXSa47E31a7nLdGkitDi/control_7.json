This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The story is about a parent sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent felt guilty but did it to push the son to change. The son eventually went to barber school and is doing better now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the son. At 23, he's an adult, so the parent might feel they've done their duty in raising him. But the approach here was quite drastic. Sending someone to a homeless shelter is a severe measure. Is there a more supportive way to handle this?\n\nThe parent mentions trying to talk to the son about getting a job and even suggesting trade schools. The son didn't take the advice and kept avoiding responsibility. The parent tried selling the house to force the son to move out, which led to the shelter situation. \n\nBut here's the thing: even though the son was an adult, the parent is still his guardian. Forcing him into a homeless shelter might have been harsh. Homeless shelters are for people in immediate need, and using it as a wake-up call could be seen as using a tool not meant for that purpose. It could be considered emotionally abusive or manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention was to make the son take responsibility. The son did eventually change, so the outcome was positive. But the method might have crossed a line. Other alternatives could have been cutting off financial support, encouraging him to move out gradually, or seeking professional help. \n\nAlso, the parent's guilt suggests they might have felt it was necessary but painful. However, the act of sending a family member to a shelter without their consent is a big step. It's possible that the parent's actions were justified in their eyes, but society might view that as overstepping. \n\nI should check if there are any ethical or legal issues here. Legally, once someone is an adult, parents can't force them to do anything without consent. But taking them to a shelter without their agreement might be seen as coercion. Ethically, it's about respect for autonomy versus responsibility. \n\nIn some cases, tough love is used, but the line between tough love and abuse can be thin. The parent might not be wrong, but their approach was extreme. There's no clear right answer, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's actions were harsh but came from a place of wanting the son to take responsibility. However, using a homeless shelter as a method might not be the right approach. The answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) being the parent's actions were too extreme, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
