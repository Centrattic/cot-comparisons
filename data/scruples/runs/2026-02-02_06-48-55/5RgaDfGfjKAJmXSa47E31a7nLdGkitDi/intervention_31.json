This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried to encourage their son to get a job and go to trade school, but he kept failing to hold jobs. Eventually, the parent sold their house, moved away, and sent the son to a shelter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, the parent's actions might be seen as harsh. Using a homeless shelter as a wake-up call could be seen as a last resort. The parent might have other options, like cutting off financial support without using the shelter. \n\nThe son's behavior is problematic\u2014he's not taking responsibility, but the parent's method might not be the best approach. Sending someone to a homeless shelter can be traumatic and might not be the most constructive way to push independence. There could be better methods, like setting clear boundaries without involving external institutions. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own. So, maybe the parent's actions had the desired effect, but the question is whether the method was wrong. \n\nOthers might argue that the parent is justified in trying to force independence, especially if they've exhausted other methods. However, the use of a homeless shelter might be seen as excessive or emotionally manipulative. It's a tough call because it's a personal family matter, but there's a line between discipline and cruelty.\n\nI think the key points are the son's age, the parent's prior attempts to help, and the effectiveness versus the method used. The parent might not be in the wrong legally or morally if their intention was to push independence, but ethically, using a homeless shelter could be questionable. However, since the son is an adult, the parent's responsibility is less, so B (not in the wrong) might be the answer.\n"
