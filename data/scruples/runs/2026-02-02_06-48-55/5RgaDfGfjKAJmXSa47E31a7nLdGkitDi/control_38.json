This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking her son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe son is 23, and the mom describes him as someone who just wanted to lay around, play video games, and didn't keep jobs. She tried to encourage him to go to trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. He worked as a bartender for six months but then quit other jobs quickly. The mom decided to sell the house and move away, not taking him with her. She tried to find a shelter for him, which was difficult, but eventually found a spot. She sent him there, and later he agreed to go to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult. Parents are not legally obligated to support adult children unless there's a disability or other specific circumstances. So the mom isn't in the wrong legally by not letting him stay with her. But the ethical or social aspect is trickier. \n\nThe mom's approach was harsh. Using a homeless shelter as a last resort might have been a shock tactic to push her son into independence. But is that the right way? Other parents might handle it by setting boundaries without sending their kids to shelters. Maybe a more gradual approach, like giving an ultimatum to leave with a certain amount of time to find his own place and support himself, or cutting off financial support. \n\nHowever, the son's behavior was concerning. Not working, not contributing, and being manipulative. The mom had exhausted other options and tried to encourage him to get a trade. The shelter was a way to force him to take action. The outcome was positive; he went to barber school and is living on his own now. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The mom's intent was to help her son become self-sufficient. The method was extreme but might have been effective. The question is whether there was a better way. Critics might say using the shelter could have been degrading or unnecessary. Supporters might argue that it was a necessary tough love to break the cycle of dependency.\n\nI should also consider if the shelter was the right place. Sometimes shelters have resources or programs that can help, but in this case, the mom might have thought it would motivate him. Also, the son didn't fight her decision, maybe because he realized she was serious. But was there a better way, like a structured plan with support but not shelter? Maybe, but the mom might not have other options. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the action was done out of love and the son needed to learn responsibility, then she might not be in the wrong. However, if there were other options that could have been tried first, maybe she's partly responsible. But given the son's history, the mom could have felt that this was the only way to make him take life seriously. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she was trying to enforce independence on an adult child who wasn't taking steps to become responsible. The method was extreme but her intention was to help him, and it worked. Other parents might use different methods, but that doesn't mean she's wrong.\n"
