This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son wasn't working, was using the house, contributing nothing, and the parent felt they had to push him to become independent. The parent tried other methods like suggesting trade school, but the son wasn't cooperative. Eventually, when the parent moved, they sent him to the shelter as a last resort.\n\nI should think about the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult. Parents aren't legally obligated to support their adult children unless there's a specific agreement or dependency. So, the parent might have a right to set boundaries. However, taking him to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh, but the parent's intention was to force independence.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The parent did try to help the son in other ways before this. The shelter was a last resort after selling the house. The outcome was positive; the son went to barber school and is now independent. But sending an adult to a shelter could have been traumatic. \n\nI need to consider if there were other options. Maybe the parent could have involved social services or found alternative living arrangements. But the parent might have felt that the shelter was the only way to make the son take action. Also, the parent allowed the son to come back under the condition of attending barber school, which shows they still cared and wanted to help.\n\nPublic opinion on AITA threads often looks at intent and outcomes. The parent's intent was to push the son towards independence, which is a valid goal. The outcome was positive. However, the method might be seen as extreme. But given the son's behavior and the parent's previous attempts, maybe it's justified.\n\nI should also consider if the parent had other responsibilities. The parent moved away, perhaps for their own reasons, and couldn't support the son financially anymore. The shelter was a way to enforce responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method was harsh, the parent's actions were aimed at promoting independence after multiple failed attempts. The son is now better off. So the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
