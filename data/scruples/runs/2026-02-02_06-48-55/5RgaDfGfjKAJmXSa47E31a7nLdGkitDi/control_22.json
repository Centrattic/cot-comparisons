This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post did the right thing by sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. The key points here are the son's behavior: not working consistently, being uncooperative when told to get a job, and the mother's decision to take drastic action when she had to move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, once someone is an adult (18+), they have the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions are unwise. The mother might feel she's helping by pushing him out, but legally, she's not obligated to support him. However, forcing him into a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh. Homelessness is a serious issue, and using it as a measure might have psychological impacts.\n\nNext, the mother's intent. She wanted to push him to become independent. She did give him opportunities to get a trade, like suggesting barber school. But sending him to a shelter after he didn't take action might be seen as a last resort. However, there might be other ways to encourage independence without such a drastic step. For example, setting conditions for support, like requiring him to work or attend school before offering help.\n\nThen, the outcome. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own. That's a positive outcome, but the method used to get there is questionable. Some might argue that the mother's actions were necessary to break his cycle of dependency, while others might think it was inconsiderate and could have long-term negative effects on their relationship.\n\nAlso, the lack of alternative support systems. The mother mentioned calling the shelter daily until a spot opened, which shows she tried alternatives. But maybe there were other community resources, temporary housing, or support programs that could have been explored. Sending someone to a homeless shelter can be traumatic, even if the intent is to teach a lesson.\n\nConsidering societal norms, while some parents might have strict rules, using a homeless shelter as a consequence is uncommon. It's possible that other parents use different strategies, like cutting off financial support or setting clear boundaries without extreme measures. The harshness of the action might be seen as disproportionate to the problem, especially if the son hadn't committed any illegal acts.\n\nIn summary, the mother's actions, while possibly motivated by a desire to help her son become self-sufficient, might be considered excessive. There could be better, less traumatic methods to encourage independence. The answer would depend on societal values around parental responsibility and the ethical implications of using homelessness as a wake-up call.\n"
