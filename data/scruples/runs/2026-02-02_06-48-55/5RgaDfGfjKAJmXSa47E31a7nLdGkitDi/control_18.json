This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. The parent has a history of trying to get their son to take responsibility, setting up trade school options, and eventually deciding to move away. The son wasn't working, was irresponsible, and the parent felt they had to take drastic action to force independence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, once a child turns 18, they're considered adults, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support them. The son here was 23, so the parent isn't breaking any laws by making him leave. However, the use of a homeless shelter as a measure might raise ethical questions. Was it necessary? Could there have been other options?\n\nThe parent tried various methods: talking, suggesting trade schools, allowing the son to work some jobs but not for long. When those didn't work, they decided to sell the house and move, but the son didn't change his behavior. The parent then resorted to sending him to a shelter. The argument here is that the parent wanted to teach responsibility, and maybe the son needed a harsh wake-up call.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as too extreme. The son might have been in a vulnerable position, and the parent could have explored other avenues like transitional housing, support groups, or counseling. The parent's approach might be harsh, but the intention was to force independence. The son eventually did take steps to improve by going to barber school, which suggests the method worked in the end. But was there a better way?\n\nThe parent's actions might be seen as necessary given the circumstances, especially if the son wasn't self-sufficient and the parent was trying to break the cycle of dependency. However, the use of a homeless shelter could be seen as a last resort and maybe not the most compassionate approach. The answer hinges on whether the parent's actions, while tough, were justified in the context of their long-term goal for the son's independence. The parent did offer support after the son changed, allowing him to come back under conditions. So, considering all factors, the parent might not be in the wrong, so the answer would be B.\n"
