This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother was wrong to send her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't working. First, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe mother tried multiple times to encourage her son to get a job and pursue a trade. She gave him opportunities, like suggesting trade school, and even tried to set boundaries by moving away. When he continued to not take responsibility, she took a drastic step by sending him to a shelter. Her intention was to force him to become independent. \n\nOn the other hand, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. At 23, he's an adult, so maybe he should be responsible for himself. But was the shelter the best option? Alternatives like letting him stay in her house with strict conditions, helping him find temporary housing, or involving other support systems could have been considered. However, the mother felt that if she let him stay, he'd continue to depend on her.\n\nThe son eventually went to barber school and became independent, which might show that the mother's actions had a positive outcome. But the method was harsh. The key here is whether the action was necessary. Since the son was an adult, the mother wasn't legally obligated to support him, but the emotional and moral aspect is complex. \n\nOther parents might handle it differently, but there's no clear right or wrong answer. The mother's actions were extreme, but her intention was to help her son become self-sufficient. Whether she was in the wrong depends on whether the shelter was the only option and if there were less harsh alternatives. However, given the son's lack of progress despite multiple chances, the mother might believe it was necessary. The answer could be a mix, but typically, in these situations, the parent's intention to encourage independence is seen as justified, even if the method is harsh. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong), but some might argue A because of the extreme action. I need to decide based on the context given.\n"
