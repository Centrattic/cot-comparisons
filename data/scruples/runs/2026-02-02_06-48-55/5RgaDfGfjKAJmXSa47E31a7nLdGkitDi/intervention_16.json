This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter. The options are A for Yes or B for No.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The son is 23, not a child anymore. The parent tried to encourage him to get a job or go to trade school. The son didn't take the advice seriously, had short-term jobs, and didn't contribute much at home. The parent eventually sold their house and moved away, then sent the son to a homeless shelter after he didn't make changes. The son later went to barber school and is now independent.\n\nNow, the key points here: The son is an adult, so legally and in terms of responsibility, he should be making his own decisions. The parent's actions might be seen as extreme because sending someone to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. However, the parent might argue they were trying to force independence. \n\nBut here's the thing: Even though the parent's intention was to help, using a homeless shelter could be considered harsh. There might be other ways to encourage independence, like cutting off financial support, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging him to find his own place. The parent could have been more involved in helping him find resources or job opportunities instead of resorting to a shelter. Also, not all parents have to do this; there are other methods, which the parent acknowledges by saying they haven't heard of other parents doing the same.\n\nAnother angle: The parent might have felt desperate given the son's lack of progress. But the action itself, while possibly effective in the end, is quite extreme. The son did eventually take the advice to go to barber school, so maybe the parent's actions had the desired effect. However, the method used could be questioned in terms of ethics and the parent's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, society often expects parents to give their adult children a chance to stand on their own, but using a homeless shelter as a tactic is a big step. It might be seen as pushing the son into a vulnerable situation rather than offering support. The parent might have crossed a line by leveraging the threat of homelessness to force compliance, which could be emotionally damaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent did show concern by offering to take him back under the condition he attends barber school. The outcome was positive, so maybe the parent's approach worked. But the method might still be questionable. The parent could be criticized for not trying other, less drastic measures first, like formal agreements, setting up a structured plan for independence, or seeking professional help if needed.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intention was to push their son towards independence, the method of sending him to a homeless shelter is extreme and might be considered in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
