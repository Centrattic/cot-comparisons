This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter. First, I need to consider the context. The son is 23, not a minor, and the parent has been trying to get him to take responsibility for years. The son wasn't working, was relying on his mom, and the parent felt they had to take drastic action to push him to change.\n\nThe parent's actions were to send him to a homeless shelter after selling the house. The son ended up going to barber school and became self-sufficient. The parent's intention was to make him independent, but the method was extreme. Now, the user is wondering if this was the right approach.\n\nI should think about the parent's options. Usually, parents might set boundaries, cut off financial support, or encourage their adult child to find a job. Sending someone to a homeless shelter is unusual and could be seen as harsh. However, the parent's goal was to force independence, and it worked in the end. But is the method acceptable?\n\nThere are ethical considerations. Adult children have rights, and using a homeless shelter as a last resort might be seen as punitive. Some might argue that the parent should have explored other avenues first, like offering structured support or formal assistance programs. Others might say that after years of inaction, this was a necessary step.\n\nAlso, the parent's emotional state is important. They felt guilty but believe it was for the son's good. The outcome was positive, but the process was traumatic. It's a balance between tough love and potential harm. The key points are the son's age, the parent's efforts over time, and the effectiveness of the action taken.\n"
