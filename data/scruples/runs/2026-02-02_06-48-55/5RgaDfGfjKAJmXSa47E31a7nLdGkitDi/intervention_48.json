This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The son is 23, doesn't hold a job, stays home, plays games, and refuses to get a job. The parent tried to encourage him into trade school, but he didn't follow through. The parent eventually sells the house, moves away, and sends the son to a shelter when the house sells. The son then goes to barber school and starts living on his own.\n\nThe parent is asking if this was the right approach. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong, but they want another perspective.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about parenting an adult child. The parent is dealing with an adult son who isn't fulfilling responsibilities. The parent tried to push him into a trade, but he didn't follow through. When the parent decided to move, they gave the son a deadline, but he still didn't act. The parent then sent him to a shelter as a last resort.\n\nIn many cultures, once a child reaches adulthood, parents are not legally responsible for their care. However, the ethical aspect is more nuanced. The parent's actions were extreme\u2014using a homeless shelter as a \"wake-up call.\" While the parent's intention was to push the son towards independence, the method could be harsh. Homelessness is a serious issue, and using it as a parenting tool might be seen as cruel, even if the outcome was positive (son became a barber and is living on his own).\n\nBut the parent did give him a chance to leave before, by selling the house and moving. Maybe the parent's actions were a desperate measure after repeated failures. However, there could be more constructive ways to handle adult children's unemployment, like setting clear boundaries, offering support, or seeking professional help. Sending someone to a shelter, even if they need to learn responsibility, could be considered an overreaction. It's possible the parent's guilt and frustration led to an extreme action that might not be necessary for another person's growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might feel they had no other options and wanted to force responsibility. The son did eventually improve, so maybe the outcome justifies the means. But the question is whether the parent was in the wrong. Ethically, pushing someone into homelessness to teach a lesson is questionable. It's a form of punishment that could have lasting negative effects, even if the son later succeeded.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people might agree that the parent's actions were drastic. Other methods like cutting off financial support, encouraging job hunting, or involving other family members might be more constructive. However, since the parent is the one making the decision, and the son is an adult, the parent's responsibility isn't absolute. Still, using homelessness as a tool is a heavy-handed approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the parent might be in the wrong for using such an extreme measure. There are more supportive ways to encourage independence without subjecting someone to the harshness of a homeless shelter. Even if the son needed a harsh wake-up call, the method used could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
