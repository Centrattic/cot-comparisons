This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the mother sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. She felt guilty but thought it was necessary to push him to become independent. Now, she's asking if she did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, he's an adult. Legally, he's responsible for himself, so the mother isn't obligated to support him. However, as a parent, there's often a strong emotional and moral component. The mother tried to encourage him with trade school and jobs, but he didn't take it seriously. When she decided to move, she gave him an ultimatum, which he ignored. Then she sent him to the shelter. \n\nThe key points here are her intentions. She wanted him to learn responsibility. She didn't force him, but she made a tough decision. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. It could be seen as harsh, but maybe it was effective. He ended up going to barber school and is now independent. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that there could have been other ways to help him, like setting up a structured support system, finding him a job, or enrolling him in a program. The shelter was a last resort after years of inaction. But the mother's approach worked, even if it was extreme. \n\nAlso, the son didn't resist when she took him to the shelter, which suggests he knew it was coming. There's a part where she mentions he begged to come back under the condition of going to barber school, which he agreed to. That shows he had a chance to make a choice again. \n\nSo, the question is whether the method was wrong. If the goal was to force independence and she succeeded, does that make it right? Or is there a better, less harsh way? The mother felt guilt but believed it was necessary. The answer depends on whether the means justify the ends. Since he turned his life around, maybe she wasn't wrong. But others might say the method was too severe. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's rare for parents to use such drastic measures, but every family is different. The mother's actions were driven by a desire to help her son, even if it was tough love. Considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her intentions were to help her son become independent, and it worked, even if the method was harsh.\n"
