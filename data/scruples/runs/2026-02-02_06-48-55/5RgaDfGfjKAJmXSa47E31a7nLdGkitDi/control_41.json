This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is that the mother sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. She felt guilty but did it to push him to change. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the son. At 23, he's an adult, so legally, he's responsible for himself. However, the parent might still have emotional or moral responsibilities. The son wasn't working consistently, kept quitting jobs, and wasn't contributing. The mother gave him opportunities to get a trade, but he didn't take them seriously.\n\nThe action of sending him to a homeless shelter is drastic. Homeless shelters are for people in immediate need, facing homelessness. If the son wasn't homeless before, taking him there could be seen as punitive rather than supportive. It might be considered child neglect if the parent is the one who forced the situation. Also, taking an adult child to a shelter without their agreement could be against their autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's intention was to help him become independent. She tried talking, setting boundaries, and even moving away to push him out. After the shelter experience, he did change and got a job. So maybe the method was harsh but effective. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nLegally, if the son is an adult, the parent isn't obligated to support him. But taking him to a shelter might not be the right approach. Alternatives could include cutting off financial support, encouraging him to find his own place, or working with a counselor. Using a shelter as a punishment could be seen as harmful. Also, the mother mentioned the shelter had limited beds, which might mean she took advantage of the situation rather than ensuring his basic needs were met through other means.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the outcome was positive, the method was extreme. There might be better ways to enforce independence without using a homeless shelter. Other parents might have different strategies, but this action could be seen as overstepping, especially if the son wasn't in immediate danger of homelessness. The parent might be in the wrong for not considering other options and for potentially putting her son in a vulnerable situation unnecessarily.\n"
