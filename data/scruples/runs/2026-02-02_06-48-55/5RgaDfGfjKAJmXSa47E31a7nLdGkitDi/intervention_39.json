This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the mother) is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. I need to consider the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult, so the mother is not legally obligated to support him. He was 23 when this happened, so he's technically an adult. The mom mentions he wasn't working, was irresponsible, and she tried to push him into trade school. He kept getting jobs but wasn't holding them. \n\nThe mother decided to sell the house and move, not taking him with her. Then, when the house sold, she sent him to a homeless shelter because he wasn't making plans. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the mother was trying to force him to become independent, which is a parent's role. But sending him to a homeless shelter might be extreme. Alternatives could have been giving him an ultimatum to leave the house, cutting financial support, or encouraging him to move out. However, using a homeless shelter as a shock tactic might be harsh, especially if there were other options. Also, the shelter might not have been the right place for him; maybe he could have stayed with friends or had a different arrangement. \n\nThe son didn't resist, so maybe he was expecting it. But was it necessary? The mother felt guilty, which suggests she might have thought it was extreme. However, the outcome was positive\u2014he got a job and is independent now. \n\nIn many cases, parents handle adult children moving out by setting boundaries and giving them deadlines. Using a homeless shelter might not be the norm, but the key is whether the mother violated any laws or acted unreasonably. Since the son is an adult, the mother isn't breaking any laws by not supporting him. However, the emotional impact and the method used (homeless shelter) could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut considering the alternatives, maybe there's no \"better\" way. Some people might argue that the mother was justified in pushing him to independence. Others might say that using a homeless shelter was too extreme. The fact that the son eventually succeeded might support the mother's approach. \n\nI'm torn. On one side, she's doing what's necessary for his growth. On the other, the method might be too harsh. The answer could be either A or B depending on perspective. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to see if that's justified. \n\nIn many parenting forums, sending an adult child to a shelter isn't common, but it's not unheard of. The key is intent. The mother wanted to force independence, and while the method is extreme, the outcome was positive. However, the act of sending him to a shelter might not be in his best interest immediately. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's trying to enforce independence on an adult child, which is a parent's right. Even though the method is harsh, she's not legally wrong. Plus, the son is now doing well. But others might argue that there's a better way. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and she's not breaking any laws, the answer is B.\n"
