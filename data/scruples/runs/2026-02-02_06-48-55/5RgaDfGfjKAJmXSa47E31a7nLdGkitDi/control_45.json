This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The situation is that the son was 23, didn't hold down jobs, and the mom eventually threatened to move away. When the house sold, she sent him to the shelter, and now he's a barber living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is an adult, so the mom isn't legally obligated to support him. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, even if the intention was to push him to become independent. But the alternative was letting him stay, which could enable his behavior.\n\nThe mom did give him conditions and tried to guide him towards a trade. The shelter was a last resort after years of inaction. The son eventually found a job after being forced to go to barber school. So, while it was a difficult method, the outcome was positive. \n\nOther parents might have different approaches, like cutting off financial support or setting strict boundaries. But the mom's action was extreme. However, the key is whether she had a right to do it. Since it's her choice, and the son is an adult, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
