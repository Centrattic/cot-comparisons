This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter. The parent's reasoning is that the son wasn't getting a job, was lazy, and after moving away, they felt this extreme measure was necessary.\n\nFirst, the son is 23, which is an adult. The parent might have felt frustrated, but is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter appropriate? Adult children have the right to make their own life choices, even if those choices lead to hardship. While the parent's intention was to push the son to become independent, the method seems harsh. There might be other ways to encourage responsibility without resorting to such an extreme step. Also, homeless shelters are for people in immediate need of shelter, not as a disciplinary measure. The parent's actions could be seen as neglecting their son's needs, especially since he was still an adult and the parent was still providing care. The son later went to barber school and succeeded, but the question is about whether the method was right. The parent might have considered alternatives like allowing the son to live at home with conditions, or seeking professional help. Overall, while the parent wanted to help, the approach was questionable. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
