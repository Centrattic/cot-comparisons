This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother was wrong for taking her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the son was 23, an adult. The mom tried for years to encourage him to get a job or go to trade school. He had some jobs but didn't stick with them. When she sold her house, she moved away and then sent him to a shelter. He ended up going to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nSo, the key points here: the son is an adult, the mom felt she had tried everything else, and she took a drastic step. Now, the question is whether she was in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider ethical, legal, and social aspects. Legally, a 23-year-old is an adult, so the mother doesn't have legal authority to force him to leave, but she can choose not to support him financially. However, taking him to a homeless shelter might be seen as a harsh measure. Was that necessary? Were there other options?\n\nEthically, the mother's intention was to push her son to become self-sufficient. That's understandable. But using a homeless shelter as a tactic might be seen as cruel, even if the outcome was positive. Other parents might handle it differently, like setting boundaries with financial consequences or encouraging independence without cutting off entirely. \n\nAlso, the son didn't resist, which might indicate he knew he needed to change. But sending an adult child to a shelter could be traumatic and might not be the best approach for someone who isn't homeless by choice. There's a question of whether there were other support systems or resources that could have been used first, like counseling or job placement services.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's actions did lead to a positive outcome. The son found a career in barber school. But the method was extreme. Some might argue that while the intent was good, the method was too harsh and could have been avoided with different strategies.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's rare for parents to send adult children to shelters. Most would use other means like moving out, charging rent, or cutting off financial support. The mother's approach might be seen as extreme, even if it worked. \n\nSo, considering all this, the mother's actions were harsh but perhaps not entirely wrong given the context. However, the method might not be the best approach. The answer hinges on whether the extreme action was justified. Since the son is an adult, the mother isn't legally at fault, but ethically, it's debatable. The answer is likely B (No), but there's nuance here.\n"
