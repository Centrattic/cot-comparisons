This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the son is 23, which is an adult. The parent mentions that the son was irresponsible, not holding jobs, and not contributing. The parent tried to push him towards trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. The parent eventually decided to sell the house and move, giving the son an ultimatum. When the son didn't change his ways, the parent sent him to a shelter.\n\nThe parent's intention was to force the son into independence. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own. The parent is questioning if this was the right approach.\n\nNow, considering ethical and legal aspects. Sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. The parent could have considered other options like setting strict boundaries, cutting financial support, or encouraging the son to seek help through other means. However, the parent's goal was to push the son towards self-reliance, which is understandable. The son's current success suggests the method worked, but the method itself is questionable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have a duty to care for their children until they are adults. Once adult, the child is responsible for themselves. However, the parent might still feel a moral obligation. Legally, the parent isn't necessarily wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. The parent could have explored other avenues before resorting to the shelter. Also, homeless shelters are for people in immediate need, not as a disciplinary measure.\n\nOther parents might use different strategies, like setting clear expectations and consequences without using homelessness as a punishment. The parent's action might be seen as extreme, but given the son's inaction, it's a tough call. The key points are the son's age, the parent's attempts to help, and the effectiveness of the method. The parent might not be in the wrong, but there could be better ways to handle it.\n"
