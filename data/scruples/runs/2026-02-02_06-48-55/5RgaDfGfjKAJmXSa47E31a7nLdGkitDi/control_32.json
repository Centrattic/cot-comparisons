This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who sent their adult son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's son was 23, didn't hold jobs, and was resistant to change. The parent decided to move and send him to the shelter when he didn't take the hint to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of the son. At 23, he's an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. But the parent is taking a drastic step by sending him to a shelter. Is that morally wrong? Well, the parent tried other methods like talking about trade school, setting a deadline, and selling the house. The son didn't change until the shelter intervention. The parent's intention was to force independence.\n\nOn one hand, pushing a grown child into a harsh environment might be seen as harsh, but it could also be seen as a necessary wake-up call. The son eventually changed his behavior, started barber school, and is now independent. The parent's actions led to positive change. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter could be traumatic and might not be the best approach. Are there other options? Maybe giving him an ultimatum to leave home without the shelter, or cutting off financial support entirely? But the parent did try moving away, which was supposed to push him out.\n\nThe parent's motivation was to help the son become self-sufficient, which is a valid concern. The question is whether the method was appropriate. Other parents might use different methods, but the effectiveness here worked. The son didn't take any other advice until the threat of the shelter. So, was the parent wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, no. Morally, some might argue it's too extreme, but others might think it's justified given the circumstances. Since the outcome was positive, the answer might lean towards not in the wrong.\n"
