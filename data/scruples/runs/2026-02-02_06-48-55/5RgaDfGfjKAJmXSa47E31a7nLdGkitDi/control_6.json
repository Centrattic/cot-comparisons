This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. I need to consider the situation from both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the parent's side: their son was 23, didn't hold a job for long, and was unresponsive to discussions. The parent felt guilty but decided to move away and send him to the shelter to force independence. The son eventually went to barber school and is now self-sufficient. The parent is asking if there was a better way and if they're at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, sending a dependent adult child to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. It could be seen as neglectful or even abusive, especially if the parent had the means to support them. Homes are supposed to be safe spaces, and using a shelter as a threat might have long-term emotional effects. There might be alternative solutions like setting strict boundaries, providing financial support with conditions, or seeking counseling.\n\nThe parent's intention was to push the son towards independence, which they achieved eventually. But the method raises ethical questions. Is it ever right to send a family member to a homeless shelter? It's extreme and might not be considered a responsible parenting approach, even for an adult child. Other parents might handle it by setting clear expectations, perhaps cutting off financial support, but not using a shelter as a punishment.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they never heard of other parents doing this. That could indicate that this approach is unusual and possibly excessive. The key here is whether the action was necessary and proportionate. The son did end up getting help, but the method might be seen as cruel or overstepping parental responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's goal was to encourage independence, the method used was extreme and potentially harmful. There might be better ways to enforce accountability without resorting to such drastic measures. Therefore, the parent could be considered in the wrong for the approach taken, even if the outcome was positive.\n"
