This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mother who, frustrated with her 23-year-old son's lack of responsibility, sent him to a homeless shelter. The son wasn't working, didn't take her advice about trade schools seriously, and after selling the house, she made him go to the shelter. Eventually, he went to barber school and is now self-sufficient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The mother's intention was to force her son to become independent, which is a common concern for parents. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is drastic. Even though the son was 23, he was still her child, and using a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh or even abusive. The shelter is for people who genuinely need help, not a punishment. The mother could have found other ways to push him towards independence, like cutting financial support, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging him to move out on his own terms. \n\nOn the other hand, the son wasn't trying to better himself, which is frustrating for any parent. The mother's actions did lead to him eventually getting a trade and becoming self-sufficient. But the method used is questionable. There's a line between tough love and actual harm. The shelter might have been a traumatic experience, and even if it worked, it's not necessarily the right approach. \n\nPublic opinion on AITA threads often leans towards supporting parents who enforce tough love, but there's also criticism when actions are seen as going too far. The key points here are whether the mother had other options and if the shelter was an appropriate place for this. Since the shelter has limited beds for specific needs, using it as a last resort punishment might not be justifiable. Also, the emotional impact on the son and the mother's role in his upbringing could be factors. \n\nIn the end, while the mother's intentions were to help her son grow, the method of using a homeless shelter could be seen as an overreaction. There might be better, more compassionate ways to encourage independence without subjecting the child to such a harsh environment. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but there are arguments on both sides.\n"
