This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, being unproductive, and the parent decided to cut off support by moving away and forcing him into the shelter. The son later went to barber school and is now doing better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent did try to encourage the son to get a job and go to trade school before, but the son wasn't responsive. The parent's decision was drastic but might be seen as a last resort. The parent also provided a condition for the son to come back, which he accepted. \n\nHowever, sending an adult child to a shelter could be seen as harsh. The parent's intention was to force independence, but others might argue that there could be other ways to push the son towards responsibility without such an extreme measure. Also, the parent did eventually help by setting a condition for the son's return, which might mitigate some of the harshness.\n\nOn the other hand, the son was an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The parent's actions might be seen as tough love, aiming to prevent the son from becoming dependent. The outcome was positive since the son changed his ways. But some might question if the method was too extreme and if there were alternative steps that could have been taken first, like legal disownment, cutting off all financial support without the shelter incident, or involving other family members or social services.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's actions were motivated by a desire to help the son become independent, but the method was extreme. However, since the son is now better off, the outcome could justify the means. Still, others might argue that using a homeless shelter was unnecessarily harsh and could have done more harm than good. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parent's actions were justified as a form of tough love or if they overstepped. The parent did give the son an ultimatum, which the son eventually heeded. The parent also provided a path for reconciliation. So, while the method was extreme, the intention was to help, and the outcome was positive. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if there were less drastic ways to push the son towards responsibility, the parent could be seen as in the wrong for choosing a more harmful approach. But since the son was an adult, the parent's responsibility to support him isn't absolute. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No), the parent is not in the wrong because the son was an adult, and the parent acted to encourage independence, albeit through a harsh method. However, there's a counterargument that the method was too extreme. But considering the context and the positive outcome, B seems more appropriate.\n"
