This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs and being uncooperative. The parent felt guilty but thought it was necessary to push him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They tried various methods to get their son to work\u2014trade school suggestions, setting boundaries, and eventually moving away. When that didn't work, they took drastic action. The parent's intention was to force independence, which is a common concern with adult children who aren't self-sufficient.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter is an extreme measure. It's a public service for people in dire situations, not typically used for disciplinary purposes. The parent might be overstepping by using a shelter as a consequence rather than other options like legal eviction or allowing the son to face natural consequences of his actions without state intervention.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the son eventually became a barber and is now living on his own. That suggests the action worked, but does that justify the method? There's a debate about the ethics of using homelessness as a life lesson. Some might argue it's harsh, while others see it as necessary for change.\n\nAnother angle: Is the parent legally allowed to do this? If the son was an adult, the parent might not have the legal right to force him out in such a way. Eviction typically requires legal processes, so using a shelter could be a way to bypass that, which might not be appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the parent's guilt indicates they're aware of the severity. The fact that they called every day to the shelter to get a spot shows they were determined, but maybe there were other steps they could have taken first, like cutting financial support gradually or involving social services.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people might not resort to shelters. Other methods like setting clear consequences, cutting off financial support, or requiring the child to move out with a support plan could be considered more appropriate. Using a homeless shelter, which serves those in immediate need, might be exploiting the system for a disciplinary action.\n\nSo, the parent's intention was to help their son become independent, but the method was extreme. There's a line between tough love and harmful actions. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the action was extreme and possibly misuse of a public resource, even if the outcome was positive. However, others might argue that it was a necessary step given the circumstances. But given the potential ethical and legal issues, the answer could be A.\n"
