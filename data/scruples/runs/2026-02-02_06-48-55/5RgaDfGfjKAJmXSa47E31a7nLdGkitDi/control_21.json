This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the mother is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that her son is 23, not working, just hanging around, playing games, and not taking life seriously. She tried to push him toward trade school but he didn't take it. He had some short-term jobs but quit or got fired. Then she decided to sell her house and move, and when he didn't come with her, she sent him to a homeless shelter. Eventually, he went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, once a child turns 18 or 21, they are legally adults. So, the mother isn't necessarily required to support them. However, sending your adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. But she did do it as a way to force him to become independent. She also later offered him a condition to come back if he went to barber school, which he accepted and succeeded.\n\nOn one hand, she took a drastic step to push him towards independence, which he hadn't responded to any other methods. On the other hand, sending someone to a shelter, even if they're an adult, could be seen as cruel or using fear as a tactic. But she did it because she wanted to stop enabling his behavior. He was already in the process of moving out anyway with the house sale. \n\nI should also think about the alternatives she might have considered. Maybe there were other ways to encourage him, like cutting off financial support, making him live elsewhere, or enlisting professional help. However, she might have felt that the shelter was the only way to make him realize the consequences. \n\nThe key points here are her intent to help him become independent, the fact that he did eventually take the offered condition and succeed, and the context that he was an adult. While the method was extreme, the outcome was positive. So, the question is whether her actions were justifiable given her goal and the alternatives. Since other parents might use different methods, but her action led to a positive change, it's possible she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that the shelter was too harsh. But given that he was an adult and she didn't harm him, maybe it's not wrong. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
