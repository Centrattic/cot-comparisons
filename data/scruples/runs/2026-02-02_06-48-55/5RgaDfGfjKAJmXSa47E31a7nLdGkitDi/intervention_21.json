This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who took their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's son wasn't working, was irresponsible, and after a long period of inaction, the parent decided to send him to a shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now doing well. The parent is asking if there was a better way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their son to become independent. But using a homeless shelter as a method seems harsh. Are there other options? Maybe giving him an ultimatum to leave but without the immediate threat of homelessness? Or maybe setting up a structured support system where the son has to meet certain conditions to stay?\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might have felt that the son was not responding to any other methods. The son had been given multiple chances to get a job or go to school but didn't take them. The parent might have felt that this was a last resort. Also, the shelter had limited beds, so maybe the parent had to act quickly once there was an opening.\n\nBut sending someone to a homeless shelter could be traumatic. Even if the son agreed, it's a drastic measure. Other parents might use different strategies like cutting off financial support, requiring the adult child to move out, or encouraging them to find their own place with some guidance. The parent could have offered to help with job searches or vocational training without the threat of homelessness.\n\nThe parent did allow the son to come back under the condition of attending barber school, which worked. But was the method appropriate? The shelter might have been a shock tactic, but it's possible there were less severe alternatives. The parent's guilt suggests they might also feel it was too harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parent's goal was to push the son to responsibility, but the method might have been excessive. However, given the son's history, the parent might not have had other options in their view. It's hard to judge without knowing all the circumstances, but from the given information, the parent's actions might be seen as overly punitive. So the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
