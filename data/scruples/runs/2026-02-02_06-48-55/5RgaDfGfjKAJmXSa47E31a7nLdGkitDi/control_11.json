This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. \n\nFirst, the son is 23, which is an adult. The parent tried to encourage him to get a job, go to trade school, but he kept failing to stay employed. The parent sold the house and moved away, then sent him to the shelter when the house was sold. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own. \n\nThe parent feels guilty but is asking if they did the right thing. The question is whether the parent is at fault. \n\nOn one hand, the parent tried to help their son become independent but faced resistance. The son wasn't contributing, and the parent felt they had to take drastic measures. On the other hand, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. But since the son is an adult, does the parent have the right to do that? \n\nOther factors: The parent gave the son a chance to change by suggesting trade school, and the son eventually did go to barber school. The parent might have felt that the shelter was the only way to make him realize he needed to take responsibility. \n\nBut is there a better way? Maybe other parents talk to their kids, set boundaries, or involve other support systems. However, the parent did set a condition after he left the shelter, which worked. \n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as a last resort to push the son into independence. Since the son is an adult, the parent might not be in the wrong for enforcing responsibility. So, the answer might be B (No). But some might argue that the shelter approach was too extreme. But given the context, maybe it's justified.\n"
