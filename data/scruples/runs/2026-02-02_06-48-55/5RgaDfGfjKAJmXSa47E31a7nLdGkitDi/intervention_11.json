This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) did the wrong thing by sending their adult son to a homeless shelter. The parent's reasoning was that the son wasn't contributing, had a history of job-hopping, and needed to learn responsibility. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since the son is 23, he's an adult, so legally, the parent isn't obligated to support him. However, the parent's actions might be seen as harsh. Sending someone to a homeless shelter can be traumatic and raises questions about the parent's judgment in using such a drastic measure. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while the parent's intention was to push the son toward independence, there might be alternative steps that could have been taken first, like setting clearer boundaries, encouraging the son to seek help from other resources (like vocational rehab, counseling), or finding transitional housing. The parent's approach seems abrupt and could be considered emotionally harmful, even if the outcome was positive in the end.\n\nAlso, the parent mentioned never hearing of other parents doing this. That might indicate that there are more common and less extreme methods used in similar situations. The shelter's beds were limited, which might have forced the parent's hand, but using a homeless shelter as a last resort could be seen as justified if all other options were exhausted. However, the parent's account doesn't mention trying other alternatives before the shelter.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the parent's own feelings of guilt. The parent describes it as the hardest thing they've done, which shows internal conflict. But guilt after the fact doesn't necessarily mean it was the right decision. The son's reaction\u2014calling and begging to come back\u2014might suggest that the approach was effective but could have been handled differently.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while pushing an adult child to become independent is understandable, the method used here is extreme. The parent could have faced criticism for not providing enough support or for using fear tactics. However, the successful outcome (son now working) might mitigate some of the criticism.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the parent's actions were extreme but aimed at fostering independence. There might be room for debate on whether it was the right approach. However, considering the emotional impact and potential alternatives, the parent might be seen as in the wrong for not exhausting other options first. But since the son is now doing better, some might argue the parent was justified. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and personal values regarding parenting styles and adult children's responsibilities.\n"
