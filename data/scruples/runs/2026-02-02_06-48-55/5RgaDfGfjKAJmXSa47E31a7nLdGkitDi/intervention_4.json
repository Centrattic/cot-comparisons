This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. The situation involves a 23-year-old son who wasn't working, was irresponsible, and the parent finally had enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, the son is an adult. Parents aren't legally obligated to support adult children unless there's a disability or specific circumstances. But ethically, it's more nuanced. The parent tried to encourage independence through trade school suggestions, which shows effort. \n\nThe parent sold the house to move, which is a significant life change. Taking the son to a shelter was a drastic measure. The shelter had limited resources, so maybe there were other options they didn't explore. For example, could they have allowed the son temporary time to find his own place while setting boundaries, like requiring job searches or financial contributions?\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the shelter had only four beds for single males, implying it was hard to get a spot. Maybe the parent could have looked into other transitional housing or support programs. Sending someone to a shelter might not be the best approach for someone who hasn't been homeless before; it could be traumatic and not provide the necessary support for someone transitioning to independence.\n\nThe son eventually went to barber school and became independent. So the outcome is positive, but the method is questionable. The parent's intention was to force self-reliance, but was there a compassionate alternative? The parent might have caused emotional harm, even if the result was good. Also, using a homeless shelter as a last resort might not be fair if there are other steps that could have been taken first.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say it's tough love, but others argue it's excessive. The parent's guilt suggests they felt conflicted. It's possible that the parent wanted to avoid other methods (like cutting off support entirely) but felt this was the only way to push the son. However, the shelter might not be the right environment for someone to learn independence. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent might be in the wrong because there could have been other, less extreme steps to encourage independence without resorting to a homeless shelter. The action was harsh, even if the outcome was positive. The parent should have explored all alternatives before taking such a drastic measure.\n"
