This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent took their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had been lazy, not holding jobs, and the parent tried to push him into a trade school. After selling the house and moving, the parent finally sent him to the shelter. Now the son is doing well after going to barber school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. A 23-year-old is an adult, so legally, the parent isn't obligated to support him. The parent's actions might be seen as a last resort after years of the son not taking responsibility. But sending an adult child to a homeless shelter could be harsh. Are there other ways to encourage independence? The parent mentions that others might handle it differently, but in this case, they felt this was necessary to make the son change.\n\nHowever, there's the question of whether the parent should have explored other options first, like setting clear boundaries, cutting off financial support, or encouraging vocational training without resorting to homelessness. The parent did mention they pushed for a trade school, and the son eventually went to barber school after being sent away. \n\nThe parent's motivation seems to be to force the son to become self-sufficient, which is a valid concern. But the method of using a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. However, the outcome was positive\u2014the son now works and is independent. \n\nIs the parent wrong? It's a tough call. While the method was drastic, the parent's intention was to help the son, and it worked. But maybe there were less extreme measures. The community might have mixed reactions. Some might say it's justified as a wake-up call, others might think it's too harsh. The parent's guilt suggests they were conflicted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a black-and-white issue. However, since the son is now doing well, maybe the parent's actions were effective. But ethically, sending someone to a shelter when there are alternatives (even if the parent didn't use them) could be questioned. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal parenting styles. But given the outcome and the parent's reasoning, some might side with the parent. However, others might argue there were better ways. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Given that the parent acted out of concern and the result was positive, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
