This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong by taking their son to a homeless shelter. Let me break down the story first.\n\nThe mom is a single parent, I assume, since she's raising her son alone. Her son is 23, didn't go to college, tried bartending for six months, then other short-term jobs. He wasn't contributing, always partied, and didn't take her advice seriously. The mom had enough, sold the house, moved away, and when he still didn't take responsibility, she sent him to a homeless shelter. Eventually, he went to barber school and is now independent.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the mom was trying to push her adult son to become independent. He's 23, so technically an adult. She gave him chances, he didn't take them. She used the shelter as a last resort. Maybe she felt it was necessary to show him the consequences of not working. She could have kicked him out without the shelter, but maybe she thought the shelter would motivate him more. It did work, as he ended up getting a job as a barber.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter is drastic. Even though he's an adult, the shelter is for people without homes. By doing this, she's denying him a place to stay, which could be seen as abandoning him. However, he was already not contributing and wasn't respecting her efforts to get him to take responsibility. The shelter might have been a way to force his hand. Also, she gave him a chance to come back under the condition of going to barber school, which he accepted. So in the end, he did get help.\n\nBut there's an argument that she could have handled it differently. For example, maybe offering him a place to stay with strict conditions, like a set amount of time or requiring him to find a job before moving out. However, she tried that before with the house sale and moving. He didn't take it seriously. The shelter was a final step after all other options failed.\n\nAlso, considering the son's age and the fact that he's an adult, it's his responsibility to take care of himself. The mom might be right in pushing him to take that step. However, the method of sending him to a shelter might be harsh, but maybe necessary given his lack of responsiveness to other methods.\n\nI should also think about the impact on the son. Was the shelter the right way to show him consequences? It could be traumatic but effective. Alternatively, there might be support systems, job programs, or counseling that she could have used. But the story says she tried all that\u2014trade school suggestions, job attempts, etc.\u2014and he didn't follow through.\n\nIn the end, he became independent, so maybe the method worked. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a societal perspective, some might see it as harsh, but others might see it as a necessary action to promote self-reliance. It's a tough call. The key points are the son's age and his lack of responsibility, the mother's attempts to help, and the effectiveness of the method used.\n\nI think the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's enforcing independence on an adult child who wasn't taking responsibility. However, there's a debate about the method. But considering the alternatives and the outcome, it might be justified.\n"
