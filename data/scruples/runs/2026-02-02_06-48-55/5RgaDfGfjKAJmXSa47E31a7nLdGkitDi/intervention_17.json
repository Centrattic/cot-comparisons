This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent feels guilty but thinks it was necessary to push him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They wanted their son to take responsibility and learn a trade. They did try other approaches like suggesting trade schools and giving him opportunities to work. When those didn't work, they escalated to moving away and finally sending him to the shelter. The son eventually got a job in a trade after being at the shelter.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is the parent's action justified? The parent is an adult, so the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, so the parent isn't obligated to support him. But sending him to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. However, the parent did give him a chance to attend barber school as a condition to come back, which helped him get on his feet. \n\nI should consider if there were other options. Maybe the parent could have cut off financial support gradually or found other ways to encourage independence without using a homeless shelter. But the parent felt that was the only way to make him take action. The son did change after the experience, so maybe the parent's approach worked. \n\nBut is it ethical to send someone to a homeless shelter as a form of punishment? Homeless shelters are meant for people in crisis, not as a disciplinary measure. The parent might be using the shelter's resources in a way that's not intended. Also, the son didn't resist, which might indicate he saw it coming, but it's still a harsh method. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's goal was to help the son become self-sufficient, which is a valid concern. The outcome was positive, so the action had a purpose. However, the method might be questionable. There's a line between tough love and being inconsiderate. The parent might not be in the wrong if their intent was genuinely to help, but others might argue that the means were too harsh. \n\nI need to balance the intent with the method. The answer depends on whether the action is seen as justified for the outcome. If the parent's actions led to the son becoming independent, maybe it's not the parent's fault. But if the method was cruel or unnecessary, then the parent could be at fault. \n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong here, but the parent's action was extreme. However, the outcome was positive. The shelter might not be the best way, but the parent's intent was to help. So, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong, but others might disagree. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the parent's action, though harsh, led to the son's improvement and was intended for his benefit.\n"
