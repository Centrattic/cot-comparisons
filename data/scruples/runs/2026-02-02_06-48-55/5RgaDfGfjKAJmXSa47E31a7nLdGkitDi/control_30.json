This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent tried various methods to get the son to become self-sufficient, including encouraging trade school and setting boundaries. The son wasn't working consistently, and when the parent moved away, the son didn't adjust. Eventually, the parent sent him to the shelter as a last resort, which led to the son getting a job in barber school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted to push their son towards independence. The son was an adult, so the parent might feel justified in setting firm boundaries. However, using a homeless shelter as a tactic is extreme. Are there other ways they could have handled it? Maybe offering temporary support while pushing for accountability, or finding other resources like job training programs instead of cutting off support entirely. \n\nBut the parent did try other methods over the years. The son wasn't responding to those. The parent's action, while harsh, might be seen as a way to force the son to confront reality. Also, the parent gave the son a chance to come back under conditions, which shows they weren't entirely cutting ties. The son eventually succeeded, which might indicate the method worked. \n\nOn the other hand, sending an adult child to a shelter could be seen as cruel, even if the intention was good. It's a drastic measure and might not be the most compassionate approach. Other parents might use different strategies, like setting clear expectations with consequences that are less extreme. But since the son wasn't taking any steps towards responsibility, the parent might have felt desperate. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The parent's actions led to positive change, but the method was harsh. Legally, they might not be in the wrong since the son is an adult. Ethically, it's debatable. The answer likely isn't a clear A or B. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" Since the parent's goal was to promote independence and they tried other methods, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the method was too harsh, making it A. However, given the context and the positive outcome, B seems more plausible.\n"
