This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. The parent explains that the son was unemployed, didn't take their advice to get a trade, and after selling the house, the parent had to take this step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, sending him to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, but maybe they had no other choice given the son's behavior. The parent tried other methods like suggesting trade schools and setting a deadline. The son didn't comply, so maybe this was a last resort.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The parent wants to push the son to become independent. But using a homeless shelter as a method might be extreme. Are there other options? Like cutting off financial support entirely, or encouraging the son to find his own place gradually? The parent mentions that the son eventually went to barber school and now lives on his own, which is a positive outcome. \n\nThe question is whether sending him to a shelter was the only way. Maybe the parent could have tried other methods first, like requiring the son to move out on his own terms, without the shock of a shelter. However, the parent might have felt that this drastic action was necessary to wake the son up. \n\nAlso, the parent's intention was to help the son become self-sufficient. The son did comply after being sent away, so the outcome worked. But some might argue that using a shelter could be traumatic and maybe unnecessary. However, given the son's history of not taking initiative, the parent might have had valid reasons.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's rare for parents to use shelters, but that doesn't mean it's wrong. The key factors are intent, the son's age, and the eventual positive result. The parent isn't in the wrong because they prioritized their son's independence, even if the method was tough love.\n"
