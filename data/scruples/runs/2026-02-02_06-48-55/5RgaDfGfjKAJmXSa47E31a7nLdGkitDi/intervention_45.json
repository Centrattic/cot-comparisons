This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mother has a 23-year-old son who's been unemployed, not holding down jobs, and living off her. She tried to push him toward a trade school but he didn't stick with anything. When she moved away, she sent him to a shelter. Now he's working as a barber.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to consider different angles. \n\nOn one side, the mother is trying to force her adult son to become independent. At 23, he's an adult, and she's probably right that he needs to take responsibility. But sending him to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. Is there a line between being strict and being harmful? \n\nMaybe there are other ways to encourage independence without resorting to a shelter. For example, cutting off financial support entirely, setting clear consequences, or helping him find job training. Also, the son might have needed more support or guidance rather than being thrown out. \n\nBut the mother's perspective is that she tried everything else and was at her breaking point. She might believe that the harsh action was necessary for him to learn. However, using a homeless shelter could be seen as cruel or unnecessary, especially if there were other options available. \n\nAnother angle: Is the shelter the right place for this? Homeless shelters are for people in immediate need, not as a disciplinary measure. Maybe the mother should have looked into other resources first, like transitional housing or community programs. \n\nAlso, the son's reaction\u2014calling and begging to come back\u2014shows that the experience made him realize he needed to change. That worked out, but what if it didn't? The mother might have made the situation worse. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to use someone's homelessness as a punishment? Even though he's an adult, there's a moral obligation to ensure they have a safe place to stay. Sending him to a shelter could be seen as abdicating that responsibility. \n\nBut then again, the mother is setting boundaries for her own well-being. She's trying to protect herself from being taken advantage of and helping her son take responsibility. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. While her intentions might be good, the method is questionable. There might not be a legal wrong, but morally, it's debatable. The answer could be \"A\" (Yes) because the action was extreme, or \"B\" (No) because she's trying to help her son grow up. \n\nI think the key is whether there were less harmful ways to achieve the same result. If she had other options and didn't explore them, then she's in the wrong. But if she genuinely tried everything else, maybe not. However, the story says she called every day until a shelter bed opened, which suggests she didn't look into other alternatives first. So maybe \"A\" is the right choice here.\n"
