This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son was 23, an adult. The parent mentions he couldn't hold a job, was uninterested in working, and just played video games. The parent tried encouraging him to get into a trade school, like the parent did, but he didn't stick with it. The parent eventually decided to sell the house and move, and then when the house sold, sent him to a homeless shelter because he wasn't coming with them.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the son is an adult. Even though he's still in the process of finding his path, the parent might feel responsible, but at 23, the son is legally an adult. Some might argue that the parent overstepped by using the homeless shelter as a last resort. However, the parent did give him a chance to go to barber school and now he's working. Maybe the parent was trying to enforce independence.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh, especially if there were other options available. Did the parent consider alternatives like finding a place for him to stay with friends, getting him job training, or other support services? The parent mentions they tried talking to him about jobs and trade schools, but the son wasn't cooperative. However, the shelter situation might have been a shock tactic to push him to change.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they never heard of other parents doing this. That could imply that it's an extreme measure. But maybe in some cases, it's necessary. However, using a homeless shelter might have emotional and psychological effects on the son. Did the parent have the right to do that? Or should they have sought other forms of intervention?\n\nAnother angle: the parent is a single parent? The scenario doesn't specify, but maybe they feel they can't support the son anymore. But if the son is an adult, the parent isn't obligated to support him. However, the method of sending him to a shelter might be seen as inhumane or too drastic without exhausting all other options first.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for adult children to live at home while they figure things out, but there's a point where parents need to set boundaries. The parent did give him a condition to come back (barber school), which he accepted. So maybe the parent's intention was to motivate him to take responsibility.\n\nBut was sending him to a shelter the right way? Maybe not. There could be alternative steps, like cutting off financial support, making him find his own place, or enrolling him in a program. The shelter might have been a last resort, but perhaps the parent didn't consider other options, leading to the action being seen as too harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intent was to push the son to become independent, the method of using a homeless shelter might be seen as excessive. There could be a better way without resorting to such a drastic measure. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not considering other options first. However, others might argue that it was a necessary step for the son's growth. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards A (the parent is in the wrong) because using a homeless shelter could be considered an extreme and potentially harmful action without exhausting other avenues.\n"
