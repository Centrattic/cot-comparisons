This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. The situation involves a 23-year-old adult child who wasn't working, wasn't taking responsibility, and the parent felt forced to take drastic measures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so legally, the parent isn't obligated to support him. However, sending him to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, especially if there were alternatives. The parent did give warnings and tried to encourage the son to get a trade, but he didn't follow through. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The parent's intention was to push the son to become independent, which is a common parenting goal. But using a homeless shelter as a method might be extreme. The parent mentions that the shelter had limited beds and was full, so maybe they had to act when an opening came. The son eventually took barber school and is living on his own now, which shows the action had a positive outcome. \n\nBut is there a better way? The parent could have set other conditions, like requiring the son to live elsewhere with a time limit, or providing some financial support while he got on his feet. Sending him to a shelter might be seen as abandoning him without support. However, the parent might argue that they were trying to enforce responsibility.\n\nAlso, the parent's motivation is important here. They wanted the son to learn independence, which is understandable. However, using a homeless shelter could be traumatic, and there might be concerns about the parent's role in their adult child's life. \n\nConsidering societal norms, most parents don't send their adult children to shelters. It's a rare and extreme action. The parent might be in the wrong because it's an unusual and potentially harmful solution, even if the intention was good. But if the son was a grown adult and the parent was done supporting him, maybe it's not in the wrong. \n\nI need to balance the intention, the action's severity, and the outcome. The son did eventually get better, but the method used was extreme. The parent could have faced legal issues if the son wanted to press charges, but since he's an adult, the parent's responsibility isn't legally required. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's goal was to promote independence, the method used was harsh and possibly unnecessary. There might have been kinder ways to push the son towards self-sufficiency. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for using such an extreme measure without exploring other options first.\n"
