This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe parent's son wasn't working consistently, was spending time gaming and with friends, and ignored advice about trade schools. The parent tried to get him to take responsibility but eventually decided to sell the house and move, then sent him to the shelter when he didn't change his ways. Eventually, the son went to barber school and is now working.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, so the parent isn't obligated to support him. However, sending him to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. It's important to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. While the parent might not be legally wrong, the approach could be seen as harsh. \n\nOther options might include cutting off financial support, encouraging independence without using extreme measures, or seeking counseling. But the parent felt it was the only way to push them to change. The son did eventually change, which suggests the method worked, but that doesn't necessarily justify it. \n\nThere's a debate about the role of parents in their adult children's lives. Some might argue that the shelter was a harsh lesson, but others might see it as necessary to teach responsibility. The parent's intent was to force their son to become self-sufficient, which is a valid goal. However, the method might have been too extreme, especially if there were other avenues not explored. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions never hearing of others resorting to this, which might indicate that there are different approaches. It's possible that the parent could have tried more gradual steps before such a drastic action. \n\nIn terms of guilt, the parent feels bad about it, which adds emotional weight. The outcome is positive, but the process is questionable. The answer hinges on whether extreme measures are justified for an adult child's independence. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong legally or morally, but there might be better ways to handle it. However, since the son became independent, some might argue it worked. The community's \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) context often favors solutions that balance firmness with compassion. The parent might not be in the wrong, but the approach is debatable. So, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
