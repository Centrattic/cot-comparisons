This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, not contributing, and the author felt it was necessary to push him to become independent. The son eventually went to barber school and is now working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, the method of sending him to a homeless shelter is extreme. The parent's intention was to force independence, which could be seen as tough love. But sending someone to a shelter can be traumatic and may not be the most constructive way. \n\nThe parent mentions they tried talking to the son about jobs and education before, but he didn't take it seriously. The parent's actions were a last resort after a long period of the son not contributing. The alternative options might include cutting off financial support, setting firm boundaries, or encouraging him to find a job without using the shelter. \n\nSome might argue that the parent's actions were necessary to push the son towards responsibility, and the son did eventually change. Others might say it was too harsh and there were better ways to handle it without using a homeless shelter as a threat. The parent's guilt and the positive outcome (son became a barber) could also be considered. \n\nHowever, the method of using a homeless shelter might be seen as inhumane, especially if there were other less severe options. The parent could have faced legal issues if the son was still a dependent, but at 23, that's less likely. The key points are intent, the son's age, and whether the action was necessary. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and proportionality. If the parent's goal was to help the son become independent and the method, while harsh, led to a positive outcome, some might side with the parent. But the harshness of the method could be seen as crossing a line, making the parent the asshole. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action was proportionate and if there were less harmful alternatives. The parent might not be in the wrong if the intent was good and the son is now better, but the method could be questioned. However, AITA often considers the emotional impact and the extremity of the action. The parent's guilt also suggests they see the action as harsh. \n\nI think the answer is A (the parent is in the wrong) because sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is an extreme measure that could have been avoided with other strategies, even if the intent was to help. The trauma of that experience might not be worth the end result, and there are more constructive ways to enforce independence without such a harsh approach.\n"
