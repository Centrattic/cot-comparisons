This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent in the scenario is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son is 23, not a child anymore, but still living at home. He's not working consistently, playing video games, and not contributing. The parent tried to push him into a trade school, but he didn't commit. He had jobs that didn't last. When the parent decided to move, the son continued to do nothing. Finally, the parent sent him to a homeless shelter as a way to force independence.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. In most places, once someone is 18, they're an adult, but parents aren't legally obligated to support them. However, the parent here provided housing and support, which is common but not required. The action of sending him to a homeless shelter is extreme. But the parent is also trying to enforce responsibility.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, they took a drastic step, but the son was an adult who wasn't self-sufficient. The parent tried other methods first, like encouraging trade school and giving warnings. The shelter was a last resort. However, using a homeless shelter as a punishment might not be the best approach. There could be better ways, like cutting off financial support or setting conditions for living at home. Also, the parent did later allow the son to come back once he committed to barber school, showing they care.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a shelter could be seen as harsh, but the parent's intention was to push the son to change. The outcome was positive; the son became a barber and lives on his own. The parent might have felt it was necessary for his growth. But the method is questionable. Alternatives could include legal measures if the son was causing harm, but since it's about independence, it's more about parenting style.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's approach was tough, their motivation was to encourage the son's independence. However, using a homeless shelter might be seen as too extreme without exploring other options first. But since the son was an adult, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), but there's nuance.\n"
