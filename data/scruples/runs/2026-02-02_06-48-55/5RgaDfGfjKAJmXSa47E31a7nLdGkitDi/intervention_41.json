This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. The situation is that the son wasn't getting a job, was unproductive, and the mom eventually had to move away and sent him to the shelter. The son later started a trade school and now works as a barber.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the son is an adult, so the mom isn't obligated to take care of him. But sending him to a homeless shelter might have been a last resort after trying other methods. The mom tried to push him towards trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. She gave him time to make plans before moving, but he didn't act. Then she moved away and sent him to the shelter. \n\nEthically, it's a tough call. On one hand, she's trying to force independence, which is important for an adult child. On the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh. However, she didn't abandon him entirely; she provided an escape route through barber school. Also, the son eventually succeeded, so maybe the method worked, but was it necessary?\n\nOther parents might handle it by setting boundaries without involving shelters. Maybe there were alternative steps, like cutting off financial support, requiring him to find a job before moving, or involving other family members. But the mom felt she had tried to guide him. The key point is whether the shelter was the only option left after all else failed. Since the son didn't respond to other measures, and the mom was moving, the shelter might have been the only way to enforce independence. However, using a homeless shelter might have been traumatic and perhaps unnecessary if there were other transitional options like a halfway house or community support programs. \n\nThe mom did check for beds and waited until one was available, showing she tried to do it humanely. Also, the son didn't fight it and eventually succeeded. So while the method was extreme, the intent was to help him become self-sufficient. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she tried to help and the son turned his life around. But some might argue that using a shelter is too harsh. It's a balance between accountability and compassion. Since the outcome was positive, maybe the answer leans towards her not being wrong.\n"
