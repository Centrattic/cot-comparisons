This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who took their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old son who wasn't holding down jobs, was irresponsible, and the parent decided to send him to a shelter to make him independent. The son eventually got a trade and is living on his own now.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the parent's actions. The parent tried to encourage the son to get a job and go to trade school but the son wasn't responsive. The parent sold their house and moved away, then sent the son to a shelter. The parent's intention was to force independence. \n\nNow, considering the rights and responsibilities. Adult children are adults, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support them indefinitely. However, using a homeless shelter as a method might be seen as harsh. The parent might have other options, like cutting financial support, setting boundaries, or encouraging the son to find his own place. But given the son's behavior, the parent might have felt this was necessary to push him towards responsibility.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe. Sending someone to a homeless shelter could be traumatic and might not be the most constructive approach. Some might argue that there are less extreme measures, like requiring the son to pay rent or helping him find a job while he's on his own. However, given the parent's patience and the son's lack of progress, the parent might have felt this was the last resort.\n\nAlso, the son eventually improved after the intervention, which could indicate that the parent's actions had a positive outcome. But the method used is questionable. Homelessness is a serious issue, and using it as a tactic might be seen as harsh, even if the intention was good. The parent didn't mention considering alternatives like transitional housing or support networks. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a gray area. The parent's goal was to help the son become self-sufficient, which is commendable. However, the method might be seen as extreme. Some people might argue that the parent had the right to set boundaries, while others might think there's a better way without involving homelessness. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the parent is not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their son become independent, but the method is debatable. However, since the son eventually succeeded, maybe the parent's approach was effective despite being harsh. The parent did offer a condition (barber school) after the shelter, which shows they still supported him. So, the answer is B.\n"
