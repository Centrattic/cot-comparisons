This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both angles. The author's son was an adult, 23 years old, and had been struggling with jobs for years. The parent tried to encourage him to find a trade but he wasn't successful. The parent eventually sold their house and decided to move, giving the son an ultimatum. When the son didn't comply, the parent sent him to a homeless shelter as a last resort. The son later went to barber school and is now working.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the parent isn't in the wrong for making a choice about their living situation. The son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, ethically, sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. But the parent did reach out to the shelter and found a bed, which might be considered a responsible approach rather than abandoning the son. The parent also offered a way out later by allowing the son to come back if he went to barber school, showing a willingness to help once the son took initiative.\n\nOther factors: The parent tried multiple times to help the son find a path, and when that failed, they took action to move on with their own life. The shelter was a temporary measure to push the son to become independent. The son eventually succeeded, which suggests the approach worked. However, the method of sending him to a shelter could be seen as extreme, but given the context, it might be a necessary step for the parent's own well-being and the son's growth.\n\nConsidering societal norms, parents often struggle with how to handle adult children who aren't contributing. In this case, the parent made a tough decision that led to positive change. The key is that the action was meant to enforce independence, even if it was harsh. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
