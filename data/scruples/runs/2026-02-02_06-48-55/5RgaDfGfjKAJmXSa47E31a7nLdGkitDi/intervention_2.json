This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The story is detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the son was 23, didn't hold jobs, and was resistant to getting a job. The mother tried to push him into trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. When she sold the house, she sent him to a shelter. He later went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nNow, the question is whether this action was wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but they want to know what I think. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents have a duty to care for their children until they become adults. Once a child is an adult, parents aren't legally obligated to support them. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as a harsh measure. But considering the son's behavior, the mother might have been trying to force independence.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. Parents often want to help their kids, but there's a line between support and enabling. If the son was self-sufficient, maybe there's a different approach. But if he was dependent and not taking responsibility, the mother's action could be seen as a last resort. However, using a homeless shelter as a method might be extreme. There could be alternative solutions like finding him a job, setting strict boundaries with support, or involving other family members or social services.\n\nThe mother's intention was to make him take responsibility, which is understandable. But the method was harsh. The son eventually turned his life around, which shows it worked, but at what cost? The emotional impact on both the mother and son could be significant. Also, the mother's action could be seen as a failure to provide support in other ways before resorting to the shelter. Maybe there's a middle ground where the mother could have offered more guidance or resources rather than abrupt removal.\n\nIn some cultures or communities, parents might have different approaches. Some might see this as necessary tough love, while others might think it's too harsh. The mother might not have considered other options like allowing him to stay but with strict conditions, like contributing to household expenses or attending job training programs with support. The fact that the son eventually went to barber school and became independent is a positive outcome, but it's unclear if the shelter was the best way to get there.\n\nIn summary, while the mother's goal was to encourage independence, the method of sending him to a homeless shelter without prior alternatives might be considered excessive. There could have been more constructive ways to push him towards responsibility without subjecting him to such a drastic measure. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
