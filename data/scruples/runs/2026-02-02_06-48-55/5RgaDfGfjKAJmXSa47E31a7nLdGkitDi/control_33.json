This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The son was 23, didn't hold jobs, and the parent felt they had to intervene. The parent sold the house, moved, and when the house sold, sent the son to a shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nLegal aspects: At 23, the son is an adult. Parents aren't legally obligated to support him. But sending him to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. Are there other options? Maybe. The parent could have cut off financial support but allowed him to leave on his own. However, the parent might not have felt they had a choice, especially if the son was resistant to change.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The parent's intention was to push the son to independence. The method was extreme, but the outcome was positive. The son now has a job and lives independently. However, using a homeless shelter might be unnecessary if other forms of support or intervention were available. For example, rehab programs for addiction, career counseling, or more structured support systems. \n\nThe parent might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help their son become self-sufficient. But the approach could be criticized for being too drastic without exhausting other options. Some might argue that sending an adult child to a shelter could have emotional or psychological harm, even if the intention was good. \n\nOther factors: The parent mentions they tried talking to the son for years, he kept quitting jobs, and the parent felt they had \"had enough.\" The parent also offered a condition for the son to return. The son eventually succeeded, so maybe the method worked, but does that justify the means?\n\nIn some cases, parents might use financial cutoffs or require living arrangements that aren't as extreme. The use of a homeless shelter might be more about shock value than a constructive step. However, given the son's history of resistance and inaction, maybe the parent felt this was the only way to get through to him. \n\nThe question is whether there's a better way. The parent admits they're unsure and asks how others handle adult kids. It's possible that other methods could have worked, but without knowing the full context of the son's behavior and the parent's attempts, it's hard to say. \n\nUltimately, the parent's action was a form of tough love. While harsh, it led to a positive outcome. Whether it's right or wrong depends on the perspective. Legally and in terms of intent, the parent might not be in the wrong. But ethically, some might argue it's too extreme. However, the parent's answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given the outcome and the parent's intention to help, I might lean towards B, but there's a gray area. However, since the parent's action was a last resort after years of inaction from the son, and it worked, B might be the choice here.\n"
