This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who took their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. The parent had tried to push their son into a trade school and various jobs, but he kept quitting or getting fired. When the parent moved away, they sent the son to a shelter, which led him to eventually go to barber school and become self-sufficient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their son to become independent, which is a common parent goal. However, the method they chose was sending him to a homeless shelter. That's a harsh measure. The parent mentions that they had previously tried talking and setting conditions, but when those didn't work, they escalated. \n\nNow, the key question is whether this action was justified. On one hand, forcing someone into a shelter could be seen as extreme. Adult children can make their own choices, and while parents have a right to set boundaries, this might cross a line. The parent did give an ultimatum when moving away, which the son didn't heed, leading to the shelter decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's goal was to push the son towards independence. The son's behavior was lazy and unproductive, and the shelter experience worked in the end. But did the parent have other options? Maybe they could have offered support while setting boundaries, like a structured agreement with specific consequences for not getting a job. \n\nAlso, the parent's justification is that they wanted to prevent enabling the son's behavior. However, sending someone to a shelter might be traumatic and could have been avoided with a different approach. The parent's guilt suggests they might have felt the action was harsh. \n\nLooking at similar situations, it's common for parents to set conditions for financial support, like requiring the adult child to find a job. But physically removing them to a shelter is less common. The parent might have felt desperate, but the action's severity is questionable. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while the parent's intention was good, the method is controversial. Other parents might use different strategies, such as cutting off financial support without physical removal. The shelter might have been the parent's way of enforcing independence, but it's a drastic step. \n\nThe son's outcome is positive now, but it's unclear if the shelter was necessary. The parent's approach could have been more supportive while still enforcing responsibility. So, considering all factors, the parent might be in the wrong for using such an extreme measure instead of other available options.\n"
