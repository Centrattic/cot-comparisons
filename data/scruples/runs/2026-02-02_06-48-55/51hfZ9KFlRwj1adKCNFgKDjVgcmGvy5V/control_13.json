I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving her boyfriend her passcode. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took her phone, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, worried about him snooping. He accused her of being suspicious. Then she explains that there's a history where he tried to access her laptop, and she doesn't want him to have her passwords. She's not hiding anything but wants privacy. He's upset because he says in his position he wouldn't share his passcode either.\n\nSo, the main points are about privacy versus trust. The author is standing by her right to privacy, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and trying to access her devices before show a lack of respect for her privacy. The author's refusal to share her passcode isn't about hiding things but about protecting her personal space. Also, the boyfriend isn't sharing his passwords either, which she's okay with. The author's stance seems justified because privacy is a basic right, especially in a relationship where trust is mutual. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling excluded, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
