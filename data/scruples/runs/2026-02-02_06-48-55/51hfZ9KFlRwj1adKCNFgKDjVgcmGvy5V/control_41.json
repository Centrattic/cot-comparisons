I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend.\n\nSo the situation is: the boyfriend took her phone, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She wanted it back, saying not to snoop. He felt she was being suspicious. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop before with her password. She doesn't want to share passwords because she values privacy and he's critical. She also points out he doesn't share his password either. Now they're in a stalemate.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about privacy and trust. She has a right to privacy, and he's shown a tendency to snoop. Even if she has nothing to hide, the fact that he might look through her electronics is a problem. The boyfriend's actions (taking the phone to make a shake, then possibly snooping) might be overstepping. \n\nShe's not sharing her passwords, which is her right. He's upset because he might feel excluded or not trusted, but if he has a history of trying to access her devices without permission, then she's justified in keeping her passwords private. Also, she's pointing out that he doesn't share his either, so there's a double standard there.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he wouldn't share his password doesn't negate her right to privacy. It's about mutual respect. If he respects her privacy, he wouldn't demand her password. So I think the author is in the right here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
