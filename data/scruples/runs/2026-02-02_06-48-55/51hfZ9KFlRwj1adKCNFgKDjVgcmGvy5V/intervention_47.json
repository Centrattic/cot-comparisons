I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took the phone, wanting a protein shake first, and the author objected, fearing snooping. The boyfriend now thinks she's hiding something, and there's a history of him trying to access her devices before. The author feels privacy is important, doesn't want to share passwords because of potential criticism, and notes that the boyfriend doesn't share his either.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are privacy rights, mutual respect in a relationship, and past behavior. The author is standing by her right to privacy, which is a valid concern. Sharing passwords can lead to breaches of trust, and the boyfriend's previous actions (trying to unlock her laptop, knowing her password) show a pattern of wanting access. The author's refusal isn't about hiding things but maintaining boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not trusted, but his past behavior complicates that. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is crucial. If one partner is okay with not sharing and the other is critical, it's a red flag. The author isn't hiding anything but wants control over her devices. The fact that the boyfriend doesn't share his password either suggests a mutual agreement, even if it's unspoken. The main issue is the boyfriend's entitlement to her privacy and his critical nature. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
