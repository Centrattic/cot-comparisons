I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took her phone to get a protein shake, and she didn't want him to snoop. He accused her of being suspicious. There's a history of him trying to access her laptop before. She doesn't want to share passwords for privacy reasons, even though she has nothing to hide. He's upset, and they're stuck.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. People generally have the right to keep their devices secured, especially if there's a history of the other person trying to access them without permission. The boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and possibly snooping could be seen as invasive. She's justified in wanting privacy, especially given his past behavior. The fact that he's critical and might find things to pick on her adds another layer of concern.\n\nAlso, mutual respect in a relationship is important. If he can't respect her boundaries, that's a problem. The fact that he didn't share his own password and then criticized her for not sharing hers seems hypocritical. The key points here are consent, trust, and mutual respect. She's not hiding anything but has a right to privacy. The boyfriend's actions might be overstepping, so the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
