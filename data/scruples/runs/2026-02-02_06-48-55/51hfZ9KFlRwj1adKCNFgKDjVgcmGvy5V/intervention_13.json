I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend taking the phone and wanting access, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone, saying he'd return it once the author made a protein shake. The author then asked for it back, expressing concerns about snooping. The boyfriend accuses her of suspicion, and there's a history where he tried accessing her laptop before. The author doesn't want to share passwords for privacy, even though she has nothing to hide, and she's okay with him not sharing his either. The boyfriend is upset but she's firm.\n\nNow, the key points here: privacy rights, mutual trust, and the boyfriend's past behavior. The author's stance is about privacy, which is a personal right. The boyfriend's actions (trying to access her laptop) show a lack of trust. The author isn't hiding anything but values her privacy. The boyfriend's response to the question about his own password suggests he sees it as personal, which might indicate hypocrisy.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner tries to access the other's devices without consent, it's a breach of trust. The author's refusal to share her passcode is a boundary she's setting, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's anger might stem from a place of insecurity or jealousy, but that doesn't justify his actions. The fact that he hasn't shared his passwords either shows it's a mutual issue, but the author isn't the one initiating the password sharing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. She's asserting her right to privacy, and the boyfriend's past behavior supports her caution. The issue here is more about the boyfriend respecting her boundaries rather than her being wrong for not sharing. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
