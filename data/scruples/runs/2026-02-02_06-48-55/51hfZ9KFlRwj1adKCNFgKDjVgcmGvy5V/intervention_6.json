I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once the author made a protein shake. The author asked for it back, worried about being snooped. The boyfriend took offense, thinking she's hiding something. There's a history here: he and his brother tried to unlock her laptop before, which is a clear invasion of privacy. The author feels she has a right to privacy, even though she has nothing to hide. The boyfriend is critical and might use any information to nag her, like questions about an ex or past conversations. Also, the boyfriend hasn't shared his password either, and she's okay with that. He said if he was in her position, he wouldn't share his password either.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual privacy expectations, past invasion of privacy by the boyfriend, and the boyfriend's controlling behavior. The author is standing up for her boundaries. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is pressuring for access, which could be seen as violating her trust. The author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about protecting her privacy. The boyfriend's actions (taking the phone, trying to get the password) are the real issues here. The fact that the boyfriend hasn't shared his password but expects her to share hers is another point against him. The author is just maintaining the same standard both ways. So, I think the author is in the right. The answer should be B.\n"
