I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it after the author made a protein shake. The author wanted to shower first and asked for the phone back, maybe sounding suspicious. The boyfriend claims he knew her password and that he and his brother tried to unlock her laptop before. That's a red flag right there. If someone has tried to access your devices without permission, that's a big trust issue. The author feels privacy is important, and she doesn't want to share passwords because she knows he might snoop and find things to criticize. Also, he hasn't shared his password with her, and she's okay with that. So there's a mutual lack of sharing, but the boyfriend is upset because he expects her to share hers.\n\nThe key points here are privacy rights and trust. The author has a right to her own privacy. Even if there's nothing to hide, the fact that the boyfriend has previously attempted to access her devices without consent is a serious breach of trust. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic because he's violating her privacy. The author isn't doing anything wrong by not sharing her passcode. The boyfriend is the one who's being controlling and invasive. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
