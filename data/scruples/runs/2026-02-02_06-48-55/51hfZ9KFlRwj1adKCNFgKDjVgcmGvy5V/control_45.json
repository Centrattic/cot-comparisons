I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The scenario involves the boyfriend taking the phone and wanting a protein shake first, and the author not wanting him to snoop. The boyfriend is upset, and there's a history of him trying to access her laptop before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. The author mentions she doesn't have anything to hide but values her privacy. That's a common concern. People generally have the right to keep their passwords private. The boyfriend's actions of trying to access her devices without permission are problematic. If he's already tried to unlock her laptop with his brother, that's a red flag. Trust and respect in a relationship should allow each person to have personal space.\n\nThen there's the part where she's worried about him finding things to criticize, like texts with an ex or old conversations. That's about potential overstepping and being critical, which can be toxic. The boyfriend not sharing his own password might be an issue, but the author isn't upset about that. However, she asked if he'd share his passcode in the same situation, and he said no because it's his password. That shows he's not willing to compromise, which might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nThe key points here are the right to privacy, past behavior of the boyfriend that's invasive, and the mutual expectation of privacy. The author isn't doing anything wrong by protecting her personal information. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling excluded, but that doesn't justify his actions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to privacy, which is valid. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's refusal to share her passcode.\n"
