I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend. I need to decide if it's A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took her phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked him back, saying he shouldn't snoop. He got defensive, thinking she's hiding something. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop before. She doesn't want to share passwords because she values privacy and he's critical. She also points out he doesn't share his, and he said he wouldn't either. Now they're in a stalemate.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about privacy. She doesn't have anything to hide but believes she has a right to it. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is upset because she didn't give the passcode. He's critical and might find things to complain about. The key points here are mutual non-disclosure (he doesn't share his either), his past behavior of trying to access her devices, and her valid concerns about privacy.\n\nIn relationships, privacy is a common point of conflict. Generally, people have the right to their own privacy, especially with electronic devices. Sharing passwords can be seen as invading that privacy. The boyfriend's actions of trying to access her laptop without permission are problematic. The author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about maintaining boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a lack of respect for her boundaries. Since he's critical and has a history of snooping, her stance makes sense. The mutual agreement (he doesn't share either) supports her position. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
