I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once the author made a protein shake. The author asked for it back, worried about being snooped. The boyfriend claims she sounded suspicious. There's a history of the boyfriend trying to access her laptop before, which makes her trust him less. She doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy concerns, even though she has nothing to hide. She also points out that he doesn't share his passcodes either. He's upset, and they're stuck.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy rights versus trust issues. The author's main argument is about her right to privacy. She doesn't share because she's been in situations where her partner might misuse the access. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels entitled to access because of their relationship, which is a common but problematic view.\n\nI need to consider if not sharing the passcode is unreasonable. Privacy is a fundamental right, and even in a relationship, individuals have the right to keep certain things private. The boyfriend's past actions (trying to unlock her laptop) indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries, which justifies her hesitation. The fact that she's okay with him not sharing his passwords shows she's not being hypocritical. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she's protecting her privacy. The boyfriend's anger stems from not respecting her boundaries. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
