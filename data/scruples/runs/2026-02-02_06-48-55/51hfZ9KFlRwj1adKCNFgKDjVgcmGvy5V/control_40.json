I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics.

I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The boyfriend took her phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, worried about him snooping. He felt she was being suspicious. There's history where he mentioned trying to access her laptop before. She doesn't want to share passwords because she values privacy and knows he might find things to criticize. He's upset now, and they're at a stalemate.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy and trust. The author has a valid concern about privacy. She mentions that he has a history of trying to access her devices, which is a red flag. Not sharing passwords is a personal right, especially when there's a risk of violation. The boyfriend's actions of trying to access her laptop without permission are problematic. \n\nHe argues that if she doesn't want him to snoop, she shouldn't hide the passcode. But that's a false equivalence. Everyone has the right to privacy. The fact that he hasn't shared his passcode with her either suggests that there's mutual non-sharing, which is normal. His reaction seems more about control and mistrust rather than a legitimate need. \n\nThe author isn't hiding anything; she's protecting her privacy. The boyfriend's critical nature and potential to misuse information if he had access are also factors. The situation seems imbalanced, with him pushing boundaries she's comfortable with. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's privacy is crucial. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining her boundaries. The boyfriend's frustration stems from wanting access, which isn't justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
