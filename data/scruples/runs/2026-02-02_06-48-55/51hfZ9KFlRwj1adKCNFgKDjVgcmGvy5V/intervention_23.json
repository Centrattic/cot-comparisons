I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The scenario involves the boyfriend taking the phone and wanting a protein shake first, which leads to a conflict about privacy.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone without permission and set a condition for returning it. The author is concerned about privacy because there's prior evidence of him trying to access her devices. She doesn't want to share her passwords and feels justified due to his past behavior. She mentions that he's critical and might find things to pick on her, which adds to her reluctance. Also, she points out that he hasn't shared his password either, so there's some mutual expectation here.\n\nThe key points here are privacy rights and mutual trust. The author isn't hiding anything but values her privacy. The boyfriend's actions (taking the phone, trying to access her laptop) might be seen as overstepping, which the author is reacting to. The fact that he's upset because she didn't give the passcode might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. She's consistent in her stance, not asking for his password either, so it's a two-way issue.\n\nConsidering that the boyfriend made the initial move by taking the phone without permission and the author is standing her ground to protect her privacy, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions might be the root of the problem here. Privacy is a reasonable expectation, especially when there's evidence of the other person trying to access devices before. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
