I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics.

I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once the person made a protein shake, which they wanted to do before showering. The person asked for the phone back, saying not to snoop. The boyfriend interpreted this as suspicion and accused them of hiding something. There's a history where the boyfriend tried to access the laptop with his brother, which they found out. The person doesn't want to share passwords, not because they're hiding things, but for privacy. They mention their boyfriend is critical and might find things to nitpick about. They also note that the boyfriend doesn't share his password either, and when asked if he would, he said no because it's his password to everything.\n\nNow, considering privacy rights. People generally have a right to their own devices and passwords. The boyfriend's past behavior of attempting to access the laptop without permission is a red flag. The person's refusal to share passwords isn't about hiding things but maintaining personal boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction to the request seems to stem from insecurity or mistrust rather than valid concern. Also, the fact that he's critical and might use the information to nag is a good reason to keep it private. The mutual non-sharing of passwords (neither side sharing) suggests a mutual agreement, but the boyfriend's past actions break that trust. The person's stance is reasonable given the context. They're not in the wrong for protecting their privacy against someone who's shown a tendency to overstep boundaries. The boyfriend's anger stems from his own behavior and expectations, not the person's reasonable request for privacy.\n"
