I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with her boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend taking her phone and wanting a protein shake in return, then accusing her of being suspicious when she refuses. She mentions past instances where he tried to access her laptop and now he's upset because she won't share her passwords.\n\nFirst, privacy rights. People generally have a right to privacy, especially regarding their personal devices. Even if there's no specific \"wrong\" action, withholding passwords can be a boundary. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014trying to access her laptop\u2014indicates he might not respect her privacy, which justifies her stance.\n\nThen there's the dynamic of mutual trust. The author isn't hiding anything; she just wants privacy. The boyfriend's critical nature and his own refusal to share his password could show inconsistency. If he's okay with not sharing his own, why is it an issue for her? Also, his reaction of getting angry and accusing her of hiding things might be a red flag in their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, individuals can choose to keep their passwords private. There's no obligation to share them unless there's a specific agreement. The boyfriend's actions in trying to access her devices without permission are more concerning than her refusal to share.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The key points are her right to privacy, his history of trying to access her devices, and the mutual expectation of privacy. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic here.\n"
