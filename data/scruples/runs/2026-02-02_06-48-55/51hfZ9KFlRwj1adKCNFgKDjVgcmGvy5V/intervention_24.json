I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took the phone, wanting a protein shake first, and the author didn't want him to snoop. The boyfriend claims she sounded suspicious, and there's a history of him trying to access her laptop. The author feels she has a right to privacy, and the boyfriend is upset because he says he wouldn't share his password either.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to decide between A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: she doesn't want him to snoop, there's evidence he's tried to access her devices before, she values privacy, and he's critical. Those are valid concerns. Privacy is a personal right, and if someone has a history of trying to access your stuff, not sharing passwords makes sense. Also, mutual trust is important in relationships. If the boyfriend isn't sharing his password either, maybe there's an issue of respect for each other's privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that not sharing the passcode is a lack of trust. But he also took her phone without permission, which is a problem. His actions of trying to access her laptop before show a breach of trust. The author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about protecting her privacy from someone who might misuse access.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's stance seems justified. She's protecting her privacy against someone who's shown a tendency to invade it. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, not hers. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
