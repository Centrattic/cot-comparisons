I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The boyfriend took the phone to make a protein shake, and when she asked for it back, she mentioned not wanting him to snoop. He got defensive, saying she sounded suspicious.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior is a red flag. He previously tried to access her laptop without her consent, which is a breach of privacy. That history makes her reluctance valid. She has a right to privacy, especially since he's been critical of her past interactions. His critical nature is another issue here; even if she had nothing to hide, his tendency to find fault is a problem.\n\nShe's not hiding anything, just maintaining boundaries. It's mutual; he doesn't share his passwords either. She asked if he would share his in the same situation, and he said no. That shows he's being hypocritical. He's upset now, but the real issue is his invasion of her privacy and lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. Considering he violated her privacy before and she's justified in wanting to protect her personal information, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and attitude are the main problems here. So the answer should be B.\n"
