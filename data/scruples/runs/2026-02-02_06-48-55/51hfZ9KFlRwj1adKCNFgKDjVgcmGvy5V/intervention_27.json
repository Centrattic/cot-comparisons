I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend taking the phone and the author not wanting him to snoop. The boyfriend claims the author is hiding something, but the author feels it's about privacy.\n\nFirst, privacy rights are important. People generally have the right to keep their devices secure and their information private, even in a relationship. The author mentions that the boyfriend has previously tried to access their laptop, which adds a layer of trust issues. The boyfriend's behavior of trying to look through her electronics is a red flag, making the author's hesitation valid.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he wouldn't share his passcode either is a bit contradictory. If he wouldn't share, then why is he upset that she isn't sharing? It seems like he's not respecting her boundaries. The author is justified in wanting privacy, especially if the boyfriend has a history of being critical and nosy. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions of taking the phone without consent and pressuring for the passcode are problematic. The author's refusal isn't about hiding things but maintaining personal boundaries. In healthy relationships, mutual respect for privacy is key. The boyfriend's anger suggests he's not respecting her limits, which is on him, not the author.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her privacy rights, and the boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n"
