I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend taking the phone and wanting to return it only after the author makes a protein shake. The author objects, citing privacy concerns. The boyfriend accuses her of being suspicious, and there's a history of him trying to access her electronics without permission.\n\nFirst, privacy rights are a big part here. The author doesn't want to share passwords because she doesn't trust him to snoop. The boyfriend has previously tried to access her laptop, which shows a lack of trust and respect for her privacy. The author has a valid reason to protect her data, especially given past behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he wouldn't share his password either is a bit weak because he's using it as a justification for his actions. If he wouldn't share his password, why is he demanding hers? That's a double standard. Also, he's being critical and might find issues with her communications, which adds to the pressure to not share.\n\nThe author isn't hiding anything; she's standing up for her privacy. She's also fine with not knowing his passwords, which shows mutual respect isn't happening from his side. The boyfriend's anger might be because his needs aren't being met, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. Privacy is a fundamental right, and trust is essential in a relationship. If he respects her, he should accept her boundaries without trying to access her devices. The key points here are the history of snooping, the author's right to privacy, and the boyfriend's lack of respect for her boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
