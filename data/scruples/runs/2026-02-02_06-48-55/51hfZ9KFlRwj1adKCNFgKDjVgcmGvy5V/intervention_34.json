I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation involves a boyfriend taking the phone and the author not wanting him to have access. The author mentions that the boyfriend has previously tried to access their laptop, which makes them uncomfortable. They also feel that sharing passwords invades their privacy and that the boyfriend would find things to criticize. The boyfriend is upset now, leading to a stalemate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a right to privacy, which is a significant factor. The boyfriend's behavior of trying to access the laptop previously shows a pattern of wanting to snoop, which the author is justified in resisting. The author isn't hiding anything but wants to maintain boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not trusting the author, but his actions in the past (like trying to unlock the laptop) are problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he wouldn't share his passcode either is a bit contradictory. If he's okay with not sharing his, why is he upset about the author not sharing theirs? That suggests he might be more focused on control than mutual respect. The author's stance is about setting healthy boundaries, which is important in relationships. Privacy is a personal right, and not sharing passwords doesn't equate to hiding something. The boyfriend's critical nature adds another layer, where sharing passwords could lead to unnecessary conflicts.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their privacy and setting boundaries, which is healthy. The boyfriend's actions and reactions are more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
