I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She wanted to shower first. When she asked for her phone back, she said, \"I don't want you to snoop in it!\" He took that as her being suspicious and accused her of hiding something. She admits her phrasing could have been better but is concerned because there's evidence that he's tried to access her devices before. He mentioned knowing her password and that he and his brother tried to unlock her laptop without success. She feels privacy is important, especially since he's critical and might find things to pick on her. Also, she notes that he hasn't shared his password with her, and she's okay with that. When she asked if he would share his password in the same situation, he said no because it's his password to everything.\n\nNow, considering all this, the main issues are privacy, trust, and mutual respect. The author is not sharing her passcode, which is a personal boundary. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a history of trying to access her devices, which is a breach of trust. The author's concern is valid because if someone has tried to access your devices before, keeping your passwords private is a reasonable way to protect your privacy. The boyfriend's argument that he wouldn't share his password either seems to ignore the fact that he's already accessed her devices, which is a key difference. The author isn't hiding anything but still has the right to privacy. The boyfriend's reaction to her request is aggressive, taking her phone and making her do something first, which isn't a healthy dynamic. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. If the boyfriend is critical and would use her private communications against her, that's a red flag. The fact that he hasn't shared his password and she's okay with it suggests that the issue is one-sided. The author is standing up for her right to privacy, which is important. The boyfriend's actions (taking the phone, trying to access her devices) show a lack of respect for her boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing her passcode. The problem lies with the boyfriend's behavior and lack of trust.\n"
