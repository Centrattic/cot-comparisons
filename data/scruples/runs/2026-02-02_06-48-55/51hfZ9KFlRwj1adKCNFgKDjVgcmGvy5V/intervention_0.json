I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took the phone, saying he'd return it after making a protein shake. The author didn't want him to snoop and refused to share the passcode. The boyfriend got upset, accusing her of hiding something. The author mentions past instances where the boyfriend tried to access her laptop, and she's concerned about privacy. The boyfriend didn't share his passcode either.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are privacy rights and mutual expectations. The author isn't hiding anything but values their privacy. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to think that not sharing the passcode is suspicious. The author's reasoning is valid because everyone has a right to privacy, especially in electronics. The boyfriend's behavior of trying to access her devices without permission is a red flag. Also, the fact that he didn't share his own passcode suggests inconsistency in his expectations. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about maintaining boundaries. Even if there's nothing to hide, privacy is a personal right. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from a need for control or insecurity. The stalemate indicates a mismatch in their expectations regarding privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their privacy, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning because he's trying to access her devices without her consent, which is a violation of privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
