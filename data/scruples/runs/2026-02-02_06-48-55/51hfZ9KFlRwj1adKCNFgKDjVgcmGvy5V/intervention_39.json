I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once the author made a protein shake. The author asked for it back, worried about snooping. The boyfriend claims she sounded suspicious. The author mentions past incidents where the boyfriend tried to access her laptop, which makes her reluctant to share passwords. She doesn't want to hide things but values her privacy. The boyfriend is upset and they're at a stalemate.\n\nThe author argues that they don't have anything to hide but still have a right to privacy. The boyfriend, on the other hand, took the phone and tried to access it, which the author sees as invasive. The boyfriend's response about not sharing his own password complicates things further. \n\nThe key points here are trust, privacy rights, and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is not doing anything illegal or unethical by keeping her passwords private. Privacy is a common concern in relationships, especially with technology involved. The boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and attempting to access her devices without permission are more concerning. The author's refusal to share her passcode is a reasonable boundary to protect her privacy, especially given past behavior from the boyfriend.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she doesn't want to be snooped on, and she's justified in setting boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction of being \"super pissed\" might indicate that he doesn't respect her privacy as much as he should. The fact that he hasn't shared his own password and yet expects her to share hers adds to the imbalance here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her privacy. The boyfriend's actions and lack of respect for her boundaries are more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
