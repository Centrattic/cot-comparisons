I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took her phone, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She wanted it back because she didn't want him snooping. He thought she was being suspicious. Then there's history where he mentioned trying to access her laptop. She doesn't want to share passwords for privacy reasons, even though she has nothing to hide. She mentions he's critical and might find things to nitpick. Also, he hasn't shared his password, and she's okay with that. He said he wouldn't share his passcode either if the situation was reversed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy and trust. The author is asserting her right to privacy, which is a common concern. The boyfriend's actions of trying to access her electronics in the past might justify her hesitation. She's not hiding anything, but she doesn't want him to have access because she knows he might find issues. Also, mutual non-sharing of passwords could indicate both have boundaries here. \n\nHe's upset because he felt her refusal was suspicious, but maybe his past behavior (trying to access her laptop) is the real problem. The fact that he took her phone without permission is a red flag. She had a valid reason to not want him to look through her phone, especially with a history of him attempting to access her devices. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Even if there's no actual wrongdoing, the right to personal space is crucial. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a lack of trust, but that doesn't make her wrong for setting boundaries. Since she's consistent in not sharing and he hasn't shared either, it's more about mutual privacy. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her privacy against someone who might misuse access. The boyfriend's actions in the past (taking the phone, trying to unlock the laptop) are more problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
