I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics.

I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took her phone, demanding a protein shake first, and she refused to give him the passcode, citing privacy concerns. He's upset because he feels she's hiding something.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big issue here. The user doesn't want to share passwords because they don't trust the boyfriend to snoop. The boyfriend has a history of trying to access her laptop, which the user found out. That's a red flag. Trust is important in a relationship, but so is personal privacy. \n\nThe user mentions they have nothing to hide but still feel the right to privacy. That makes sense. People have a right to their own devices and personal information. The boyfriend's reaction to her refusal\u2014thinking she's hiding something\u2014could be because he doesn't respect her boundaries. \n\nAlso, the user points out that the boyfriend hasn't shared his password either, which the user is okay with. But when asked if he'd share his passcode in the same situation, he says no. So there's inconsistency there. If he's okay not sharing, why is he upset about her not sharing?\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect for privacy and trust. The user isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by not sharing her passcode. The boyfriend's actions in trying to access her laptop previously show a breach of trust. The user is standing up for her boundaries, which is a healthy relationship practice. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the user isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to protect their privacy, especially given the boyfriend's past behavior. The boyfriend's frustration stems from not respecting her boundaries, not the other way around.\n"
