I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took her phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, worried he might snoop. He got defensive, saying she sounded suspicious. She mentions he's tried to access her laptop before. She doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy, even though she has nothing to hide. He's upset and critical, and she's okay with him not sharing his password either. He said he wouldn't share his if she asked, but that's his password to everything.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy rights, mutual trust, and the boyfriend's past behavior. The author isn't hiding anything but feels her privacy is important. The boyfriend's actions (like trying to access her laptop) indicate he might invade her privacy if he had access. She's setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The fact that he hasn't shared his password either shows mutual non-disclosure, but she's the one being criticized here. \n\nI think the author has a right to her privacy. Unless there's an explicit agreement to share passwords (which there isn't), she isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is about control and trust issues. The answer should be B (No).\n"
