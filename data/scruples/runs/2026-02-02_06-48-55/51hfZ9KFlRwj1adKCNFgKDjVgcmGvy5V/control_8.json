I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. So the main issue here is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She wanted to shower first and asked for her phone back, expressing concern about him snooping. He took it as her being suspicious, and she later admitted her phrasing wasn't great. \n\nThe user mentions past incidents where the boyfriend tried to access her laptop, which probably makes her wary now. She doesn't want to share passwords because she has a right to privacy, and she knows he might find things to criticize. Also, he hasn't shared his password with her, and she's okay with that. He responded that he wouldn't share his password either, which she took as a double standard.\n\nSo, the key points are: her right to privacy, past trust issues, mutual non-sharing but differing justifications. In relationships, privacy is important. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you have to share everything. The boyfriend's actions (trying to access her devices before) are problematic. Her refusing to share the passcode isn't necessarily wrong, especially if she has valid reasons. Also, the boyfriend's reaction being angry might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she's not hiding anything but still values privacy is a strong point. The mutual non-sharing but different reasons (her for privacy, him for it being his password) might show inconsistency on his part. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
