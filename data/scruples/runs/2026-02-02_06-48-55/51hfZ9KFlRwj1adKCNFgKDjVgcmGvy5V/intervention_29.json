I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took the author's phone, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, saying not to snoop. He responded by accusing her of being suspicious. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop. She doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy concerns and past behavior. He's upset now, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nThe author argues they have a right to privacy. The boyfriend's behavior (trying to access her devices) is a red flag. Privacy is a common concern in relationships. The fact that he didn't share his passwords is a point the author uses to justify her stance. The boyfriend's critical nature adds to her reluctance.\n\nIs it reasonable for her not to share? Well, passwords are personal and relate to privacy. Trust is key here. The boyfriend's past actions (trying to unlock her laptop) suggest he might misuse access. The author isn't hiding things but wants privacy. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate he feels entitled to her information, which is a problem.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the boyfriend is respecting her not sharing his passwords, she's doing the same. However, his actions of taking the phone and trying to access her info without consent are problematic. The author's refusal isn't about hiding but about protecting her privacy from someone who has shown a tendency to invade it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior is more at fault here. The author is justified in keeping her passcodes private, especially given his past actions and the imbalance in trust.\n"
