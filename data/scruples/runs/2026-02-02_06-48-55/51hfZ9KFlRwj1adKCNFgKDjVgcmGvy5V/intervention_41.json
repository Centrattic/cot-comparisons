I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend. The author and her long-time boyfriend had a conflict where he took her phone, asking her to make a protein shake first. She didn't want him to snoop, so she refused. He took the phone, and she felt her privacy was being invaded. The boyfriend previously tried to access her laptop, which she left behind, and that situation is mentioned as evidence of his potential snooping.\n\nThe key points here are privacy rights, mutual expectations, and the boyfriend's behavior. The author doesn't want to share her passwords because she's concerned he'll snoop and find things to criticize her about. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels it's his right since it's his own password to everything, but he hasn't shared his with her either. The author is in a stalemate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. In many relationships, people have the right to their own privacy. Not sharing passwords can be a reasonable stance if there's a history of invasion of privacy. The boyfriend's past action of trying to access her laptop without her consent is a red flag. It shows a lack of respect for her boundaries, which justifies her hesitation.\n\nThen, the mutual aspect. The author mentions that the boyfriend hasn't shared his password either, and she's okay with that. So there's inconsistency in expectations. If he's okay with her not knowing his passwords, why is he upset that she won't share hers? That seems unfair. The author's reasoning is that she has nothing to hide but wants her privacy, which is valid. Privacy isn't about hiding things but about having personal space.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being \"super pissed\" might indicate that he's not respecting her boundaries. His taking the phone and then getting upset when she resists could be seen as the problem. He's using his own password situation as a justification, but that doesn't address her specific concerns.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a trusted relationship, sharing passwords isn't necessary for privacy but could be a gesture of trust. But given the history of him trying to access her devices, her refusal is a protective measure. The boyfriend's behavior here seems to be the issue rather than the author's stance on privacy.\n\nSo, putting it together: the author is not in the wrong because she's standing up for her privacy after a history of invasion. The boyfriend's actions (taking the phone, past snooping) are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B for No.\n"
