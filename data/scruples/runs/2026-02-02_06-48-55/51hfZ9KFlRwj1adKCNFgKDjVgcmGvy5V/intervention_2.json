I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The boyfriend took the phone, saying he'd give it back once she made a protein shake, and when she asked for it back, she said he might snoop. He got mad and accused her of hiding something.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is about privacy. They mention that the boyfriend has previously tried to access their laptop without permission, and they don't trust him to look through their stuff. They also don't want to share passwords because they know he might find things to criticize them about. They also point out that the boyfriend doesn't share his passwords either.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he wants access to her phone, and he's upset because she's withholding it. But the author's reasoning is about privacy rights. Even if they have nothing to hide, they feel entitled to privacy, which is a common argument in relationships. Trust is a big factor here. If there's a history of the boyfriend trying to access their devices without permission, the author has valid concerns.\n\nThe author also mentions that the boyfriend's reaction was being critical and making them feel accused. The boyfriend's response about not sharing his password is a point in the author's favor, as they are consistent in not sharing. The key issue here is mutual respect for privacy. The author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about protecting their personal space.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's more about respecting boundaries. The boyfriend is pushing for access without consent, which can be a red flag. The author is standing up for their right to privacy, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
