I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took the phone, demanding a protein shake first. The author didn't want him to snoop, so she didn't give the passcode. The boyfriend is upset, thinking she's hiding something. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop, so she's concerned about privacy. She doesn't want him to see texts or messages that might lead to criticism. Also, he hasn't shared his passcode either, and she's okay with that.\n\nThe key points here are privacy rights, mutual trust, and consent. The author has a right to privacy, especially in a relationship where there's a history of the boyfriend trying to access her devices. Even if she has nothing to hide, the fact that he might misuse the access is a valid concern. The boyfriend's actions (taking the phone, trying to unlock the laptop) show a pattern of behavior that invades her privacy. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't about hiding something but maintaining personal boundaries. The boyfriend's expectation that she share her passcode isn't reasonable if it's for his convenience and he hasn't respected her privacy before. Also, his response about not sharing his own passcode if the roles were reversed shows a lack of mutual respect for privacy.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but it shouldn't require giving up personal privacy. The author is standing up for her right to keep her digital space private, which is a healthy boundary. The boyfriend's anger stems from his own behavior, not the author's. So, she's not in the wrong for refusing to share her passcode.\n"
