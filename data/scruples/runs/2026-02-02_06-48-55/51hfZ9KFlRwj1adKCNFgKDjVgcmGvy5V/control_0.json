I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took her phone after she asked for a protein shake before showering, and she didn't want him to snoop. He's upset because she wouldn't give him the passcode, and there's history of him trying to access her laptop. She feels she has a right to privacy and doesn't want to share passwords, even though she has nothing to hide. The boyfriend is critical and would find things to pick on her, and he didn't share his password either.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, privacy is a big factor here. People generally have the right to their own passwords and privacy, even in relationships. The boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and trying to access her laptop without permission are troubling. That suggests he might not respect her boundaries. She's justified in wanting to protect her personal information, especially if there's a history of invasion of privacy.\n\nOn the flip side, the boyfriend might feel hurt or disrespected because she's not trusting him. But trust should be mutual. If he's trying to access her devices, that's a breach of trust. The fact that she's okay with him not sharing his password shows she's consistent, but he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and trust. She's not doing anything wrong by setting a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own insecurity or lack of respect for her privacy. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend needs to respect her privacy and her right to keep her passwords confidential.\n"
