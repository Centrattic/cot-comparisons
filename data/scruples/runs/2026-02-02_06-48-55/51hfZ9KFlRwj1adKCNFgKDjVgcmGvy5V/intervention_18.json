I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She wanted to shower first, so she asked for her phone back, expressing not wanting him to snoop. He took offense, thinking she was suspicious, and there's a history where he tried to access her laptop with the password.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights in relationships. People generally have the right to keep their passwords private, even with partners. The author mentions she doesn't want to share because of past behavior where the boyfriend might snoop or criticize things like texting an ex. Also, he hasn't shared his passwords either, so she's consistent in that regard.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and using it as leverage (giving it back only after she makes a shake) might be problematic. Using a phone this way could be seen as controlling. Also, the fact that he's critical and might use her data against her adds to the concern.\n\nThe author's response was to not share the passcode, which is reasonable if there's a history of privacy issues. The boyfriend's reaction being \"super pissed\" and the stalemate suggest that he might be overreacting, especially since the author didn't actually share the passcode and was just reclaiming her phone.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy is important. If both aren't sharing, that's a form of equality. The boyfriend's behavior of trying to access her laptop before shows a lack of respect for her privacy, which justifies her stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
