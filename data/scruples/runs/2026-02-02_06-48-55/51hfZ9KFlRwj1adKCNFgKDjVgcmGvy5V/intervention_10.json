I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the author's phone, demanding a protein shake first. The author asked for it back, worried about being snooped on. The boyfriend accused her of hiding things. The author has evidence that he's tried to access her devices before, like the laptop incident. She doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy and his critical nature. She also points out that he doesn't share his passwords either. Now, he's upset, and they're stuck.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether not sharing the passcode makes her at fault. Privacy is a big deal here. The boyfriend's actions\u2014taking the phone, trying to access her laptop\u2014suggest he's overstepped. The author has legitimate privacy concerns. Trust and boundaries in relationships are important. If he's been sneaky before, her refusal to share her passcode is a reasonable boundary. Also, mutual trust should mean he respects her privacy without needing access. The fact that he's critical and would find issues (like texting an ex) adds to why she's justified. The answer probably leans towards B, not at fault. But maybe some might think in a relationship, sharing passwords is normal. However, given the context of his past behavior and her valid concerns, her stance is reasonable.\n"
