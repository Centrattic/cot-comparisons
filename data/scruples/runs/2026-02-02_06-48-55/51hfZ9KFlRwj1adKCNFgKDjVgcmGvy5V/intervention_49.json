I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend taking the phone and wanting a passcode to return it, which the author refuses because they don't trust him not to snoop. \n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and trust. The author mentions that the boyfriend has previously tried to access their laptop and would likely snoop if given the passcode. That's a valid concern. Privacy is a fundamental right, and people have the right to keep their personal information secure.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument seems to hinge on the idea that not sharing the passcode implies something to hide. However, the author explains it's not about hiding things but about protecting privacy from potential snooping. The boyfriend's critical nature adds another layer\u2014using personal information found on devices to criticize. \n\nAlso, the author points out the mutual exchange: the boyfriend hasn't shared his passcode either. The author's question to him mirrors their own stance, and his response doesn't address the privacy issue but instead asserts ownership over his password. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't being unreasonable. They have legitimate reasons for their stance, and the boyfriend's actions (taking the phone, attempting access without permission) are more problematic. The author's decision to protect their privacy is justified. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
