I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, worried he might snoop. He claims she sounded suspicious. Then there's a history where he tried to access her laptop with his brother, which shows a pattern of trying to access her devices without permission. \n\nThe author doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy and the fear that her critical boyfriend would find things to criticize. She also points out that he doesn't share his passcode with her, and she's okay with that. However, when she asked if he'd share his passcode in the same situation, he said no because it's his password. \n\nSo, the key points here are privacy rights and mutual respect. The author has a valid concern about privacy. Even if she has nothing to hide, the boyfriend's past behavior (trying to access her laptop) is a red flag. The boyfriend's actions in taking the phone and his critical nature could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe author isn't hiding anything but wants to protect her personal space. The fact that the boyfriend isn't sharing his passcode either makes it a two-way issue. She's not in the wrong for asserting her privacy. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling excluded, but that doesn't justify his actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her privacy rights, especially given his history of trying to access her devices.\n"
