I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once the author made a protein shake. The author didn't want to share the passcode because they don't trust him to snoop, and there's a history of the boyfriend trying to access their electronics. The author feels they have a right to privacy even though they don't have anything to hide. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks the author is hiding something, and there's a mutual agreement not to share passwords.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy, trust, and mutual expectations. The author is worried about their privacy because the boyfriend has a history of trying to access their devices. They don't want to give the passcode because they don't want him to snoop, even though they don't have anything to hide. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels that since he gave his passcode to the author, she should reciprocate. But the author isn't comfortable with that.\n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Everyone has the right to personal space and boundaries. The boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and then trying to access it without permission are concerning. The author's refusal to share the passcode is a way to protect their privacy. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or control, which can be red flags. The mutual agreement that neither shares their passwords suggests that the author isn't being unreasonable. The boyfriend's past behavior (trying to unlock her laptop) supports the author's stance.\n\nTherefore, the author is justified in not sharing their passcode. They have a valid reason based on the boyfriend's history. The boyfriend's anger might come from a place of insecurity or wanting control, but the author's right to privacy is a legitimate concern. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
