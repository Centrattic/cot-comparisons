I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the phone to get a protein shake, and the author didn't want him to snoop. The boyfriend interpreted that as suspicion. There's prior evidence that he might snoop, like trying to unlock her laptop. The author values privacy and doesn't want to share passwords, even though she has nothing to hide. She also points out that he doesn't share his passwords either. He's upset now, and they're at a stalemate.\n\nSo, the main points here are privacy rights, mutual trust, and past behavior. The boyfriend's actions of trying to access her laptop before suggest a pattern of potential overstepping. The author isn't hiding anything but feels the right to privacy. She's consistent in not sharing passwords, and he's doing the same. His reaction seems to be about control or insecurity rather than a valid privacy concern.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the boyfriend can't respect her privacy without trying to access her devices, that's a red flag. The author isn't doing anything wrong by protecting her personal information. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning here. So, the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
