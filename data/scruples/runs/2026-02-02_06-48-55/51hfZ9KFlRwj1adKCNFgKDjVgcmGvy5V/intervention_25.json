I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took the phone before the author made a protein shake. The author asked for it back, worried about snooping. The boyfriend claims she sounded suspicious. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop without success. The author doesn't want to share passwords for privacy, even though she has nothing to hide. She's concerned about his critical nature and the lack of mutual password sharing. The boyfriend is upset, and they're stuck.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, privacy is a key factor here. Even if there's no actual wrongdoing, the right to privacy is a valid concern. The boyfriend's past behavior (trying to access her laptop) supports her hesitation. She's consistent in not sharing passwords, which he doesn't reciprocate. The fact that he's critical adds another layer\u2014sharing passwords could lead to unnecessary tension. \n\nThe author's actions are about maintaining boundaries. Even if she had nothing to hide, privacy is a personal right. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a need for control. The argument about mutual non-sharing (he doesn't share his either) suggests an imbalance in trust. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the boyfriend respects her privacy, he shouldn't push for access. Her stance isn't about hiding things but about protecting her personal space. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting her privacy. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic because he's pressuring for access without respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
