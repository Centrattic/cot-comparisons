I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took the author's phone and said he'd return it once they made a protein shake. The author asked for it back, mentioned not wanting him to snoop, which led to the boyfriend feeling accused and making claims about the author hiding things. The author also points out past instances where the boyfriend tried to access their laptop and might be critical if he found certain things. Additionally, the author notes that the boyfriend doesn't share his own passwords, and when asked if he would, he said no because it's his password to everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main argument is about privacy. They don't have anything to hide but believe they have the right to keep their passcodes private. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to take the phone without permission, perhaps as a joke or to assert control, and then accuses the author of being suspicious. The author's concern is valid because the boyfriend has a history of trying to access their devices. Also, the boyfriend's response about his own password suggests a double standard.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of mutual respect for privacy. If the boyfriend took the phone without consent, that's a problem. The author is protecting their personal information, which is their right. However, the way the author phrased their request (saying \"don't want you to snoop\") might come across as distrustful. But given the boyfriend's past behavior, the author's hesitation is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction, assuming the worst and accusing the author of hiding things, might also be an overreaction. \n\nSince the author is asserting their right to privacy and the boyfriend hasn't shared his passwords either, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions in taking the phone and his history of attempting to access the author's devices are issues. The author's refusal to share the passcode is a reasonable boundary. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
