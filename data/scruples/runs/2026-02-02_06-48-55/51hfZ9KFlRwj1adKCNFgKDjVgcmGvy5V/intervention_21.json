I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a person in a long-term relationship) is in the wrong for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The situation involves some past incidents where the boyfriend tried to access the author's electronics without permission. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights in a relationship. Privacy is a significant aspect of personal boundaries. The author mentions they don't want to share passwords because they value their privacy, even though they have nothing to hide. That suggests they feel a right to personal space, which is reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions are also key here. He took the phone and threatened not to return it unless the author made a protein shake. That's a form of coercion, which is not healthy. The boyfriend's history of trying to access her laptop without permission (as mentioned by the author) shows a pattern of behavior that invades her privacy. His response when she asked for her phone back\u2014saying she sounded suspicious\u2014also indicates he may not respect her boundaries, which is problematic.\n\nThe author's concern about the boyfriend finding things to criticize is valid. People in critical relationships might use personal information to belittle their partners. The fact that the author isn't sharing their passcode is a way to protect themselves from potential emotional harm.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's argument that he wouldn't share his password either is a bit contradictory. If he's okay not sharing his own, why is he upset that she isn't sharing hers? That inconsistency might point to his lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. It's important to consider that not sharing personal information isn't inherently wrong, especially when there's a history of privacy violations. The author is setting boundaries, which is a healthy relationship practice. \n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and the context of past behavior make the author's decision to protect her privacy justified. The key points are the boyfriend's previous attempts to access her devices, his coercive behavior, and the imbalance in respecting each other's privacy boundaries.\n"
