I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not sharing a passcode with a boyfriend. So first, I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe author refuses to give their boyfriend the passcode to their phone. They mention that they don't want him to snoop, and there's prior evidence that the boyfriend might try to look through their devices if given access. The boyfriend, on the other hand, took the phone and asked for the passcode to return it after the author wanted to shower. The author feels they have a right to privacy and doesn't want their personal things accessed, even if they have nothing to hide. The boyfriend is upset and critical, pointing out things like messages from an ex or old conversations.\n\nNow, thinking about privacy rights. In most relationships, while partners might expect a certain level of openness, individuals still have the right to privacy in their personal devices. The boyfriend's past behavior of trying to access the laptop without permission is a red flag. Trust is important in relationships, but if someone has already shown they might invade privacy, it's reasonable to protect personal information.\n\nThe author's concern about being criticized for things like texting an ex makes sense. Even if there's no malice, the boyfriend's critical nature could lead to unnecessary conflict. The fact that the author isn't sharing the passcode isn't about hiding something, but about setting boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction being \"super pissed\" might indicate he's not respecting those boundaries. Also, the boyfriend hasn't shared his own passcode either, which the author is okay with. So it's a mutual issue, but the key here is the violation of privacy.\n\nIn legal terms, someone's phone is their personal property, and sharing the passcode can be a personal choice. Unless there's a legal obligation (like in some custody cases or for shared accounts), the author isn't legally required to share. Emotionally and ethically, if the boyfriend respects the author, he should accept her decision without pressure. Pressuring someone to share their passcode can be seen as controlling behavior, especially if there's a history of snooping.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries and protecting their privacy, which is a valid and necessary action in a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's anger stems from not getting what he wants, not from the author's wrongdoing. So the answer should be B.\n"
