I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took the phone and said he'd return it once the author made a protein shake. The author wanted it back, worried about him snooping. The boyfriend accused her of being suspicious. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop, so she's concerned about privacy. She doesn't want to share passwords, even though she has nothing to hide. The boyfriend is upset and they're at a stalemate.\n\nNow, considering privacy rights. In many cultures, personal privacy is respected, and sharing passwords can be a breach. The boyfriend's past actions (trying to access her laptop) show a lack of trust. The author is justified in protecting her privacy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is important. His initial action of taking the phone without consent is a problem. Then, when she asks for it back, he accuses her of hiding things. His behavior might be controlling or invasive. \n\nThe author's reasoning: She doesn't have anything to hide, but she believes in her right to privacy. The boyfriend's potential criticism about her messages (like texting an ex) adds to her discomfort. Also, the fact that he doesn't share his password but expects hers is a double standard.\n\nThe key points are mutual trust and respect. The author isn't hiding anything, just asserting her privacy. The boyfriend's actions undermine trust. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing the passcode. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
