I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe situation is that the boyfriend took her phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, saying she didn't want him to snoop. He thought she was being suspicious. Also, there's a history where he tried to access her laptop before with her password, which he knew. She doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy reasons, even though she has nothing to hide. She also notes that he doesn't share his passwords either. When she asked him if he'd share his passcode in the same situation, he said no because it's his password. Now they're both upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy and trust. The author is within her rights to want privacy. Even if she has nothing to hide, the right to privacy is important in relationships. The boyfriend's actions\u2014taking the phone and trying to access her devices previously\u2014suggest he might not respect her boundaries. The fact that he tried to unlock her laptop shows a breach of trust. The author's response to not share the passcode is reasonable because she's protecting her own devices. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or control issues. Since he himself doesn't share his passwords, there's a double standard. The author isn't obligated to share her personal information unless she chooses to. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
