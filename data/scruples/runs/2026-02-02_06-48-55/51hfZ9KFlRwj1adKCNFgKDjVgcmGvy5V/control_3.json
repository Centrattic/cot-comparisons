I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. So first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author's boyfriend took the phone to make them make a protein shake before getting it back. The author is reluctant to share their passcode because they don't want him to snoop. They mention that the boyfriend has previously tried to access their laptop and told others he knew their password. That seems like a red flag because it shows he might invade privacy.\n\nThe author doesn't have anything to hide but values their privacy. They also point out that the boyfriend hasn't shared his password either. When asked if he would share his password in the same situation, he said no because it's his password. That seems inconsistent. If he's okay with not sharing, why is the author being blamed for the same choice?\n\nThe boyfriend is upset, but the author's actions are about protecting their privacy. They have a valid reason based on past behavior. Privacy is a personal right, and just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you have to share everything. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own feelings of being excluded rather than a justified concern.\n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's history of trying to access their devices and the fact that both are keeping their passwords private, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their privacy, which is reasonable. The boyfriend might need to respect that boundary instead of getting angry.\n"
