I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend took her phone to make a protein shake before a shower. She asked for it back, worried about him snooping. He felt she was being suspicious. There's a history of him trying to access her laptop before, which she's not comfortable with. She doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy and potential criticism. She also points out that he doesn't share his, and she's okay with that. He's upset now, and they're stuck.\n\nThe author's main points are about privacy and trust. She doesn't have anything to hide but values her privacy. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to think she's being secretive, which might stem from his own behavior (like trying to access her laptop) and his critical nature.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, privacy is important. People have the right to their own space, and sharing passwords can be a big deal. The boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and trying to access her devices before are problematic. His reaction to her not wanting to share the passcode might be a power issue or a trust problem. \n\nThe author's stance is reasonable given the history. If the boyfriend is critical and intrusive, maintaining privacy is a valid choice. The fact that he doesn't share his passcode either suggests that maybe he respects his own privacy but expects her to compromise hers. That's a double standard. \n\nSo, the key factors here are mutual respect, trust, and the balance of privacy in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything, just protecting her personal space. The boyfriend's behavior (taking the phone, trying to access her laptop) is more concerning. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
