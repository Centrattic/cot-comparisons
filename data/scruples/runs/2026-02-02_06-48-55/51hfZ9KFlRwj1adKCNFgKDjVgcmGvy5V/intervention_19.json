I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took her phone, wanting her to make a protein shake first. She asked for it back, worried he might snoop. He claims she sounded suspicious. There's a history where he admitted trying to access her laptop, though they failed. She doesn't want to share passwords because of privacy concerns, and he's upset about it. He also mentioned he wouldn't share his password if the situation were reversed.\n\nThe key points here are privacy rights and trust. The author has a valid reason not to share the passcode due to past behavior. The boyfriend's actions of trying to access her laptop without permission show a lack of respect for her privacy. The author isn't hiding anything but wants personal space and to avoid judgment from him. She's also consistent in her stance since he doesn't share his passwords either.\n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, the boyfriend's initial action of taking her phone without consent could be problematic, but the main issue is about sharing the passcode. The author's right to privacy is a significant factor. If the boyfriend respects her privacy, he shouldn't demand access. The author isn't hiding things but wants to maintain boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or insecure, but that doesn't justify violating her privacy.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to privacy, especially given his past behavior. The boyfriend's actions of trying to access her devices without permission are the real issue here. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
