I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Her boyfriend took her phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, worried he might snoop. He thought she was being suspicious. He also mentioned he tried to unlock her laptop before with his brother. She doesn't want to share her passwords because of privacy, even though she has nothing to hide. He's upset, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nNow, considering privacy rights. People generally have a right to their personal devices and passwords. Even if there's no actual secret, the right to privacy is important in relationships. Trust is a big factor here. If the boyfriend has previously tried to access her devices, that's a red flag. His behavior suggests a lack of trust and potential snooping, which isn't healthy. \n\nShe's not hiding anything, but she feels she has the right to keep her passwords private. The boyfriend's reaction and his own refusal to share his password might indicate double standards. Also, his critical nature about things like texting an ex or old conversations is another issue. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's privacy. \n\nSo, the key points are her right to privacy, his past actions, and the imbalance in how they handle password sharing. She's standing up for her boundaries, which is reasonable. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
