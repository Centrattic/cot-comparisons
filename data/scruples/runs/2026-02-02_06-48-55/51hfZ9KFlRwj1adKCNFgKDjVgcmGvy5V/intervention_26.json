I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend took the author's phone, demanding a protein shake first, and then when the author objected, he accused her of hiding things. The author doesn't want to share passwords because she's worried about snooping and his critical nature. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels like she's being secretive and isn't trusting him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. People generally have a right to privacy in their personal devices. The author mentions that the boyfriend has previously tried to access her laptop, which shows a history of invasive behavior. That's a red flag. Trust in a relationship is important, but it shouldn't come at the cost of someone's privacy.\n\nThen there's the aspect of mutual respect. The author isn't sharing her passcodes, and the boyfriend isn't sharing his either. The author is okay with that, which suggests that maybe she doesn't expect it from him. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own control issues than the actual act of not sharing the password.\n\nThe boyfriend's response when asked about giving his passcode was defensive. He said it's his password to everything, which might indicate he's not respecting her privacy by not being open either. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. If one partner has a history of snooping, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is valid. She doesn't want to hide things but values her privacy. The boyfriend's critical nature could lead to unnecessary conflict if he accessed her devices. The author's stance is about protecting herself from potential issues, not about hiding something.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but it shouldn't override personal boundaries. The boyfriend's insistence might be overstepping, while the author is maintaining her boundaries. The fact that he took her phone initially without permission is another issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
