I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe user is a long-time boyfriend who took her phone in the morning, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, saying he shouldn't snoop, and he accused her of hiding something. She mentions that there's evidence he's tried to access her laptop before. She feels she has a right to privacy, especially since he's critical and might find things to complain about. She also points out that he hasn't shared his passcodes either. When she asked him if he'd share his passcode in the same situation, he said no because it's his password to everything. Now they're in a stalemate, and he's really upset.\n\nThe core issue here is about privacy versus trust. The author is standing by her decision not to share passcodes because of past behavior and her right to privacy. The boyfriend is upset, possibly feeling excluded or not trusted. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nIn terms of boundaries in relationships, personal privacy is a valid concern. People have the right to their own devices and passwords unless they choose to share them. The boyfriend's actions of taking her phone and implying she's hiding things may be overstepping. The fact that he's tried to access her laptop before adds to her justified wariness. Trust is a two-way street, and if one person is trying to access the other's devices without consent, that's a red flag. Her not sharing passwords doesn't mean she's hiding something; it's about setting boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction might be a result of his own insecurity or lack of respect for her privacy. The fact that he hasn't shared his passwords either could indicate that he's not respecting her boundaries as well. So, she's not in the wrong for maintaining her privacy and not sharing her passcode. The responsibility lies with the boyfriend for trying to access her devices and not respecting her wishes.\n"
