I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode with her boyfriend. So, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took her phone and said he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She asked for it back, saying she didn't want him to snoop. He thought she was suspicious. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop with his brother. She doesn't want to share passwords because she values privacy. She mentions he's critical and might find things to pick on her. She's also okay with him not sharing his password. He said he wouldn't share either if asked.\n\nSo, the main points are: the boyfriend tried to access her devices before, she's protecting her privacy, he's critical, and there's an imbalance in password sharing. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nLegally and ethically, people have a right to privacy. Sharing passwords can be a privacy issue. The boyfriend's actions (trying to access her laptop) show he might misuse access. The author isn't hiding anything but wants privacy. The boyfriend is upset because he wants access, but she's justified in protecting her personal space.\n\nHe's being critical and controlling by trying to access her phone. She's not wrong to set boundaries. The fact that he doesn't share his password either shows he's not fully open, which complicates things. But the key is mutual respect for privacy. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep her passwords private. The boyfriend is the one acting inappropriately by trying to access her devices. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
