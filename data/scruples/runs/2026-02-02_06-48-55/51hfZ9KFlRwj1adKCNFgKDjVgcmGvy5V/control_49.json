I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics.

I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. The boyfriend took the phone, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake, and she didn't want him to snoop. The boyfriend got upset, thinking she's hiding something. The author mentions that the boyfriend has tried to access her laptop before without success, which makes her reluctant to share passwords. She values her privacy and is worried about him finding things to criticize her about, like talking to an ex or someone from months ago. Also, the boyfriend hasn't shared his password either, and she's okay with that. When she asked if he'd share his password, he said no because it's his.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing her passcode. Let's break it down. Privacy is a personal right, and people often have the right to keep their passwords private even in relationships. The boyfriend's past behavior (trying to access her laptop) is a red flag, which justifies her hesitation. She's not hiding anything, but the potential for invasion of privacy is there. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel entitled to some level of trust or transparency. However, the act of demanding access to her phone without her consent is a boundary issue. The author is standing up for her privacy, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a lack of respect for her boundaries. Since he hasn't shared his password either, there's a mutual aspect here. The key points are mutual privacy expectations and past actions that justify the author's stance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting her privacy.\n"
