I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing their phone passcode with their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend took the author's phone, demanding a protein shake first. The author asked for the phone back, worried about snooping. The boyfriend felt accused, and there's history where he tried to access her laptop. The author doesn't want to share passwords, even though she has nothing to hide, because of privacy concerns and his critical nature. The boyfriend isn't sharing his password either. They're both at a stalemate.\n\nSo, legal and ethical angles. Privacy is a personal right. Even if there's no actual wrongdoing, the right to control one's personal devices and data is important. The boyfriend's past behavior (trying to access her laptop) adds context that he might invade her privacy. The author's refusal could be seen as protecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel trust issues arise from not sharing passwords. But the author isn't the one who initiated the conflict here. The boyfriend took her phone without permission, which is a problem. Also, mutual non-disclosure of passwords could be balanced, but his action of taking the phone is more aggressive.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's stance on privacy is reasonable. The boyfriend's actions were intrusive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
