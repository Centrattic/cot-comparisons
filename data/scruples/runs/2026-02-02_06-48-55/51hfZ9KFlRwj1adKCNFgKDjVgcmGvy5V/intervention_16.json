I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend took the author's phone, saying he'd return it once she made a protein shake. She wanted it back to shower and was worried about him snooping. He accused her of being suspicious. There's a history where he tried to access her laptop, so she's concerned about privacy. She doesn't want to share passwords because she feels it's her right, even though she has nothing to hide. He's upset now, and she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are privacy, trust, and mutual respect. The author is standing by her decision not to share her passwords, citing privacy. The boyfriend's actions (taking the phone, attempting to access her laptop) show a lack of respect for her privacy. She's also pointing out that he doesn't share his passwords either, which adds a point about mutual expectations.\n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Even if there's no actual wrongdoing, the right to personal space is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014snooping and making accusations\u2014can be seen as controlling or distrustful. The author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about maintaining boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from insecurity or a lack of trust. The author isn't doing anything wrong by asserting her privacy. The fact that he doesn't share his passwords either might indicate that there's an issue on his side as well. It's about mutual respect; if he can't respect her boundaries, that's a problem in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her privacy, which is a valid right. The boyfriend's actions and reactions are more problematic here.\n"
