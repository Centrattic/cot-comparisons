I asked for it back, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want you to snoop in it!\u201d He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don\u2019t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (\u201cwhy are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?\u201d etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, \u201cno because it\u2019s my password to everything.\u201d \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now. I think we are at a stalemate. \n\nAITA for not sharing my passcode with my boyfriend? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their passcode with their boyfriend. The situation involves the boyfriend taking the phone, wanting a protein shake first, and the author refusing to give the passcode, citing privacy concerns and past incidents where the boyfriend tried to access her devices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are about privacy and trust. They mention that the boyfriend has a history of trying to access their electronics without permission, which is a valid concern. The author isn't hiding anything but wants to maintain their right to privacy. The boyfriend feels entitled to the passcode and is upset when they don't share it. He also hasn't shared his own passcode, which the author is okay with, but he argues that it's his password to everything.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and relationships. Trust and privacy are both important in a relationship. While some couples might share passwords, it's not a universal expectation. The key here is mutual respect. The author is asserting their privacy, which is their right. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is acting in a way that could be seen as controlling or invasive by trying to access her devices. His argument that he wouldn't share his own passcode doesn't negate his attempt to access hers, especially with the history provided.\n\nThe author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about protecting their personal space. The boyfriend's actions of taking the phone and pressing for the passcode could be seen as overstepping. The fact that he's critical of her messages adds to the concern about potential misuse of the information if he had access.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend's behavior might be more at fault here. The author is standing up for their privacy, which is justified given the past incidents. They are not hiding anything but are protecting themselves from potential snooping. The author's stance is about maintaining boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction of being \"super pissed\" suggests he might not respect her boundaries, which could be a bigger issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on past behavior and the right to privacy. The boyfriend's actions and attitude are more problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
