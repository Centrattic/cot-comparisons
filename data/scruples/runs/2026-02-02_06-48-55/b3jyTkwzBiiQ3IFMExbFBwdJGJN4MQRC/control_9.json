      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the question again.\n\nThe situation is that the author eats leftovers from other people's tables in restaurants or cafes when those people leave. The author's girlfriend and others in their company are upset about this, finding it disgusting and embarrassing. The author argues that it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the social norms. In most places, taking someone else's leftovers without permission is generally considered rude or inappropriate. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without asking could be seen as violating personal space or boundaries. People might feel uncomfortable that someone is going through their trash, metaphorically speaking.\n\nThen there's the issue of consent. The author isn't getting permission from the people who left the food. Even if the food is being wasted, taking it without asking could be seen as stealing. Restaurants might have specific policies about this, but even if not, social etiquette usually requires asking or at least not taking without permission.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But in social settings, there are unspoken rules that people follow to respect each other. If the author's behavior is causing embarrassment and distress to their girlfriend and others, then it's affecting others negatively. The author is prioritizing their own convenience over the feelings of those around them.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that reducing waste is positive. However, the method of doing so by taking others' leftovers without permission might not be the best approach. There are other ways to handle food waste, like donating to food banks if the restaurant allows it, or simply finishing your own meal.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important here. If the author's actions are making others uncomfortable, especially their partner, that's a valid reason to reconsider the behavior. Relationships require mutual respect, and the author's insistence on their choice despite others' feelings could be seen as dismissive.\n\nIn summary, while the intention to reduce waste is commendable, the method used is inappropriate. The author is taking without consent, which is a breach of social norms and is causing distress. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
