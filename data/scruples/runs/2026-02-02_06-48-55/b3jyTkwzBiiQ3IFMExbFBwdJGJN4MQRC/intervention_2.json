      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. The author says it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior. The girlfriend and others are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most places, eating someone else's leftovers without permission is generally considered rude or inappropriate. People might see it as invading someone's personal space, even if they're not around anymore. It could be seen as a lack of respect for others' property, even if they left the food behind.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of consent. The people who left the food didn't give permission for others to take it. Even if they're gone, the food is still their property. Taking it without asking could be viewed as theft in some contexts, though maybe not legally, but certainly socially.\n\nThe author's argument is that the food would go to waste, so it's being used instead. While that's a valid point about reducing waste, it doesn't necessarily override the social expectation of privacy and personal space in public settings. People might also argue that restaurants have their own policies on leftover food, and staff might handle it appropriately.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about being embarrassed and finding it disgusting. This suggests that the author's actions are causing discomfort to their companions. Respecting others' feelings is an important part of social interactions. Even if the author doesn't see it as wrong, others are affected by their actions.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for misunderstanding. If someone returns to their table after leaving, the person taking the food could cause a scene or conflict. It's risky and could lead to confrontations.\n\nHowever, there's also a counterargument about reducing food waste. In a world where food waste is a significant issue, some might sympathize with the author's intention. But intentions don't always justify the action if it breaches social norms.\n\nSo, weighing the social norms against the intention to reduce waste, I think the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong. The action is likely seen as inappropriate and inconsiderate, even if the motive is to prevent waste. The author's stance of it being their choice might not take into account the social context and the feelings of others around them.\n"
