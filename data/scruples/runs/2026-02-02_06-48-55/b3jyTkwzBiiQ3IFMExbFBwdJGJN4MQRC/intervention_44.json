      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. Their girlfriend and others get upset, but they argue it's their choice. I need to determine if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, from a social etiquette perspective, taking someone else's food without permission is generally considered rude. People might leave food for various reasons\u2014maybe they're done, or maybe they're saving it. Taking it could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. Even if the food would be thrown away, that's not the restaurant's responsibility to handle that way. Restaurants might have their own policies on leftover food, like donating it or composting.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The author isn't asking the others' permission before taking the food. Even if the tables are adjacent, it's not public property. Eating someone else's leftovers without their knowledge or consent is a breach of personal space and boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling embarrassed, which is a valid social concern. Public actions can affect others' comfort levels, especially in a relationship where mutual respect is important.\n\nThe author's argument that it's their choice to eat the leftovers might stem from a place of not wanting to waste food. However, their actions affect others around them. The girlfriend's discomfort is a valid reason to reconsider the behavior. While the intent to reduce waste is noble, the method is problematic. There are more socially acceptable ways to handle food waste, like donating leftovers to a shelter or composting through the restaurant's program.\n\nLegally, it's unlikely that the author is breaking any laws, but socially, they're violating norms. The question is about being in the wrong in a social context, not a legal one. The key issue is respecting others' boundaries and considering the feelings of those around them. The author's dismissal of their girlfriend's feelings by saying it's their choice shows a lack of consideration for her perspective, which can be seen as insensitivity.\n\nSo, combining social etiquette, respect for others' space, and consideration of others' feelings, the author is likely in the wrong. Their actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, disregard the comfort and boundaries of those around them, especially their partner.\n"
