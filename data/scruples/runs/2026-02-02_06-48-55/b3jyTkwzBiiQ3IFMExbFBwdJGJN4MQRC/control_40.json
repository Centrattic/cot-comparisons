      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The question is from the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, so it's a moral dilemma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author takes food from other tables when the people leave. Their girlfriend and others disapprove, finding it disgusting and embarrassing. The author argues it's their choice and that others shouldn't control them.\n\nI should think about social norms. In most cultures, taking someone else's food without permission is considered rude. Even if the food is left over, the original owners might not have intended for it to be taken. Restaurants might have policies against this, even if it's not enforced. Also, the author's companions are upset, which affects their social interactions. The author's justification is about reducing waste, but there are better ways to handle food waste, like donating to food banks or ensuring the restaurant has a proper disposal system. The author's actions might also cause discomfort to others nearby, making them feel their belongings aren't safe. Legally, the food is the restaurant's property once the customers leave, but taking it without permission could still be seen as theft. The key points are respecting others' property, social etiquette, and considering others' feelings. Even if the author is trying to be helpful, the method is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
