The people in my company (especially my girlfriend) say I'm disgusting and embarrassing, and they usually get pretty mad at me. Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author justifies it by saying the food would go to waste. But their girlfriend and others disapprove, finding it disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms here. Even if the food is left uneaten, taking it without permission could be seen as violating others' property rights. Restaurants might have their own policies about this. Also, from a social standpoint, it's about respecting others' belongings and the unspoken rules in public places. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, the act of taking it without asking might be considered intrusive or inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's defense is about their choice and autonomy, but that might not override the expectations of privacy and respect in public spaces. Others might feel that the author is overstepping, which could explain why their girlfriend is upset. So, while the intention to reduce waste is understandable, the method might be inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
