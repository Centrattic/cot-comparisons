The people in my company (especially my girlfriend) say I'm disgusting and embarrassing, and they usually get pretty mad at me. Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who takes others' leftovers at restaurants is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, consider restaurant policies. Most places have rules about not taking others' food. It's possible that staff might be upset if they find out, and some places might even have a no-leftovers policy to prevent cross-contamination or for health reasons.\n\nThen there's social etiquette. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without permission could be seen as intrusive or rude. People might feel their personal space is invaded, especially if they're not around anymore. The girlfriend and friends are upset, which suggests that socially, it's frowned upon.\n\nHygiene is another angle. Leftover food could be contaminated or not stored properly after being left out. Eating it might pose a health risk, even if the intention is to save food. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's their choice, but in public spaces, actions can affect others. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that this behavior affects their relationship, which complicates things. The author might be prioritizing their own convenience over others' comfort and health.\n\nLegally, the food belongs to the restaurant until it's thrown away. Taking it without permission could be theft, though it's unlikely to be prosecuted unless it's a pattern. Still, the ethical aspect is about respecting others' property and social norms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the consensus would likely be that the author is wrong. They are disregarding social norms, possibly health concerns, and the feelings of those around them. The answer is A.\n"
