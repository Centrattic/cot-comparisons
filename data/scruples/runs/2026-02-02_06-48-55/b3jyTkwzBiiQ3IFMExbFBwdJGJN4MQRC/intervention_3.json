      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're eating leftovers from other people's tables in restaurants when those people leave. Their girlfriend and others disapprove, but the author thinks it's their choice and feels it's wasteful otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most places, I think taking someone else's food without asking is frowned upon. Even if the food is left behind, people might feel it's an invasion of privacy or a breach of etiquette. Restaurants might have policies against this too. The author might be saving food from going to waste, which is a good intention, but the method is questionable.\n\nThen there's the aspect of others' feelings. The girlfriend and company are upset, which suggests that the author's actions are causing discomfort. Even if the author thinks it's their choice, the impact on others matters. Respect for others' property and personal space is important in social settings.\n\nLegally, maybe the restaurant owns the food, so taking it without permission could be theft. But the author is taking leftovers after the bill is paid. Not sure about the legal side here, but socially, it's probably considered rude.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but in a public space like a restaurant, there are shared social expectations. Insisting on personal choice without considering others' discomfort could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because she's directly affected and finds it embarrassing.\n\nSo, balancing intentions vs. actions, the author's actions, while well-meaning, likely violate social norms and cause harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
