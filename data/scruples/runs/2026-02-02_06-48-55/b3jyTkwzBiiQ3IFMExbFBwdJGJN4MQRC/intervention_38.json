Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author defends their action by saying it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. In most cultures, eating someone else's food without permission is generally considered rude and inconsiderate. People might find it uncomfortable or even offensive. The author's girlfriend and others are upset, which suggests that there's a social expectation against this behavior.\n\nThen, the argument about reducing waste is valid. However, the method might not be appropriate. Restaurants often have policies or staff to handle leftover food, so taking it oneself could interfere with their procedures. Plus, the presence of others might make the situation awkward or unhygienic.\n\nThe author's response to criticism by asserting personal choice is a key point. While everyone has the right to make choices, those choices must respect others' boundaries and societal norms. Insisting on one's behavior without considering others' feelings can be seen as insensitive.\n\nLegally, restaurants might not allow this, so there could be a policy violation. Ethically, it's about respecting others' property and the shared space. Even if the food is left behind, it's still meant for the previous customers, and taking it without consent breaches trust and comfort.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction and the upset from others indicate that the author's actions are causing harm to relationships. Relationships require mutual respect, and the author's dismissive attitude might be eroding trust and respect in their partnerships.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention to reduce waste is commendable, the approach is socially unacceptable and harms others' feelings. The author is in the wrong because their actions disregard social norms and others' comfort, leading to valid criticisms from those around them.\n"
