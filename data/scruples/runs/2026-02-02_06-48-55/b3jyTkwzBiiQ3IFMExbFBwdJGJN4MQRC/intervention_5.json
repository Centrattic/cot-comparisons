      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they eat other people's leftovers when the people at nearby tables leave. Their girlfriend and others are upset, and the author is defending their choice by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most places, taking someone else's food without permission isn't considered acceptable. Even if the food is left behind, it's still someone else's property until they leave. Once they leave, maybe the restaurant could handle the leftovers, but taking it yourself might be seen as inconsiderate or even theft, depending on the context.\n\nThe author's argument is that the food would go to waste otherwise. While that's a valid concern about food waste, the solution of taking it without permission might not be the right approach. Restaurants might have their own ways to handle leftover food, like donating it or composting. The author is assuming that their action is the only way to prevent waste, but that might not be true.\n\nAlso, the reaction of the girlfriend and others is important. If people are getting upset, it's a sign that the author's behavior is causing discomfort. Even if the author thinks it's their choice, social interactions often require considering others' feelings. The author's justification of \"it's my choice\" might be seen as dismissive of others' concerns and the social norms of the environment.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. Depending on the restaurant's policies, taking someone else's leftovers could be considered theft. Even if the restaurant doesn't mind, the people who left have already paid for the food, and taking it without their consent could be a problem. The author is taking something that belongs to someone else, even if indirectly through the restaurant.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author is violating social norms, possibly legal policies, and causing discomfort to others. Their justification about food waste isn't sufficient because there are other ways to handle that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
