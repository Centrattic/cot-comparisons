      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author says that when people leave a nearby table, they take the leftovers because otherwise, the food would go to waste. But their girlfriend and others get upset, calling them disgusting or embarrassing. The author then justifies their actions by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I should consider social norms. In most places, taking someone else's leftovers without permission is generally seen as rude or inconsiderate. Even if the people have left the table, the food is still technically their property. Taking it without asking might be seen as stealing, which is against social etiquette. Restaurants might have their own policies about this too\u2014some might allow it, others might not. But the author isn't asking for permission, which is a red flag.\n\nAnother angle is the environmental argument. The author is trying to prevent food waste, which is a good intention. However, there might be other ways to handle leftovers, like the restaurant donating them to a food bank or composting. The author's method could be seen as a personal solution to a bigger problem, but it's not respecting others' boundaries. The people at the table who left might not want their leftovers eaten by strangers for various reasons\u2014maybe allergies, personal preferences, or just not wanting their stuff taken.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She and the others find it embarrassing and disgusting. The author's response, claiming it's their choice and others shouldn't control them, dismisses their feelings and shows a lack of consideration for their comfort. Even if the author has good intentions, the impact on others matters. Social interactions require mutual respect, and this action might be causing discomfort without a valid reason beyond the author's personal choice.\n\nLegal perspective: In some places, taking someone else's food might not be illegal, but it's definitely a breach of social norms. However, the main issue here is more about etiquette and personal boundaries than legality.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is acting on their own choice but ignoring the feelings and social norms that others expect to be followed. While the intention to reduce waste is commendable, the method chosen is inappropriate and disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
