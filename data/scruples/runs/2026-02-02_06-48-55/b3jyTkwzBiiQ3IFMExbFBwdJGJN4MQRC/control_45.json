      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables in restaurants. The author's friends, especially their girlfriend, get upset about this, but the author defends their actions as their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. In many cultures, sharing food or taking someone else's leftovers without permission is generally frowned upon. Restaurants usually have policies against this, and servers might get in trouble if they do it. So from a social etiquette standpoint, the author's behavior is likely seen as inappropriate or even rude.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The people who left their food didn't give permission for others to take it. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without asking could be seen as violating their personal space or property. The author might not be stealing, but they're using items that belong to others without consent. That's a key point here\u2014without permission, it's not really their choice to take it.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But personal freedom has limits when it affects others. The girlfriend's reaction is about being embarrassed and finding it disgusting, which points to the social impact of the author's actions. So even if the author isn't breaking a law, they might be breaching social norms, which can still be considered wrong in terms of etiquette.\n\nAlso, the environmental angle the author mentions\u2014preventing food waste\u2014is a good point. However, there are other ways to address food waste without violating others' expectations. Restaurants might have their own waste management systems, or the author could take their own leftovers home instead. Taking from others isn't the only solution here.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends are upset. This affects their relationships. If the author continues despite the negative reactions, it shows a lack of consideration for others' feelings, which is a sign of insensitivity. The author's stance that others shouldn't control their behavior ignores the social context where such actions have repercussions on those around them.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the author's actions, while perhaps not illegal, are socially unacceptable, lack consent, and cause discomfort to others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
