      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The person says they do this because the food would otherwise go to waste, but their girlfriend and others find it disgusting and embarrassing. They're defending their actions as their choice and resisting being controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, eating someone else's food without permission is considered rude or even theft. Restaurants might have policies against it, and customers generally expect their food to be theirs alone. The author's justification is about reducing waste, but there's a line between being thrifty and violating social boundaries.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The other diners didn't give permission for their leftovers to be taken. Even if they leave, the food is still their property until they discard it themselves. Taking it without asking could be seen as intrusive or inconsiderate.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important. She finds it embarrassing and disgusting, which indicates that this behavior is causing conflict in their relationship. The author's response of asserting their choice and resisting control might be seen as dismissive of others' feelings. Relationships require mutual respect, and if someone's actions are causing distress, finding a compromise is necessary.\n\nAlso, there's the practical side. If the food isn't immediately available (like after the group has left), it's possible the restaurant might not want the leftovers to be taken for hygiene reasons. Plus, there's a risk of allergic reactions or dietary restrictions if the leftovers are consumed without knowing their ingredients.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while reducing waste is a noble intent, the means here might be problematic. The author could explore other ways to prevent food waste, like donating leftovers to a food bank or asking the restaurant if they can take excess food home. Alternatively, they could order their own food and not take from others.\n\nSo considering all these points: social norms, consent, relationship dynamics, hygiene, and alternative solutions, it seems the author is in the wrong. They're not respecting others' property and feelings, even if their intention is to be helpful.\n"
