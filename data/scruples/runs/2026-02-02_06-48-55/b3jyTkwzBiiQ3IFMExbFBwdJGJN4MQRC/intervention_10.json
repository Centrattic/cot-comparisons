      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. They mention that their girlfriend and others are upset, thinking it's disgusting and embarrassing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider norms and expectations in social settings. In most cultures, eating someone else's leftovers without permission is considered rude. People generally expect their food to be for themselves, and taking it without asking could be seen as invading their personal space or being inconsiderate. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, it's not your place to decide that for others. They might have wanted to take leftovers home, or they might have just left quickly and not intended to discard them.\n\nThe author argues that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior. But in social contexts, certain behaviors are expected to maintain comfort and respect for others. Even if the author doesn't see it as a big deal, others might. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's likely concerned about social norms and the author's behavior affecting their reputation or causing discomfort to others.\n\nAnother angle is the potential health aspect. Leftover food might have been in contact with others' hands or lips, which could be a hygiene issue. People might not want others eating food they've touched, even if it's just from the same table. The author might be dismissing others' valid concerns about cleanliness.\n\nThe author's justification that the food would go to waste is noble but doesn't necessarily override personal boundaries. There are other ways to address food waste, like supporting food banks or restaurants that donate leftovers. Taking someone else's food isn't the responsibility of the individual in a public setting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because their action disregards social norms, personal boundaries, and others' feelings. Even if there's a good intention behind reducing waste, the method is inappropriate.\n"
