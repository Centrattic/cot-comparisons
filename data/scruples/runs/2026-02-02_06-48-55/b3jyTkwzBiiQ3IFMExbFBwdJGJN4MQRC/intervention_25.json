Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating leftovers from other tables at restaurants. Their reasoning is that the food would otherwise go to waste. However, their girlfriend and others in their company are upset by this behavior.\n\nFirst, the moral aspect: even though the food is left behind, taking it without permission could be seen as respecting the establishment's property. Restaurants have their own policies on leftovers; some might donate them if not taken by the customers. The person is taking it for themselves, which might override those policies.\n\nSocial norms come into play too. Even if the food is abandoned, it's considered rude and intrusive to take it from another table. People might find it creepy or disrespectful, which explains why their girlfriend is upset. It's about personal boundaries and social etiquette.\n\nThe person's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them might not hold in a social context. While individual freedom is important, public behavior is often guided by mutual respect and unspoken rules. Disregarding others' feelings in this case could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAlso, the person's insistence on their right to do so might come off as dismissive of others' reactions, which could strain relationships. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that this behavior is affecting their social interactions negatively.\n\nSo, considering both the ethical implications and social norms, the person is likely in the wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
