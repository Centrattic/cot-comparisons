      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author says that when people at nearby tables leave, they take the leftovers to avoid waste. Their girlfriend and others are upset about this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, eating someone else's leftovers without their permission is considered rude or inappropriate. Even if the intention is to reduce waste, taking someone else's food without their knowledge or consent can be seen as invading their personal space and respecting their property. \n\nRestaurants usually charge for the food, and the customers have paid for it. The leftovers belong to the people who ordered them. The author's action might be seen as taking something that isn't theirs, regardless of the reason. Even if the food would be thrown away, it's not the author's to take. The restaurant might have their own policies for handling leftovers, or they might donate them, but that's up to the establishment, not individuals.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a point to consider. She finds it disgusting and embarrassing, which indicates that the author's actions are affecting their relationship. The author's response that it's their choice to act that way might come off as dismissive of others' feelings. While everyone has the right to their own choices, it's also important to respect others' boundaries and feelings, especially in a relationship.\n\nThere's also the aspect of public behavior. Eating someone else's food could be seen as intrusive and disrespectful to the original customers, even if they're not present anymore. It's a matter of personal space and respect for others' property. Plus, if the author makes a habit of this, it might make others uncomfortable or feel unsafe, thinking their belongings (not just food) could be taken.\n\nHowever, the author's intention to reduce waste is commendable. Maybe the solution would be to check with the restaurant if they have a policy for leftover food, or to donate it themselves in a more appropriate way. Alternatively, using the leftovers politely, like asking the server if they can take them, but that's probably not feasible when the people have already left.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention to avoid waste is understandable, the action of taking someone else's leftovers without permission is socially unacceptable and disrespectful. The author is in the wrong because they're disregarding others' property and causing discomfort to those around them, including their partner. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
