      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. They mention their girlfriend and others are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends their actions as their choice and says others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, taking someone else's leftovers without permission is seen as rude or intrusive. People generally expect privacy and personal space, especially in public settings. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without asking could be perceived as violating that unspoken boundary.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The original diners left, so they didn't give permission for their food to be taken. The author might not consider that others might have left for a reason, like they're done eating or have plans to come back. Taking their food could be seen as a lack of respect for their belongings.\n\nThe author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them might be a form of individualism, but in social contexts, there are shared norms and expectations. Insisting on personal choice without regard for how others perceive it can lead to conflicts. The girlfriend's anger suggests that this behavior is causing harm to their relationship, which is a personal issue they need to address.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that reducing waste is a good intention, but the method here is questionable. Proper ways to handle waste might involve restaurant staff or composting, not taking from others. So while the intent is positive, the action is socially inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions cross social boundaries, make others uncomfortable, and disregard the ownership of the food. The author is likely in the wrong because their behavior is insensitive to others' feelings and social norms, even if their intention is to prevent waste.\n"
