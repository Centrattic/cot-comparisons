      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. The author says they do this to prevent food from going to waste, but their girlfriend and friends find it disgusting and embarrassing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, taking leftovers that others have left could be seen as reducing waste, which is a positive intention. However, the context is a restaurant where people pay for their food, and taking it without permission might be considered theft or at least inconsiderate. Even if the food is left behind, the diners still paid for it, and taking it without asking could be seen as violating their property rights.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's actions are making their companions uncomfortable. The girlfriend is getting angry, which suggests that this behavior is causing conflict in their relationship. The author's justification of \"it's my choice\" might come off as dismissive of others' feelings and social norms. In many cultures, entering someone else's personal space to take their food is considered rude and intrusive, regardless of the intent.\n\nAlso, restaurants typically have policies about leftover food. Some might donate it, but the author isn't following those channels. Instead, they're taking it directly, which could be against the restaurant's rules and might even be illegal in some places. The author might not be aware of this, but ignorance isn't a valid excuse when it comes to social etiquette and laws.\n\nThe key points here are intention vs. impact. While the author's intention is good, the impact on others is negative. The right thing to do isn't just about the action itself but also about respecting others' comfort and the social contract. So, even if the action isn't a crime, it's still socially unacceptable and insensitive to the people around them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
