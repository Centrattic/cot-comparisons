      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author says that when people at nearby tables leave, they eat the leftovers because otherwise, the food would go to waste. Their girlfriend and others find this behavior disgusting and embarrassing. The author is defending themselves by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nFirst, I should think about the social norms and etiquette around this. In most places, eating someone else's food without permission is generally considered impolite. Even if the food is being left behind, taking it without asking could be seen as intrusive. People might have left the food for various reasons\u2014maybe they ordered too much, or they're done, but it's still their property. The act of taking it without consent might make others uncomfortable, which is why the girlfriend is upset.\n\nThen there's the aspect of food safety. If the food was left out for a while, especially if it's perishable, it might not be safe to eat. The author might be risking foodborne illness by consuming leftovers that weren't stored properly. This isn't just about being polite; it's also about health risks.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author's goal is to prevent food waste, which is a positive intention. However, the method they're using might not be the best approach. Restaurants often have their own way of handling leftovers\u2014maybe donating them or composting. If the author is concerned about waste, perhaps they could talk to the restaurant about their practices instead of taking the food themselves.\n\nThe author's response of saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior is a bit dismissive. While personal freedom is important, social interactions require considering others' feelings and societal norms. Even if the author believes they're right, the impact on those around them (like the girlfriend) is negative, which suggests a lack of consideration for others' perspectives.\n\nI should also consider cultural differences. Some cultures might have different views on sharing food, but in most Western contexts, taking someone else's leftovers without permission is frowned upon. The key here is permission. If the author had asked, it might be different, but taking it without consent crosses a social boundary.\n\nIn summary, even though the author's motivation is to reduce waste, the method is socially unacceptable and potentially risky. The author is not respecting others' property and comfort, which is why their companions are upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
