      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. The author justifies this by saying the food would go to waste, but their girlfriend and friends find it disgusting and embarrassing. They're also defensive, saying it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. Taking someone else's leftovers without permission could be seen as respecting their property or not. Even if the food is left behind, the original owners might not want it taken, especially if they're still paying for the meal. Restaurants usually have policies about leftovers, and staff might handle them. So taking it yourself might be against their rules.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's behavior is causing discomfort to their companions. Even if they personally don't see it as a problem, the social norm is that people value their own food and belongings. Eating someone else's leftovers without asking could be considered rude or intrusive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's affecting their relationship and social interactions.\n\nThe author's argument about reducing waste is a good point, but there are better ways to address food waste, like donating leftovers through organized programs or supporting restaurants that do. Taking it directly from other tables is a gray area in terms of ethics and etiquette.\n\nAlso, the defensiveness\u2014saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them\u2014might be dismissive of others' feelings. In social settings, respecting others' comfort levels is important, even if you have your own justified reasons.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're violating social norms, respecting others' property, and not considering the feelings of their companions. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
