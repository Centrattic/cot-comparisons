      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person says they eat leftovers when others leave, to prevent them from being thrown away. Their girlfriend and others in their company find this disgusting and embarrassing. They're defending their behavior by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nSo, the main points here are: taking leftovers from other tables, the intention to avoid waste, and the social backlash. The question is whether this action is wrong or not.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, eating someone else's food, even if it's leftovers, is generally considered inappropriate. People might see it as an invasion of privacy or a lack of respect for others' property. Even if the food is left behind, there's an unspoken assumption that once you're seated at a table, the food is theirs. Taking it without permission could be seen as stealing, even if they're not using it anymore.\n\nHowever, the person's intention is to prevent waste, which is a positive motive. But intentions don't always make an action socially acceptable. For example, if someone leaves their food, maybe they have allergies, or the food is partially eaten and not safe to consume. There could be health or safety concerns too.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about being embarrassing and disgusting. That's a strong social disapproval. In many cultures, sharing tables or taking food from others isn't a norm, so this action might be frowned upon. The person might be violating social norms even if their intent is good.\n\nThe author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior is a bit of a stretch. While personal freedom is important, actions in public spaces often affect others and are subject to social norms. If the action is causing discomfort to those around them, it's a matter of social responsibility.\n\nAlso, the restaurant's policy might play a role. Some places might have rules against taking food from other tables, but the author doesn't mention checking that. Even if the policy isn't explicit, common courtesy usually prevails.\n\nSo, balancing the waste prevention motive against the social norms and potential health issues, the person is likely in the wrong. Their actions, while well-meaning, could be seen as inconsiderate. The right answer would be A.\n"
