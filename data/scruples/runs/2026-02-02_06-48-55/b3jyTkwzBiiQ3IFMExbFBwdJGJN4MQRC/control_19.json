      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants when those people leave. The main points are: they do this to avoid waste, but their girlfriend and others think it's gross and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around restaurant etiquette. Typically, when someone leaves a table, the staff is supposed to clean up the leftovers. If the person is taking food from another table that's been left behind, that's not their food. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without permission could be seen as stealing. Restaurants might have policies against this, even if it's just leftovers.\n\nAlso, from a social standpoint, entering another person's personal space (their table) to take their food might make others uncomfortable. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this behavior is not socially acceptable to her and others. The author is defending it as their choice and resisting being controlled, but in public spaces, actions can affect others around you, which might justify the others' concerns about being embarrassed or disgusted.\n\nEven if the intention is to prevent waste, there's a better way to handle it, like informing the staff. The author might be overlooking the restaurant's role in managing leftovers. Moreover, taking others' food without asking could be considered disrespectful or intrusive. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
