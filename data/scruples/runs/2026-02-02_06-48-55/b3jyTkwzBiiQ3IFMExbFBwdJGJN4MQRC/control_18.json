      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who takes leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants is in the wrong. The question is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so it's probably a moral dilemma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The author is eating food left by others when they leave. They argue that the food would be thrown away otherwise, and they're just being practical. But their girlfriend and others are upset, saying it's disgusting and embarrassing. The author is defending their choice and resisting being controlled. \n\nSo, the key points here: Is taking others' leftover food without permission wrong? Well, legally, maybe not. Once someone leaves the table, their food is technically abandoned. But socially, it's a different story. Restaurants usually handle leftovers by throwing them out, not meant for others to take. It could be seen as intrusive or violating others' privacy. \n\nAlso, the author is in a public setting, so others might find it creepy or unhygienic. Even if the food is going to be wasted, the act of taking it without asking could make others uncomfortable. The girlfriend's reaction is about the social embarrassment and the author's insensitivity to others' feelings. \n\nFrom a social behavior perspective, even if the action isn't illegal, it's considered rude. People expect their leftovers to be left alone. The author's argument that it's their choice might overlook the social norms and the impact on others. They might not be respecting the personal space and belongings of others, even if the items are left unattended. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily breaking any laws, they are violating social etiquette. The girlfriend's perspective is about maintaining social norms and not making others uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions are socially inappropriate and disrespectful, even if they have a logical reason.\n"
