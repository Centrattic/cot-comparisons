      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. Their friends and girlfriend are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends themselves by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone else leaves their food, taking it might be seen as impolite or intrusive. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, eating someone else's leftovers without permission could be considered respecting their belongings. Restaurants might have policies against this, but the question is about social etiquette, not legal issues.\n\nThe author's argument is about personal choice and freedom. However, in social settings, behavior that affects others can be a matter of respect. If others are uncomfortable or embarrassed by this action, it's possible the author is disregarding their feelings. The girlfriend getting mad suggests that this behavior is causing interpersonal conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for causing discomfort or making others feel unsafe. People might not want their leftovers touched by strangers, even if they're going to dispose of them. There's also a hygiene aspect, though it's not the biggest factor here.\n\nThe author's insistence on their right to do so might come off as dismissive of others' feelings. Social interactions often require balancing personal freedom with consideration for others. While the intention to reduce waste is commendable, the method might be inappropriate. So, the author might be in the wrong because their actions are causing distress to companions and violating social norms.\n"
