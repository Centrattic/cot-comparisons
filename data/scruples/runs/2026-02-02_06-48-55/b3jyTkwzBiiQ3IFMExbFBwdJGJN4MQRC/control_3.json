      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person goes to a restaurant or cafe, and when people at nearby tables leave, they take the leftovers. The reasoning is that the food would otherwise go to waste. However, their partner and friends find this behavior disgusting and embarrassing, and the person is defending their choice by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nSo, what's the ethical angle here? Taking someone else's leftovers without their permission is a gray area. On one hand, reducing food waste is a good intention. On the other hand, taking someone else's property, even if it's going to be thrown away, could be seen as an invasion of privacy or a breach of social norms. Even if the food is left behind, it might not be the customer's to give away; some places might have policies against that. Also, the reactions of the girlfriend and friends suggest that this is socially unacceptable to others, which could lead to embarrassment or conflict.\n\nThe person's argument is about personal choice and autonomy. But in social settings, especially in public places like restaurants, there are unspoken rules about personal space and belongings. Even if the leftovers are technically discarded, taking them might be considered impolite or disrespectful. The key here is whether the action is respecting the boundaries of others. The person is not just making a choice for themselves but possibly disregarding the comfort and norms of those around them, including their companions.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that this behavior affects their relationship. The person's insistence on their right to do this despite others' disapproval might be seen as inconsiderate. The ethical principle here might involve balancing individual freedom against social responsibility and respect for others' feelings.\n\nSo, while the intention to prevent waste is commendable, the method of doing so by taking others' leftovers without their consent is likely considered wrong. The person is overriding the preferences of those with them and possibly violating social norms, which makes them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
