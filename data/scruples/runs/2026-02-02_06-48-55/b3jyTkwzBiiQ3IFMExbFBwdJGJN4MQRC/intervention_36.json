      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for eating other people's leftover food at restaurants. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author goes to a restaurant or cafe, and when people at nearby tables leave, they eat the leftovers. Their girlfriend and others in their party are upset, calling the author disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends their behavior by saying it's their choice and that others shouldn't control them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nI need to consider the social norms and possible ethical implications here. Eating someone else's leftovers in a public place like a restaurant is generally considered inappropriate. Even though the food might be thrown away, taking it without permission could be seen as an invasion of privacy or a violation of personal space. People might leave food for various reasons\u2014maybe they ordered too much, or they're done, or they have dietary restrictions. Taking it without asking could be perceived as disrespectful.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But in social settings, we often have unspoken rules to respect others' belongings and boundaries. Just because something might be wasted doesn't give someone the right to take it without permission. There's also the aspect of public perception; even if the author isn't stealing, the act might make others uncomfortable or feel disrespected.\n\nThe girlfriend and others in the group are upset, indicating that this behavior is causing conflict in their social relationships. The author's insistence on their right to do this without considering others' feelings could be seen as insensitive. While the author might not be breaking any laws, they are likely violating social etiquette, which can lead to being perceived as an asshole in the AITA context.\n\nAnother angle: restaurants often have policies about how long they leave food out before cleaning up. Maybe the author's actions interfere with those processes or create extra work for staff. It's also possible that some food is meant to be taken home or disposed of in a specific way by the customers.\n\nIn summary, even though the author's intention is to reduce waste, the method of doing so without permission and disregarding others' discomfort is problematic. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions cross social boundaries and cause distress to their companions.\n"
