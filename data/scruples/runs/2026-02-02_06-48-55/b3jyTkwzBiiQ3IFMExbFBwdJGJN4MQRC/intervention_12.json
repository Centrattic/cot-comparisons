      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author's justification is that the food would otherwise go to waste, but their girlfriend and companions are upset, calling it disgusting and embarrassing. The author is defending their choice as personal and not subject to others' control.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. In most cultures, taking someone else's leftovers without their permission is considered rude or inappropriate. Even if the food is left behind, the act of taking it can be seen as impolite because it invades others' personal space and might be perceived as a lack of respect for their property and boundaries. The fact that others are upset suggests that the author is violating social expectations.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The people who left their food didn't give permission for it to be taken. Even if they weren't eating it anymore, the act of taking it without asking could be seen as theft, depending on local laws. While the value might be low, the principle is about respecting others' belongings.\n\nThe author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior is a bit problematic. While personal freedom is important, it's not absolute, especially in social settings where mutual respect is key. The right to make personal choices is balanced by the need to respect others' feelings and space. So even if the author isn't breaking a law, they're likely transgressing social norms, leading to the reactions from their companions.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. Relationships involve mutual respect and consideration. If the author's actions are causing distress to their partner, it's a valid concern. The author's response to dismiss that feedback as control could indicate a lack of empathy, which is a key factor in AITA judgments.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: some might argue that reducing food waste is a positive action. But the method of doing so by taking from others without consent might not be the best approach. There are more appropriate ways to handle leftovers, like asking the restaurant to donate food or not taking it in the first place.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention to reduce waste is understandable, the method of taking others' leftovers without permission is socially unacceptable and causes harm to others' feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
