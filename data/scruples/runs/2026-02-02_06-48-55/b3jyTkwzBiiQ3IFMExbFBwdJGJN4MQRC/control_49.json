      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The girlfriend and others are upset, but the author thinks it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, eating someone else's leftovers without permission is seen as rude. People might find it invasive or unsanitary. Even if the food is going to waste, taking it without asking could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThen there's the aspect of respecting others' property. When someone orders food, it's their choice to leave it. Taking it without consent might be viewed as stealing, albeit in a minor way. However, the argument about reducing waste is valid. Still, the method matters. Maybe they could ask the staff if leftovers can be donated or if it's allowed, rather than taking it directly.\n\nThe author's friends are concerned about being embarrassing. Publicly taking leftovers might make others uncomfortable. The author's response about personal choice is a bit dismissive of others' feelings. Even if it's their choice, being considerate of how others perceive it is important in maintaining relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't causing harm beyond possible social discomfort. But social situations often require balancing personal actions with others' comfort. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned in terms of waste reduction, are likely seen as inconsiderate and violating social norms. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
