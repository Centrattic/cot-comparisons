      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user says that when people at nearby tables leave, they eat the leftovers because otherwise, they'd go to waste. Their girlfriend and others with them get upset, calling it disgusting and embarrassing. The user argues it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the perspective of the people around them. If someone does this in a public place like a restaurant, it's probably seen as unsanitary or inappropriate. People might feel that touching others' food is a violation of personal space and hygiene. Even if the food is being thrown away, taking it without permission could be seen as theft or at least inconsiderate. \n\nThen there's the aspect of public perception. In many cultures, sharing or taking others' food without consent is frowned upon. The user might not see the harm, but others might find it rude. The girlfriend is upset, which is a personal relationship issue. The user's argument is about personal choice, but in this case, the action affects others (the people who left, the people around them, and their girlfriend). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the food is going to waste, the act of taking it without asking could be seen as wrong because it disregards others' property and autonomy. Restaurants have staff to handle leftovers, so maybe the user's action isn't necessary. Also, the social norm is to wait for the staff to clear the table. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that reducing waste is a good intention, but the method is problematic. The key here is whether the action is respectful. Taking someone else's leftovers without their permission is likely to be seen as insensitive, regardless of the intention. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is probably in the wrong because their actions, while well-intentioned, violate social norms and make others uncomfortable. The argument of personal choice doesn't hold when it directly affects others negatively.\n"
