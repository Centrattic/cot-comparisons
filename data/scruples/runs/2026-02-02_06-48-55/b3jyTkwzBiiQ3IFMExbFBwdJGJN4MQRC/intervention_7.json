The people in my company (especially my girlfriend) say I'm disgusting and embarrassing, and they usually get pretty mad at me. Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author's friends and girlfriend are upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Most people would find it odd or rude to take someone else's leftovers without permission, even if they're leaving. Restaurants have their own policies on leftovers, and some might even discard them for hygiene reasons. So by taking the food, the author could be violating those policies or causing issues for the restaurant.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respecting others' property. Even if the food is left behind, it's technically someone else's property. Taking it without asking could be seen as disrespectful or intrusive. The girlfriend and friends feeling embarrassed makes sense because it's a public setting and their actions are visible to others.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but public behavior often involves social etiquette. What's acceptable in private might not be in public. The author's actions might make others uncomfortable, which is why their companions are upset. The argument about reducing waste is valid, but there are other ways to handle that, like asking the restaurant if they can donate leftovers or if the food can be taken if left behind. \n\nAlso, the author's insistence on controlling their own behavior might be seen as dismissive of others' feelings. Being considerate in social settings is usually expected. So while the intention to avoid waste is good, the method is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
