      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author's girlfriend and friends are upset, but they argue it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Taking someone else's leftovers without permission is generally considered inappropriate or even rude. Even if the food is left behind, it's still someone else's property. The act of taking it could be seen as violating their privacy and boundaries. Plus, while the author might think they're being resourceful, it can make others uncomfortable, especially if they're still served with the same food later. \n\nThe author's justification is that the food would be thrown away. However, restaurants have protocols for leftover food, like donating it or disposing of it properly. The author shouldn't assume their action is the only way to prevent waste. Also, the backlash from their partner and friends indicates that this behavior is frowned upon socially. \n\nThe argument about personal choice and others not controlling their behavior is a bit of a stretch. While people have the right to make their own choices, those choices should respect others' feelings and societal norms. The issue here is the lack of consent. Even if the people left the table, they might not have intended for others to take their food. So the author is overstepping by taking it without asking. \n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the key factors are consent and social etiquette. Since the author isn't getting permission and is causing discomfort to those around them, they are likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
