      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author's friends, especially their girlfriend, are upset and say it's disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends their actions by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. Eating someone else's leftovers in a public place like a restaurant might be seen as intrusive or violating personal space. Even though the people left, taking their leftovers could be considered an invasion of privacy or respect for others. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's not about stealing since the food isn't paid for by the author. However, it's more about consent and respect. The people who left might not want their leftovers taken, even if they're not there. It's similar to taking something someone else left behind without their permission. \n\nThe author's argument is about choice and autonomy. But actions in public spaces can affect others around you. The girlfriend's reaction is about being embarrassed, which is a social concern. The author's behavior might make others uncomfortable, which could be seen as insensitive even if the author isn't directly harming anyone.\n\nLegally, the food might still belong to the restaurant until it's disposed of, but that's probably not the main issue here. The main issue is social etiquette. Most people would find it odd or off-putting to see someone eating another table's leftovers. \n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions are disrespectful to others and cause discomfort. It's about considering others' feelings and social norms, not just personal choice.\n"
