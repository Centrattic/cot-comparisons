      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's action is taking food from other people's tables once those people have left. The argument is that the leftovers would go to waste, so they're being reused. However, the author's partner and others find this behavior disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, taking someone else's property without permission is generally considered wrong. Even if the food is left behind, the original owners might have intended to take it with them, or they might have left it by accident. Restaurants often have policies about this; sometimes they might save leftovers for a fee, but taking them without asking could be against the establishment's rules. \n\nThere's also the aspect of social norms. People might find it creepy or inappropriate to take another's food, even if it's leftovers. The author's justification is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But respecting others' property and privacy is a common social expectation. By taking the food, the author might be disregarding those norms, leading to embarrassment and conflict in their relationships.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that this behavior is causing significant issues. The author's insistence on their own choice might be seen as dismissive of others' feelings. Even if the action isn't illegal, it's likely socially unacceptable, making the author at fault. \n\nSo the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because they're taking others' property without permission, violating social norms, and causing distress to their companions.\n"
