      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables in restaurants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author says they do this because the leftovers would otherwise go to waste. That sounds like a practical reason. But their girlfriend and others with them are upset, finding it disgusting and embarrassing. The author is also defending their choice as their personal choice and resisting being controlled by others.\n\nNow, thinking about restaurant policies and expectations. When you order food at a restaurant, it's typically considered the customer's property once served. If the other diners leave, their food is still their property. Taking it without permission could be seen as theft, even though they're leaving. Restaurants might have their own policies about leftover food; some might donate it, others might discard it. But taking it directly from the table without asking would likely be against their policies.\n\nThen there's social etiquette. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without the previous customers' consent might be considered rude. People might leave food for various reasons\u2014maybe they're done, maybe they're waiting for the bill, or maybe they just don't want others to touch it. The author is making an assumption that it's okay to take it, which might not be shared by others. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that in social settings, people have different standards of appropriateness.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude of saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. While personal choice is important, in public settings, actions that affect others or are considered inconsiderate can be a point of contention. The author's behavior could be seen as respecting waste reduction but disregarding others' comfort and the restaurant's rules.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is taking someone else's property without permission, which is a violation of restaurant policies and social norms. Even if the intent is to reduce waste, there are other ways to do so, like asking the restaurant to donate the food or not taking it. The author's actions are likely inconsiderate and possibly against the establishment's rules, making them the one in the wrong.\n"
