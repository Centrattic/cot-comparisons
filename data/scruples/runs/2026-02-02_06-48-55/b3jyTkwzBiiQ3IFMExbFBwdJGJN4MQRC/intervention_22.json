      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author justifies it by saying the food would go to waste, but their girlfriend and friends are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and etiquette. In most cultures, taking food that others have ordered for themselves is considered inappropriate. Even if the food is left behind, it's still someone else's property. Restaurants might have policies against this, and staff might not appreciate customers doing that either. There's also the aspect of hygiene\u2014eating from others' plates could be seen as unsanitary.\n\nThe author's reasoning about food waste is valid, but there are other ways to address that. For example, restaurants often donate leftover food to shelters or compost it if they're environmentally conscious. The author could suggest that to their partner instead of taking it themselves.\n\nThe girlfriend and friends feeling embarrassed makes sense because this behavior is public and might make others uncomfortable. The author's response to dismiss their feelings by saying it's their choice and they shouldn't control them is dismissive. It's important to respect others' comfort levels, especially in a relationship where mutual respect is key.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the action is inconsiderate and against social norms, the justification doesn't hold up because there are better ways to handle food waste, and the author's dismissive attitude towards their partner's feelings is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
