Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author says they do this because otherwise the food would go to waste. Their girlfriend and others are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing, and the author is defending their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. In many cultures, eating someone else's leftovers, even if they're left behind, is considered inappropriate. It's not just about waste; it's about respecting others' belongings. Even if the table is empty, the food was ordered by someone else, and taking it might be seen as stealing, even if unintentional.\n\nThen there's the aspect of public behavior. The author's actions might make others uncomfortable. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that it's causing conflict in their relationship. The author's response, saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them, might be dismissing others' feelings and the social etiquette involved.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while reducing waste is commendable, the method here is questionable. Restaurants might have their own policies on leftover food, and employees might handle it. Taking it directly from the table could breach those policies or the restaurant's rules.\n\nSo, even if the intention is good, the action might not be socially acceptable or respectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're disregarding social norms and others' discomfort, even if their intent is to prevent waste.\n"
