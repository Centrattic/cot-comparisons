Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author eats leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants, and their girlfriend and friends are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Generally, when someone orders food, it's considered their property, even if they're not eating it anymore. Taking leftovers from another table without their permission is usually seen as inappropriate. It's not just about food waste; it's about respecting others' belongings and personal space. Even if the food would be thrown away, taking it without asking could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior. But in social settings, we often have to consider others' feelings and societal norms. Just because someone has the choice to do something doesn't mean it's acceptable. The girlfriend and friends finding it disgusting and embarrassing suggests that the author's actions are violating social boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author's response to their criticism by claiming it's their choice might come off as dismissive. It's important to acknowledge others' discomfort rather than insisting on personal freedom without regard for social norms. Even if the author has good intentions (like reducing waste), the method of doing so by taking from others without permission is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, disregard others' property and feelings, and the social norms in public dining spaces.\n"
