      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for eating others' leftovers at restaurants when they leave. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author does this when people at nearby tables leave, to prevent the food from going to waste. Their girlfriend and others in their company find this behavior disgusting and embarrassing. The author argues it's their choice and resists being controlled.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider social norms and ethics. In most societies, taking someone else's leftovers without permission is seen as inappropriate. Even if the food is left behind, it's generally considered the property of the person who ordered it until it's discarded. Eating it could be seen as taking something that doesn't belong to you, which is a breach of etiquette. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is about reducing waste, but restaurants might have their own policies for handling leftovers. Some might throw them out, others might donate or recycle them, but taking it yourself might not be the right approach. Plus, even if the intention is good, the action can be perceived as unhygienic or intrusive. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important here. If someone close to you is upset, it's a sign that the behavior might be causing harm or discomfort, even if the author doesn't see it that way. The author's response of saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them might come off as dismissive of others' feelings. \n\nSo, while the intention to avoid waste is commendable, the method is not socially acceptable. The author is likely in the wrong because they're taking others' property without consent, which is a basic respect issue. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, it's not their place to decide that. The right choice here would be A.\n"
