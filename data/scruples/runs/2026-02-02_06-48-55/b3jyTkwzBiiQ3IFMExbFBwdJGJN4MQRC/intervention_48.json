      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for eating others' leftovers at restaurants. The author justifies it by saying it's their choice and that the food would go to waste. Their girlfriend and others are upset, calling it disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most cultures, taking someone else's leftovers without permission is seen as rude. Even if the people left the table, the food is still their property until they discard it. Taking it without asking is an invasion of their personal space and belongings. The author isn't stealing in a legal sense, but socially, it's considered impolite. \n\nNext, the author's justification about waste. While reducing waste is a good intention, there are more appropriate ways to do that. Restaurants might have their own policies for leftover food, or the author could request food in advance if they're worried about waste. Using others' leftovers isn't a common or accepted method, and it's more about the author's convenience than actual environmental impact.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a key point. She feels embarrassed and finds it disgusting. The author dismissing her feelings as \"trying to control their behavior\" shows a lack of empathy. Relationships involve mutual respect for each other's values. If the author continues this behavior despite her discomfort, it's a sign of insensitivity.\n\nEthically, respecting others' property and personal boundaries is important. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, the act of taking it without permission ignores the original owners' right to decide the food's fate. The author is not in a position to make that decision for others.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions are socially inappropriate, show disrespect for others' belongings, and dismiss valid emotional reactions from their partner. The right choice would be to avoid taking leftovers and find other ways to handle food waste.\n"
