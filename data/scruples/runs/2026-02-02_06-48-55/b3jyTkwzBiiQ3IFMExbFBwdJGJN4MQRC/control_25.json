      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The writer's reasoning is that the food would otherwise go to waste, but their girlfriend and companions are upset, calling it disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and etiquette around this. In most cultures, people expect that their food is for their own consumption, and taking from others without permission can be seen as intrusive or unhygienic. Even if the food is left behind, the act of taking it might be perceived as stealing, especially if the other party hasn't given it up. Restaurants might have their own policies about this, but the question is more about social appropriateness than legality.\n\nThe writer's defense is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But in social settings, personal choices often have to respect others' comfort and boundaries. If others find it unacceptable, the writer's right to choose is balanced against the impact on their companions. The girlfriend's reaction suggests it's causing conflict, so the writer might be disregarding others' feelings by insisting on their choice.\n\nAnother angle: waste is a concern, but there might be better ways to address it, like asking the staff if they can take leftovers or donate them. Snatching them from another table without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, health and safety issues if the food isn't properly handled once left out.\n\nSo, even though the intention to avoid waste is understandable, the method is likely causing more harm in terms of social discomfort and relationships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
