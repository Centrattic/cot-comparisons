Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for eating others' leftovers at restaurants. The author justifies it by saying the food would go to waste, but their girlfriend and friends get upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, taking someone else's leftovers without their permission is considered rude or inconsiderate. People might feel that even if the food is being thrown away, it's not the author's place to take it. There's also the aspect of personal boundaries and respecting others' property, even if it's not explicitly claimed. \n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but others might see it as a lack of consideration for hygiene or the original owners' preferences. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this behavior is causing conflict in their relationship. So, even if the intention is to reduce waste, the method might be frowned upon. \n\nLegally, the food belongs to the restaurant until it's paid for, but once the bill is settled, maybe the diners have some claim. However, taking it without asking is still likely against restaurant policies. There's also the possibility of health and safety issues if the food has been sitting out too long. \n\nSo, balancing the intention to prevent waste against social etiquette and the reactions of others, it seems the author is overstepping. The answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the action is rude and disrespectful, even if the intent is good. The author's defense about personal choice doesn't override the negative impact on others and social norms.\n"
