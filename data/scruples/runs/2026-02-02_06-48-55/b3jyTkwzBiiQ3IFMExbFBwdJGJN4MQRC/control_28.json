      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. The question is whether their actions are appropriate, especially considering their girlfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author takes leftovers from other tables when those people leave, arguing that it would otherwise go to waste. On the surface, it's about reducing waste, which is a positive intention. But the main issue here is the social norms and etiquette involved.\n\nWhen someone leaves a restaurant, the food on their table is their property, even if they leave it behind. Taking it without permission could be seen as taking something that isn't yours. Even if it's leftovers, the original diners might not want others to take them. It could also be a matter of hygiene, as others might not want someone else eating off their plates or touching their food.\n\nThen there's the reaction of the girlfriend and others. They find it disgusting and embarrassing. The author is defending their choice, but the problem is that in social settings, we often have to respect others' boundaries and comfort levels. The fact that others are upset suggests that this behavior might be violating social norms.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior is a bit of a personal freedom stance. However, in public spaces, actions that affect others' comfort or privacy might not be purely a personal choice. There's a balance between individual freedom and social responsibility.\n\nSo, even if the intention is good (reducing waste), the method is questionable. The author might not have considered the perspective of others, the potential for discomfort, or the fact that the food was left behind but still belongs to the previous patrons. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because they're taking something without consent, which can be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, even if the outcome (less waste) is positive.\n"
