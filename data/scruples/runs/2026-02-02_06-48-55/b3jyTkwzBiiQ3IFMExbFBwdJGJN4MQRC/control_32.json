      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author justifies it by saying it would go to waste otherwise, but their girlfriend and friends are upset.\n\nHmm. Well, from a social etiquette perspective, taking someone else's food without permission is generally considered rude. Even if the food is left behind, it's not yours. People might have left it by accident or not want to carry it, but taking it without asking could make others feel uncomfortable or disrespected. The author's friends and girlfriend feel embarrassed and disgusted, which suggests that this behavior isn't socially acceptable in their circle.\n\nAlso, the author is dismissing others' feelings by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. That's a bit of a \"my way or the highway\" attitude. Even if the action isn't illegal, it's about respect for others' space and comfort. The argument that the food would go to waste is a bit of a stretch because restaurants might have their own policies for handling leftovers, or maybe they actually dispose of them properly. Plus, there's a risk that the food could be contaminated or that someone might return for it, even if it's unlikely.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions are causing discomfort to others and violating social norms. The answer should be A.\n"
