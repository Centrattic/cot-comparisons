      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. The author justifies it by saying the food would go to waste otherwise. Their partner and friends are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing. The author then argues it's their choice and resists being controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Generally, taking someone else's leftovers without permission is seen as rude. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, it's not yours to take. People might have left items like condiments, utensils, or specific dishes that others might not want disturbed. There's a privacy aspect here too\u2014others might not want their table space invaded, even if they've left.\n\nThen there's the perspective of the people around them. The girlfriend and others are clearly upset. The author's argument that it's their choice might be seen as dismissive of others' feelings. Even if the author isn't trying to harm, the action is disruptive and inconsiderate. The justification of reducing waste is noble, but the method might not be appropriate. Restaurants might have policies about this, or maybe the staff handles leftovers. \n\nAnother angle: respect for others' property and space. Even if the table is abandoned, the food was paid for by others. Taking it without asking could be seen as theft, depending on local laws. But more socially, it's about respect. People might feel uncomfortable or invaded if someone takes from their table, even after they leave. The author's behavior could make others in the restaurant feel uneasy, affecting the overall atmosphere.\n\nThe author's insistence that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them might come off as selfish. Social interactions often require compromise and consideration. Even if the action isn't illegal, it's about how others perceive and feel about it. So, the author is likely in the wrong because they're disregarding others' comfort and social norms, even with good intentions.\n"
