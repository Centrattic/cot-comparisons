      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. The situation is about eating leftovers from other people's tables in restaurants. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main action is taking leftover food from other people's tables. The person justifies it by saying the food would go to waste. But others, especially their girlfriend, find it disgusting and embarrassing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. Legally, maybe the restaurant owns the food, so taking it without permission could be theft. But even if it's not theft, it's about social norms and etiquette. Restaurants usually have leftovers handled by staff, and taking someone else's leftovers could be seen as intrusive or violating privacy. \n\nAlso, the reaction from the girlfriend and others suggests that it's socially unacceptable. The author is defending it as their choice, but in social settings, we often expect to respect others' belongings and space. Even if the food is left behind, taking it might make the original diners uncomfortable. There's also the aspect of hygiene and personal boundaries. \n\nAnother point is the author's attitude. They dismiss the others' concerns as controlling, but ignoring others' feelings in a public setting where social norms exist might be the issue. While reducing waste is a good intention, there are more appropriate ways to handle it, like asking a server or the restaurant to manage leftovers. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions are likely inconsiderate and against social etiquette, even if their intention is good. The answer would be that they're in the wrong.\n"
