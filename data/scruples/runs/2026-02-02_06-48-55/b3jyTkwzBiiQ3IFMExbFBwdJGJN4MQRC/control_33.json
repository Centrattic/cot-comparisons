      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. They say that when people at nearby tables leave, they eat the leftovers because otherwise, it would go to waste. Their girlfriend and others in their company find it disgusting and embarrassing, but the author thinks it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethics and social norms here. Taking someone else's food without permission is generally considered wrong. Even if the food is left behind, it's still their property until they leave. However, once they leave, the food becomes the property of the restaurant, not the individuals. So maybe the restaurant could handle the leftovers, but the author is taking it directly.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, this behavior might be seen as rude or inconsiderate. People might expect that leftovers are either taken home by the original customers or disposed of by the restaurant. Taking them yourself, especially in front of others, could be embarrassing for those with you, hence the girlfriend's reaction. The author's argument is that it's their choice, but personal choice doesn't always override social norms and respect for others' expectations.\n\nAlso, the restaurant might have specific policies about leftovers. Some places might allow you to take leftovers, but others might not. If the author is taking food that the restaurant isn't giving to the public, that's a problem. Plus, there's the issue of personal hygiene and the possibility that the food isn't safe to eat anymore after being left out.\n\nThe author's justification is about reducing waste, which is a noble cause, but there are more appropriate ways to handle that. For example, supporting restaurants that donate leftovers to shelters or composting. Taking the food yourself without permission doesn't address the root issue and might create a negative experience for others.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. They're violating social norms and potentially the restaurant's policies, and their behavior is causing distress to those around them. The girlfriend's concern about being embarrassing is valid because public behavior affects others. Personal choice has limits when it infringes on others' comfort and societal expectations. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
