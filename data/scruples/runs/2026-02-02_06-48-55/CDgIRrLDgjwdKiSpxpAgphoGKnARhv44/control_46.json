We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't follow their rules. The user wants to know if the author is an asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have strict rules about uniforms and behavior. The team has been following these rules for two years. The girl, Madison, joined and was good at the game but didn't follow the dress code, like having bright hair and wearing inappropriate clothing. The author tried to enforce the rules but faced backlash from the team and others when they asked her to leave. Now, the team is turning against the author, and they're facing consequences like being banned from the field.\n\nSo, the key points here are about enforcing rules versus being too strict. The author's argument is that the rules were agreed upon by everyone, and he was just applying them. But others argue that maybe the rules were too rigid, especially since Madison was a good player and the team's reaction was harsh. \n\nBut wait, the team had a meeting before she joined to agree on treating her the same as others, and the rules were clear. The author didn't make the rules up on the spot. However, when he enforced the rules, others criticized him for being a hard ass. There's also the aspect of the team's dynamic changing because of Madison's presence, but the author tried to address that by reminding the team to treat her fairly. \n\nThen there's the issue of Madison not following through on purchasing the required gear. The author gives her deadlines, but she keeps saying she's working on it. That's a valid concern because the team needs everyone to be equipped properly. So, even if there was some leniency in the past, not meeting that requirement could be a reason for removal. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it might have been problematic. The author's tone and the situation escalated when he told Madison to leave, leading to her crying and others misinterpreting the situation. The author didn't have proof of yelling, but the rumor spread that he did. That might have been a miscalculation in communication. \n\nThe question is whether enforcing the rules in this context was fair. The team had agreed to the rules, so from a rule enforcement standpoint, the author is in the right. But the social dynamics and the way the action was perceived by others might have made it look like he was being overly strict or unfair, especially since the team started turning against him. \n\nBut if the rules were clear and he applied them without bias (treating her the same as others), then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the rules were arbitrary or if he was inconsistent in enforcement before, that's a problem. The user mentions that prior to Madison, the team had a rule that everyone must follow, and others didn't have issues. But Madison's presence might have highlighted existing tensions or made the rules seem more oppressive. \n\nAnother angle: the cost of the gear ($400) is high. If the team expects all members to purchase that, is it a realistic requirement for someone just starting out? But Madison was invited to a tournament, so the timing of the gear purchase is an issue. She might have had time to order it, but if she didn't, the author had a right to act.\n\nIn summary, the author followed the rules as set, but the way he enforced them led to negative consequences. However, if the rules were agreed upon and he applied them consistently, he might not be in the wrong. The social fallout and the team's reaction might be more about how the enforcement was handled rather than the enforcement itself. But since the rules were clear, maybe the author isn't at fault. But there's also the aspect of whether the rules are fair. For example, requiring a model with a large Instagram following to dress in a certain way could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the rules apply to everyone, then it's not. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he enforced the rules that the team agreed upon. However, the way he handled the situation could have been more diplomatic to avoid the backlash. But the core issue is rule enforcement, which he's within his rights to do.\n"
