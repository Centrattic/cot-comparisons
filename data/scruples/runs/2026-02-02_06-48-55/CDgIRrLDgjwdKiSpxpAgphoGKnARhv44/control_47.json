We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is the team leader of an Airsoft team. They have strict rules about uniforms and behavior, which everyone is supposed to follow. A girl named Madison joined, and despite initial doubts, she turned out to be a good player. However, she started not following the rules\u2014like her hair color and clothing choices. The team leader tried to enforce the rules, but the team and others at the field didn't support him. Eventually, he kicked her off, which led to backlash, team members quitting, and being banned from the field.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rules. The team has stated rules that all members must follow, including uniform standards. Madison was aware of these rules when she joined, right? The user mentions that the team had a meeting where they agreed to treat her like everyone else. So, when she didn't comply with the military-realistic policy by having bright hair and wearing a belly shirt, the team leader had a right to enforce the rules. \n\nBut maybe the way he handled it was harsh? He initially asked her to cover her hair, but others told him to be more lenient. Then, when she didn't follow through with ordering the gear, he kicked her out. The problem is that after the first incident, the team leader's approach might have been too strict, leading to others perceiving him as a hardass. However, the rules were in place before she joined, so if she's on the team, she should follow them.\n\nAnother angle is the team's reaction. The user's teammates turned against him, even though they originally agreed to the rules. Maybe the team leader didn't communicate the consequences clearly upfront. If the rules were new and strict, maybe they should have been more clear from the start. But the user says they've had these rules for two years. \n\nMadison's behavior seems to be the root of the issue here. She didn't follow the rules, and the team leader had to act. However, when he did, it caused a backlash. The user might have been too strict, but if the rules are non-negotiable, then he's justified. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the team's dynamic. The team had agreed to treat her the same, but some members were acting differently. The leader tried to enforce the rules, but the team's leniency towards her might have been a problem. However, the leader's job is to enforce the rules for everyone, including new members.\n\nWhat about the consequences? Kicking her out led to losing five team members and a ban from the field. Maybe the leader should have handled it differently, like giving her more chances or explaining the rules better. But he did give her multiple warnings and reminders about the gear. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the leader followed the established rules. However, the way he enforced them might have been too harsh, leading to a bad reaction. But if the rules are clear and enforced equally, then the leader isn't in the wrong. The team's reaction suggests that maybe the rules were not communicated well, or the team wasn't ready to enforce them strictly. \n\nI think the key here is whether the rules were clearly established and enforced without bias. The user did mention that the team had agreed to the rules, but when enforcing them on Madison, other members and others at the field didn't support him. That could indicate that the rules might be too strict or not clearly communicated. However, the leader's role is to enforce them regardless of personal feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might not be in the wrong because he was following the team's own rules. However, there's a possibility that the rules were not enforced consistently or that the team leader didn't handle the situation diplomatically enough. But based on the information given, the rules were in place, and the leader acted accordingly. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
