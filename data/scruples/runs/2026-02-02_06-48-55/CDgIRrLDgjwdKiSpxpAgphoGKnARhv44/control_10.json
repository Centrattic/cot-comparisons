We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't follow the rules. The rules are about military realism, like no bright colors, anime stuff, fake swords, etc. The team also requires $400 worth of uniform gear to maintain a professional look.\n\nFirst, the girl Madison joined and was good at Airsoft, which the author acknowledges. But then she came with bright red hair, which the author made her cover up. She found it uncomfortable and took it off during a game. The author called her out, but the team members were upset with him. Then, she didn't order the uniform gear, even after being reminded. The author tried to talk to her again, and she wore a belly shirt and showed welts from being shot, which the team members noticed and her popularity increased. The author then decided to remove her from the team, leading to backlash from the team and other people at the field.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The team has established rules that everyone is supposed to follow. The author is the leader and is responsible for enforcing them. However, the team members agreed to treat her the same as others, but when the author enforced the rules, they reacted negatively. The author argues that he was just following the rules, but the team's reaction suggests that maybe they didn't expect the rules to be applied so strictly, especially to a woman who was receiving a lot of attention.\n\nPossible issues here: Was the rule about hair color and clothing applied fairly? The story mentions that the team had a meeting before her arrival to agree to treat her the same, but when the author tried to enforce the rules, others said he was being too harsh. Maybe the rules weren't clearly communicated or consistently enforced before. Also, the author's initial assumption about her joining the team might have influenced his strictness. The fact that other teams and strays suggested he should chill might indicate that the rules are more about team culture than strict necessity, and that there's an expectation of some flexibility when a new member, especially a woman in a male-dominated sport, comes on board.\n\nAdditionally, the author's response to her not buying the gear could be seen as harsh. He waited until she had issues with multiple rules before removing her, but the way he handled it might have exacerbated the situation. The team's reaction\u2014quitting and forming a new team\u2014suggests that the author's enforcement style is causing internal conflict, even if the rules are valid. Maybe the author didn't consider the social dynamics at play. Enforcing rules is important, but handling it in a way that's respectful and addresses the underlying issues (like team spirit and inclusion) might have been necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to maintain the team's standards and cohesion. If the rules are part of the team's identity and the girl's non-compliance is causing distractions (like other players being more attentive to her), then there's a point to enforcing them. However, the sudden backlash from the team and the field owner might indicate that the author's approach was too rigid or that there's a perception of double standards. The field owner took action based on a rumor, which the author might not be responsible for, but the team's reaction could stem from feeling that the author is being overly strict or maybe even misogynistic. The fact that the team had a meeting to not date her but allowed her to have special treatment in other ways might show inconsistency. Also, the author's initial assumption about her motives (thinking she was just looking for followers) could have affected his judgment, making others feel he was biased.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the rules, but the way he handled the situation could be problematic. The rules were agreed upon, but if they weren't consistently enforced before or if there's a perception of unfair enforcement, that's where the issue lies. Also, the social dynamics in a male-dominated sport with a new female member could have influenced how the author's actions were perceived. The key is whether the author applied the rules fairly and whether the team's reaction is justified based on that. Since the rules are a core part of the team and the author was enforcing them, but the team and others saw it as harsh or discriminatory, it's a mixed case. However, the main point is that the author was following established rules, so the answer would be B (No), but there's nuance in the approach.\n"
