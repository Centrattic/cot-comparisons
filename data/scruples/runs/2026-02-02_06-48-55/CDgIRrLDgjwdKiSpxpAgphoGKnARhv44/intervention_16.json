We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (me, in this scenario) is in the wrong for kicking a girl off the Airsoft team because she didn't follow the rules. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the team has strict rules about uniforms and appearance to maintain a military-realistic look. The author is the team leader, and the team has to follow these rules for competitions. Then there's Madison, who joined the team. She was a model with a lot of followers, which surprised the author. Initially, the team agreed to treat her the same as others, but there was some tension because of her looks. \n\nThe first issue was her bright red hair with ponytails. The author told her to cover it with a beanie under her helmet because of the rules. She took it off during a game, and the author called her out. The team and others at the field thought the author was being too strict. Later, she didn't get her uniform gear ordered as required, and she kept saying she was working on it. Then she wore a belly shirt and showed welts from getting shot, which the author found against the military-realistic rules. He then told her she wasn't a good fit, leading to her crying and others turning against him.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze. The rules were set before she joined, and she agreed to them. If she didn't follow them, the author had to enforce the rules. However, there might be nuances. Did the author communicate the rules clearly? The author mentions that the team had a meeting before she arrived to treat her as others. So, he did set expectations. But when she didn't comply, he enforced the rules. \n\nHowever, the way he handled the situation might have contributed to the backlash. The team and others at the field thought he was being too harsh. The author's comment about her being a \"hot girl\" and the team's dynamic might have influenced perceptions. Also, the incident where she cried and the rumor that he yelled at her could have made him look like an asshole, even if he followed the rules. The airsoft field owner iced him due to a rumor, which is unfortunate, but maybe the author could have handled the confrontation more carefully.\n\nOn the other hand, the rules were agreed upon, and if a team member doesn't follow them, the leader must act. The author's actions were within his role as team leader. But maybe the enforcement was too strict or the communication was lacking. The key points are: 1) Were the rules clear? 2) Was the enforcement fair and consistent? 3) Did the author act within his authority?\n\nThe rules were in place for two years, so they weren't arbitrary. The author did enforce them against her, which is fair. However, the team and others' reactions suggest that the enforcement might have been seen as harsh, possibly because of the social dynamics (her being a model, the team's reaction to her). The author might have been strict, but if the rules are non-negotiable for a competitive team, then kicking her out for not following them isn't necessarily wrong. However, the manner in which he did it, leading to her emotional reaction and the subsequent fallout, might indicate that the author didn't handle the situation well, even if the action was justified.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the rules, but the way he did it could have been a problem. The question is whether the rules were clear and fairly applied. Since the team had agreed to the rules, and the author followed through, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the enforcement was unreasonable or the rules were too strict given the circumstances, then A (in the wrong). Considering the context, the rules were set, and the author followed through, so B might be correct. However, the social dynamics and the backlash suggest that the author might have made a mistake in handling the situation.\n"
