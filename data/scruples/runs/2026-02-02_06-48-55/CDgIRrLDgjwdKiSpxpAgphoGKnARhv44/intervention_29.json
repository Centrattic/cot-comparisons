We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Airsoft team situation is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author is a team leader who set strict rules for uniform and behavior. The main conflict arises with Madison, a new female team member. The author enforced the rules when she didn't comply with hair and clothing policies, leading to her removal from the team. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nLooking at the details: The team had established rules, which Madison didn't follow. The author tried to enforce them, but others on the team and even other players supported Madison, leading to the author's punishment and team members quitting. \n\nKey points to consider: \n1. Were the rules communicated clearly to Madison beforehand? The author mentions they reiterated the rules, but maybe there was ambiguity or inconsistency in enforcement. \n2. The author's personal judgment of Madison (thinking she was a model playing for attention) might have influenced his strictness. Did this bias affect his decision-making? \n3. The reaction of the team and others might be due to the social dynamics of having a female in a male-dominated sport, possibly leading to a double standard. \n4. The author's approach in handling the situation (e.g., being abrupt, leading to Madison crying) could be seen as harsh, even if the rules were there. \n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong (A): \n- The rules might be inflexible, especially if they were created without considering practical needs (e.g., comfort in hot weather). \n- The author's personal bias might have made him too strict, especially if he noticed others being friendlier to Madison. \n- The way the author handled the confrontation (removing her without a clear process) could have been insensitive, given the social dynamics and her being a minority in a male-dominated group. \n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong (B): \n- The team had clear rules, and the author enforced them consistently. \n- The team's rules are part of their identity and professionalism, so compliance is necessary for tournaments. \n- The author was trying to maintain team unity and standards, which is a leader's role. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the team's reaction. If the team is now turning on the author because they felt he was too harsh, maybe the rules were too rigid, or the author didn't adapt to the situation (like allowing exceptions for practical reasons). Also, the fact that others didn't support the rule enforcement suggests the rules might be inconsistently applied or not well-liked. \n\nThe author's initial assumption about Madison might have led to a more rigid enforcement of rules, which could have been perceived as unfair, especially if other team members were more lenient. The key issue is whether the rules were applied fairly and if the author considered the context (e.g., heat for the belly shirt). \n\nSo, considering all this, it's possible that the author was not entirely in the wrong, but his approach might have been too rigid and possibly influenced by bias, leading to a breakdown in team morale. However, the main issue is whether the rules were enforceable as written. If the rules were clear and he applied them without malice, he might not be in the wrong. But the negative consequences and the team's reaction suggest that the approach had flaws. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he was enforcing the rules as they existed. However, the way he handled the situation could have been better, but the core of the issue is rule enforcement.\n"
