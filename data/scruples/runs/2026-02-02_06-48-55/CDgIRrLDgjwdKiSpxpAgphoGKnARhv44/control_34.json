We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't follow their rules. The user wants to know if the author is an asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the rules of the team. The team has strict military-realistic policies, and there's a $400 uniform requirement for the competition team. The girl, Madison, joined and initially did well, but then violated some rules like not covering her hair properly and wearing inappropriate clothing. The author enforced the rules, leading to conflict and eventually her being kicked out. The team turned on the author, with some quitting and others wanting to remove him as leader.\n\nIs the author wrong for enforcing the rules he set? Well, he created the rules, and the team agreed to them. If members don't follow the rules, he has a right to enforce them. However, there's a nuance here. The team's rules include strict appearance standards, but maybe there's some inconsistency. For instance, the author mentions that the team had a meeting to treat her the same as others, but others might have been giving her special treatment. The author tried to enforce the rules when others weren't, which could be seen as fair or unfair depending on perspective.\n\nThen there's the context of Madison's situation. She's a model and influencer, which might have caused jealousy or bias among the team. The author was initially skeptical of her, thinking she was using the team for Instagram likes. But she proved herself as a good player. However, her non-compliance with appearance rules led to the conflict. The author's strictness might be justified if the rules are non-negotiable for the team's cohesion and professionalism, especially for competitions.\n\nBut maybe the author overreacted. When Madison first didn't cover her hair, the team told him he was being too hard. Then later, when she wore a belly shirt, he kicked her out. The team's reaction suggests that they might have felt he was being inconsistent or too harsh, especially since others weren't enforces the rules on others. The fact that other teams and strangers at the field advised him to \"chill out\" might indicate that his enforcement was too strict in their eyes.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the team turned against him, he got banned from the field due to a rumor, and several members quit. This could imply that his approach was too rigid or that he didn't handle the situation diplomatically. Maybe he could have had a more private conversation with Madison, offered more flexibility, or found a middle ground instead of immediate expulsion. The fact that she was crying and got immediate support from others might have been because the enforcement felt unfair to others, even if the rules were technically there.\n\nAnother angle: the team rules were set two years prior, and the team agreed to them. So as a leader, he's within his rights to enforce them. However, if the rules are not consistently applied, that's a problem. But in the case, when Madison first violated the hair rule, the team told him he was being too harsh. That might suggest that the rules weren't consistently enforced before. If the team is now turning on him for enforcing rules they previously agreed to, but others weren't following, maybe the issue lies in their inconsistency rather than the author's actions.\n\nAlso, Madison might have felt that the rules were arbitrary or that the author was targeting her. If other team members were given leeway (like bending over backwards to be friendlier to her), she might have felt she was being treated unfairly. The author tried to set a rule that everyone treat her the same, but if others weren't following it, it's possible that the rules were not being applied equally. So when the author tried to enforce it, it looked like he was singling her out, even if he was trying to be fair.\n\nSo the core issue is whether the author was enforcing the rules fairly and consistently. If the rules were not being applied equally before, then his enforcement might have been unfair. Additionally, the way he handled the situation\u2014publicly kicking her out during a game, leading to her crying and public backlash\u2014might have been a poor approach, even if the rules were technically there.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on enforcing rules that he and the team created, which is valid. However, if the enforcement was inconsistent or handled poorly, that could be where he went wrong. The team's reaction suggests that his approach might have been too harsh or that the rules were not consistently applied before, making the situation complicated. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B) because he was enforcing the rules, but the way he did it could be improved. However, given the team's reaction and the inconsistency in rule enforcement, maybe there's a case for him being in the wrong (A). Hmm, this is tricky.\n"
