We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't follow the uniform rules. The team has strict \"military-realistic\" policies, like no bright colors or anime stuff. The girl, Madison, became a good player but started not following the rules, first with her hair, then her clothing. The leader tried to enforce the rules, but the team and others thought he was being too harsh. Now, he's facing backlash, including some team members quitting and a ban from the field.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the team's rules. They require everyone to buy specific gear for uniformity and professionalism. If the team has these rules and they were agreed upon, then the leader is justified in enforcing them. But maybe the way he enforced them was a problem. For example, when she first came with red hair, he made her wear a beanie. She found it uncomfortable and took it off during a game. He called her out, but others told him to be more lenient. Perhaps the rules are too rigid, especially if they were made for a military theme but don't account for individual differences. \n\nThen there's the issue of the team's reaction. The author mentions that even his friends were friendlier to Madison, which might indicate that the team had a biased view towards her. Maybe the leader felt that allowing exceptions for her could disrupt team dynamics, but the way he handled it might have been too abrupt. The girl crying and the subsequent rumors could have been exacerbated by the leader's communication style. Did he approach the confrontation calmly, or was it a heated argument? If he was strict without considering her perspective, that might come off as harsh. \n\nAlso, the team's response: when he followed through on his rule enforcement, others accused him of being a hard ass. If the rules were important to the team's identity (military-realistic look), then not enforcing them could undermine the team's standards. But if the rules were not consistently applied before, or if the leader was too inflexible, that's a problem. The key here is whether the rules were clearly communicated and consistently enforced. If the leader had been strict with others before Madison joined, and only became lenient when she asked, that's hypocrisy. But if he enforced them equally, maybe the team was just uncomfortable with the idea of a girl not being exempt.\n\nAnother angle is the reason behind the rules. If the team's rules are meant to ensure a professional appearance for competitions, then compliance is necessary. However, if the rules are more about enforcing a certain image (like avoiding \"girly\" things) which might be based on stereotypes or discrimination, that's a different issue. The fact that Madison is a model with 100k followers might have influenced the team's dynamics, possibly leading to unconscious bias where the leader felt she was a distraction and wanted to maintain a male-dominated environment. But that would be problematic if the rules are being used to exclude someone based on gender or appearance. \n\nThe timeline of events is also important. The team had these rules for two years, but after Madison's hair incident, the leader faced immediate backlash. It's possible that the team was okay with the rules when they were applied to other members but didn't want to see them applied to a girl, fearing they might seem inhospitable or discriminatory. The leader might have been right in enforcing the rules, but the negative reaction from the team suggests that maybe the rules were not well-received or were seen as overly strict, especially in the context of a female player who was performing well but not fitting the aesthetic. \n\nThe final decision to kick her out after she didn't follow the uniform purchases\u2014was that done after multiple reminders? The author says he asked her again, and she kept saying \"I'm working on it.\" If the gear is required for all team members, then not having it would be a valid reason for removal. However, the fact that the team supported her and turned against the leader indicates that they might not have had the same priorities. Maybe the leader should have had a more gradual approach, like giving her more time or understanding if she was struggling with the costs, but the story says it's as easy as ordering online. \n\nIn terms of the leader's communication, was he clear and respectful when enforcing the rules? If he was abrupt or condescending, that could have contributed to the negative perception. The part where he says \"you have to leave\" and she cried immediately might have been handled better. Perhaps a private conversation where he explained the consequences of not following the rules, rather than a public confrontation, would have been more appropriate. \n\nSo, putting this all together: The author's actions were based on enforcing pre-existing team rules. However, the way he handled it, especially the public removal, might have been insensitive. The team's reaction suggests that they valued inclusivity and flexibility over strict adherence to the rules, especially in the case of a skilled female player. There's a possibility that the rules were not consistently applied before, or that the team was more lenient with other members, leading to a double standard. \n\nBut the author claims the rules were agreed upon by everyone, including his team, and that they were supposed to treat Madison the same as others. If the team had agreed to the rules and the leader was just applying them equally, then he might not be in the wrong. However, the team's behavior (bending over backwards to be friendlier, not supporting the leader's enforcement) shows that maybe the rules weren't as strict in practice when a female was involved. The leader could be right in enforcing the rules, but the social dynamics at play made it look like he was being harsh, especially with the crying and the rumors. \n\nAlso, the airsoft field owner banning him based on a rumor is a bit extreme, but that might be a consequence of the leader's approach. If the leader was known for being a hard ass, the team might have expected more leniency towards Madison, and his refusal to adjust led to the backlash. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the rules were consistently enforced and if the enforcement was respectful. If he applied the rules equally and communicated them clearly, then he's not in the wrong. But if the rules were flexible before or if his approach was too harsh or contributed to a toxic environment by focusing on appearance over performance, then maybe he is. The story suggests the rules were in place for two years, so there's a case for enforcement. However, the team's reaction and the context of a female player might indicate that the rules were more about maintaining a certain image that the team was uncomfortable challenging. So the author might be in the wrong for not adapting the rules to a new situation where a female's presence could challenge the existing norms, or he might be right if the rules were absolute and necessary for the team's identity. The question is whether the rules are genuinely about professionalism or if they're a cover for excluding someone based on appearance or gender.\n"
