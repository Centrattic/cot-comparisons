We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't follow their rules. The author's side of the story is that they had strict military-realistic rules and required gear, and the girl, Madison, didn't comply despite being told. The team leader felt they had to enforce the rules, but now the team is turning against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The team had established rules before Madison joined, and everyone was supposed to follow them. The leader mentions that the team discussed treating her the same as others. So, from that angle, if the rules were clear and communicated, then enforcing them shouldn't be a problem. However, there might be an issue with how the rules were enforced. The leader was strict on her hair, which might be seen as a double standard if other team members aren't required to cover their hair in the same way. For example, if other team members have different hairstyles but aren't made to cover them, then the rule might be applied inconsistently. That could be a point where the author is in the wrong because it shows favoritism or inconsistency in rule enforcement.\n\nThen there's the issue of the uniform gear. The author required proof that Madison ordered the gear, but she kept saying she was working on it. If the same expectation was applied to all team members, and she wasn't meeting that, then the leader had a right to remove her. But if the leader was more lenient with others in the past, that could be a problem. The fact that the team members were upset with the leader suggests that maybe the rules were applied unevenly. For instance, the team members said he was being a hard ass, which might indicate that he's usually strict but perhaps not with everyone in the same way. If Madison was being held to a higher standard than others, that's an issue.\n\nAnother point is the dynamic of having a female in a male-dominated sport. The leader mentions that the team had a meeting to ensure everyone treated her the same, but even his friends were friendlier to her. That could indicate that the environment was changing, and maybe the leader felt pressure from the team's reaction. However, the leader's main issue was with rule compliance, not the social dynamics. But if the team's reaction was more about the girl's presence rather than the actual rules, that might have influenced how the leader was perceived.\n\nThe outcome was that Madison cried and the team turned against the leader. The leader might have considered the rules and their enforcement, but the way he handled the confrontation could have been part of the problem. If he was abrupt or didn't consider the social dynamics, it might have exacerbated the situation. However, if the rules were clear and he followed the proper process, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the key here is whether the rules were applied fairly. If the leader had exceptions for others, then he's in the wrong. If he applied the same rules to everyone, then he's not. The story mentions that when Madison arrived, the team had a meeting to treat her the same, but the leader's friends were still friendlier. That suggests that the team might have been inconsistent in their behavior towards her, but the leader's enforcement of the rules could still be justified if the rules were clear. However, the hair issue: was the rule about bright colors or specific to military realism? If the rule was against bright colors, then a red beanie might be against it. But if other team members have different colored hair or gear without being required to cover it, then the leader was being inconsistent. \n\nAlso, the uniform gear requirement: if others were given more time or leniency, but Madison wasn't, that's a problem. The leader might have been too strict with her without giving her the same chances given to others. \n\nThe leader also mentions that after the hair incident, he kept pushing her about the gear, and she kept saying she was working on it. If the deadline was clear and she missed it, then it's justified. But if there was flexibility in the past, maybe he should have given her more time. \n\nIn terms of the social dynamics, the leader might not be at fault for enforcing the rules, but the way he did it could have contributed to the backlash. If the team felt he was being too harsh or if the rules were applied unevenly, that's where he could be in the wrong. But if the rules were applied fairly, then he's in the right. \n\nI need to weigh the consistency in rule enforcement. If the rules were applied equally to all, then the leader is not in the wrong. But if he was stricter with Madison than others, then he is. The story doesn't clearly say if others had similar issues, but the team members complained about him being a hard ass after the hair incident. That suggests that maybe the team felt he was being too strict, but the rules were supposed to be enforced. \n\nAnother angle: the leader's initial reaction to Madison's looks. He thought she was just there for followers but was surprised she was good. That could have led to unconscious bias, maybe treating her differently once he was proven wrong. However, he did mention treating her the same as others. \n\nIn conclusion, if the rules were applied equally and the leader followed the same process with everyone, then he's not in the wrong. But if there was inconsistency in rule enforcement, then he is. The story hints at possible inconsistency because the team members were upset with him even though they agreed on the rules. It's possible that the leader's enforcement was too rigid, leading to the team's backlash. So, the answer might be that he is in the wrong because he didn't apply the rules consistently, or maybe not, because the rules were clear. Hmm.\n"
