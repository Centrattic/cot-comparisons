We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is the team leader of an Airsoft team with strict rules. They had a girl named Madison join, and she was good at the game. The team agreed that she should be treated the same as everyone else. The first issue was her hair color, which was bright red and she refused to cover it up. The team leader enforced the rule, but others got upset. Then there were issues with her not buying the required gear and violating the military-realistic clothing policy. The final straw was when she wore a belly shirt and showed off welts, leading the leader to kick her off. This caused a backlash from the team, others at the field, and even the field owner, who banned him based on a rumor.\n\nSo the question is whether the team leader was in the wrong for enforcing the rules. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the team had established rules that everyone agreed to, including the uniform requirements. Madison was aware of these rules because she was informed when she joined. The leader mentioned that the rules were there to maintain a professional appearance for tournaments. That seems reasonable. However, the way he handled the enforcement might be an issue.\n\nWhen Madison first showed up with the red hair, the leader asked her to cover it. She took it off mid-game, and the leader called her out. The team and others at the field told him to \"chill out.\" Maybe his approach was too strict? If the rules were supposed to be applied equally, but the team reacted negatively, perhaps there's inconsistency in enforcement or maybe the rules were too rigid without room for exceptions.\n\nThen there's the issue of the gear. The leader required proof of purchase for the $400 uniform. Madison kept saying she was working on it but didn't follow through. The leader may have been right to ask for proof, but maybe he could have been more flexible? Or perhaps he needed to check in more regularly instead of waiting until the last minute.\n\nThe final incident was Madison wearing a belly shirt. The leader reminded her of the military-realistic rule, she apologized, and then he kicked her off. The problem here might be that the leader waited until a significant infraction occurred instead of addressing smaller ones earlier. Maybe a pattern of non-compliance was forming, and the leader didn't handle it step-by-step. Also, the public nature of the confrontation might have contributed to the backlash, making him seem harsher than necessary.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic with the team. The leader mentioned that even his friends were being friendlier to Madison, which could have caused tension. But the leader's responsibility is to enforce the rules consistently. If the team started turning on him because they felt he was being too strict, maybe the rules need revisiting or better communication. However, that doesn't necessarily mean he was in the wrong for enforcing them.\n\nThe aftermath was bad: team members quit, others wanted to have a meeting, and the field owner banned him. That's a lot of fallout. But was the leader's action justified? Enforcing rules is part of leadership, especially in a competitive setting where professionalism is required. However, the way he handled it might have been too abrupt or inflexible. Perhaps he could have had a more gradual approach, like warnings before kicking her off. Or maybe the rules themselves are unrealistic or discriminatory in some way (like the military-realistic policy excluding bright colors or anime, which might be subjective).\n\nAlso, considering that Madison was a woman in a male-dominated sport, there could be underlying issues about how she was treated. The leader's initial assumption that she was trying to gain followers might have influenced his judgment, even if he tried to be fair. The team's reaction suggests that they might have felt he was being unfair to her, possibly because of her gender. However, the rules apply to everyone, so that shouldn't matter.\n\nIn terms of the rules, if they are clearly stated and applied equally, the leader isn't necessarily wrong. But if the rules are inconsistently enforced or if there's a pattern of leniency towards others, then the leader is in the wrong. The user says that when Madison first joined, the team agreed to treat her the same, but others started being more lenient with her. The leader tried to enforce the rules, but the team didn't support him. That could mean the team is okay with bending the rules for her, which undermines the leader's authority.\n\nHowever, the leader's strict enforcement might have been seen as harsh because Madison was popular and a model, making others reluctant to support his strictness. There's a balance between maintaining team standards and being inclusive. If the rules are too rigid without flexibility, they can create a hostile environment. The leader might need to revisit the rules to see if they're practical and fair.\n\nIn conclusion, the leader's actions were in line with the rules he set, but the way he enforced them and the team's reaction might indicate that the rules need adjustment or that communication and flexibility were lacking. However, as a leader, enforcing rules is part of the job. The key question is whether the rules were fair and consistently applied. If so, he's not in the wrong. If the rules are problematic or he was too inflexible, then maybe he is. I think the answer hinges on whether the rules are reasonable and whether the leader gave adequate warnings. Since the user waited for multiple infractions and then acted, it's a bit of a grey area. But given that he had prior issues and the team didn't support him, it's possible he was too strict, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
