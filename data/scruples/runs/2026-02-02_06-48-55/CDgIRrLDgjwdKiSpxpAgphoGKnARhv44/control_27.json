We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team because she wasn't following the team's rules. The rules include things like no bright colors, specific uniform gear, etc. The team has these rules for a military-realistic theme and professionalism.\n\nThe girl, Madison, joined and was good at the game, but she started not following the rules: red hair, not wearing the required uniform, and even wore a belly shirt. The leader enforced the rules, but the team and others started to side with her, leading to the leader being shunned and even getting a 3-week ban from the field.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If they were set in advance and everyone agreed to them, including new members, then enforcing them should be fair. The problem here is that Madison wasn't following them, so the leader had to act. However, maybe the way he handled it was too harsh? For example, when she took off the beanie during the game, maybe he could have been more flexible, considering it's uncomfortable. But then again, rules are rules, especially if they're for team cohesion and professionalism.\n\nAnother point is that the team reacted negatively to the leader enforcing the rules. They might be biased towards Madison because she's a woman in a male-dominated sport and looks like a model. There could be underlying sexism here, but the leader claims the issue is strictly about following the rules. However, the fact that other team members were lenient with her might indicate that the rules were not consistently enforced, making the leader's strictness stand out as unfair.\n\nAlso, the leader's own admission that he did a Google search to check her Instagram before she joined might suggest some bias. He thought she might be there just for attention, which could imply he had preconceived notions about her. When she proved herself to be a good player, he still held onto his initial judgment, maybe leading to stricter enforcement on her.\n\nWhen things escalated, the leader gave her an ultimatum about the uniform, and when she didn't comply, he kicked her out. The emotional reaction and the subsequent fallout might have been because the leader was seen as harsh, even if he was technically following the rules. The team might feel that the rules weren't applied equally, especially if others didn't face the same consequences for minor violations. \n\nMoreover, the leader's communication might have been part of the problem. Instead of giving her more time or addressing the issues in a more cooperative way, he abruptly asked her to leave, which led to a breakdown. If he had handled it more diplomatically, maybe the reaction wouldn't have been so severe. \n\nIn terms of the Airsoft field owner's reaction, a rumor that he yelled led to a ban. This shows how the leader's actions were perceived as abusive, even if he didn't yell. The team's loyalty might have been tested, and their turning against him suggests that his approach was seen as overly strict or unfair, even if the rules exist.\n\nSo, the question is whether the leader was in the wrong. On one hand, he had rules and tried to enforce them. On the other hand, the context shows possible inconsistency in enforcement, potential bias, and poor handling of the situation. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the rules were clear, but the way he handled the situation and the team's reaction could imply that he was too rigid, leading to negative consequences. Maybe there's a balance between enforcing rules and maintaining team morale and fairness. The leader might have failed to address the underlying issues, like the team's leniency towards Madison, instead of just focusing on her rule-breaking. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not managing the team dynamics properly and perhaps enforcing the rules in a way that seems biased or overly harsh, leading to the team's backlash.\n"
