We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a team leader in an Airsoft team who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't comply with the rules. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The team has strict rules about uniforms\u2014military-realistic, no bright colors, etc. They require members to buy specific gear. The girl, Madison, joined and initially impressed with her skills but didn't follow the dress code. The leader enforced the rules, but the team and others started turning on him. He ended up being penalized by the field owner due to a rumor.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that he was enforcing the rules everyone agreed upon. The problem is whether that enforcement was reasonable or if he overstepped. \n\nLet me break down the main issues:\n\n1. **Rule Enforcement**: The team had rules, and the author was trying to apply them to Madison. However, others felt he was being too strict, especially after others had previously bent the rules without consequences. For example, the team meeting before her arrival about not hitting on her, but even his friends were friendlier. This might suggest a double standard. Also, when he first asked her to cover her hair, the team told him to chill out. So maybe the rules weren't being consistently enforced before.\n\n2. **Consistency**: If the team had been lenient with other members (like the mention of others bending the rules), then enforcing the rules strictly on Madison could be seen as unfair. It might look like discrimination or favoritism towards others. The author's friends bending over backwards to be friendly to her might have already undermined the team's claimed strictness.\n\n3. **Communication and Flexibility**: The author gave Madison a chance to comply with the uniform requirements but she kept saying she was working on it. However, he might have been too rigid without considering if there were extenuating circumstances. Maybe he could have had a more detailed discussion or given her more time? Or maybe there's a lack of clear deadlines mentioned. The author says she kept saying \"I'm working on it,\" but if there was no clear timeline, perhaps the author didn't follow up properly.\n\n4. **Reaction to Non-Compliance**: The author's decision to kick her out led to a breakdown in the team. Did he handle it in a way that was respectful and gave her a chance to correct her behavior? Or was it abrupt? The fact that she started crying might indicate that the confrontation was harsh, which could have been avoided with a more empathetic approach.\n\n5. **Perception and Team Morale**: The author's reputation as a hard-ass might have contributed to the negative reaction. If the team had a history of him being strict, others might have been more inclined to side against him when a conflict arose. The owner's decision to ice him based on a rumor (even if false) shows how perception can be damaging. But does that mean the author was in the wrong?\n\n6. **Unfair Treatment Based on Appearance**: The author was initially skeptical of Madison due to her looks and online presence, which might have influenced his interactions. The article mentions that the team is 95% male and that a \"hot girl\" would change dynamics. This could imply that the author was influenced by gender stereotypes, possibly leading to unfair treatment. Even if the rules are the same, the perception that he was targeting her because she's a woman might play into the team's reaction.\n\n7. **Consequences and Proportionality**: Kicking someone off a team is a significant consequence. Was this the only option? The author could have suspended her, given a warning, or explored alternatives. The fact that the team started turning on him after the kickout suggests that the action was seen as harsh or unnecessary by many.\n\n8. **Ownership of Rules**: The author mentions that the rules were agreed upon by the team. But if the team members were not consistently following them themselves, or if the author was the one enforcing them selectively, then the rules might not be perceived as fair. The team's reaction to the hair incident (telling him to chill) indicates that the rules might not have been as strictly enforced as he thought.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have intended to enforce the rules, the way he did it (especially the sudden kickout without more attempts to resolve the issue) and the possible inconsistencies in rule enforcement likely contributed to the team's backlash. The presence of gender dynamics (a female in a male-dominated team) and the perception of unfair treatment could also be factors. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions were both fair and consistent with the team's previous behavior. Given the team's leniency before and the harsh reaction from others, it's possible that the author overstepped, making him at least partially at fault.\n"
