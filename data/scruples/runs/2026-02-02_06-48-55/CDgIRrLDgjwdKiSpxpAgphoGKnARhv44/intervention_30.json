We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the Airsoft team story is in the wrong. The options are A or B, yes or no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is the team leader of a competitive Airsoft team. They have strict rules about uniforms being military-realistic, no bright colors, etc. The team has a statewide ranking and participates in national tournaments. The girl Madison joined the team, and despite her being a model with a large Instagram following, she ended up being a good player. However, she didn't follow the rules: dyed her hair bright red, wore a belly shirt, and didn't purchase the required gear. The author tried to enforce the rules, which led to the team turning against him, some quitting, and the field owner banning him based on a rumor of yelling.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The key points here are about enforcing rules and how it was handled. The rules were set two years ago, and the team had agreed to treat Madison the same as others. But when the author tried to enforce them, the team and others at the field were critical. \n\nI need to consider if the author was right to kick her off. The rules were clear, and if the team agreed to them, then enforcing them seems fair. However, the way he handled it might have been an issue. For example, when she first had the bright hair, he made her cover it, and the team got upset. Then, he asked for proof of gear purchase, which she didn't provide, leading to the eventual kick. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the author was too strict or didn't consider that the team might be lenient towards her. The fact that others thought he was being a hard ass and that the field owner banned him based on a rumor could indicate that his approach was too harsh, even if the rules existed. Also, the team had already agreed that she should be treated the same, but then they weren't following through when it came to other guys being friendlier. The author might have been trying to maintain consistency, but the reaction of the team and others suggests that his enforcement was not well-received. \n\nAnother angle: the author's initial assumption about Madison's intentions (thinking she was just using the team for Instagram followers) could have influenced his strict enforcement. If he was biased, maybe that's a problem. However, he later acknowledges that she was a good player and didn't mention her looks as the main issue, but perhaps that initial bias affected his judgment. \n\nAlso, the way he confronted her might have been abrupt. When he told her to leave, she cried, and others took that as him being an asshole. Maybe he should have given her more time or addressed the issues in a calmer, more supportive manner. Enforcing rules is important, but how it's done matters. \n\nIn a team setting, leadership is about maintaining team cohesion. If the team is splitting because of strict enforcement, even if the rules are clear, perhaps the author didn't handle it well. The rules might need to be adjusted if they're causing more harm than good, but the user is asking if the author was in the wrong. \n\nThe girl didn't comply with the rules, so from a strict standpoint, the author was right to enforce them. However, the team's reaction and the fact that the rules were previously not enforced when others might have broken them (since the team is mostly male and maybe some had bright hair or other items) could mean that the rules are inconsistent. The author might have been right to enforce the rules but the execution led to negative consequences because the team wasn't respecting the rules uniformly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rules are outdated. If the team is 95% male and some members are being lenient, the author might have been trying to hold the team to its own standards. But the author's personal feelings (being annoyed) could have played a role. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the rules were applied fairly and consistently. If the team had previously agreed to the rules and the author had enforced them for others, then he's not in the wrong. But if the team typically bent the rules for other members, then the author was trying to be strict but came off as harsh. However, the story says the team agreed to treat her the same, and when he enforced the rules, they got upset. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the rules, but the way he did it and the team's reaction might be more about how he's perceived as a hard ass. However, the rules are part of the team's identity. Maybe he's right to enforce them, but the team is being too lenient. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the facts. \n\nAnother point: the author asked for proof of purchases, which she didn't provide. That's part of the team requirements, so not fulfilling that could be a valid reason. However, he might have needed to give her a clearer deadline or follow-up. \n\nIn conclusion, if the rules were clear and consistently applied, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the team had a history of being lenient, maybe he's not. The problem is that the team turned on him, but that's their reaction, not necessarily his fault. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but I need to check all angles again. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that even his oldest friends treated her differently. So the rules were not consistently enforced, and the author was trying to uphold them. The team's backlash might be because they prefer to not enforce the rules strictly when it's a girl they find attractive. In that case, the author was right to enforce the rules as agreed. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But maybe the author should have considered the team's dynamics more, and that's where the mistake is. \n\nHmm. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just if the team is upset. The rules were set, and the author tried to enforce them. If the rules are part of the team's identity, then he's justified. However, the manner of enforcement could be a problem. But the story doesn't say he was abusive or used yelling. The field owner banned him due to a rumor of yelling. If that's not accurate, then the author is a victim of the situation, but the team's reaction is still a problem. \n\nIn the end, the author followed the established rules, so he's not in the wrong for kicking her off. The team's reaction is a consequence, but the initial action of enforcing the rules is correct. So the answer is B.\n"
