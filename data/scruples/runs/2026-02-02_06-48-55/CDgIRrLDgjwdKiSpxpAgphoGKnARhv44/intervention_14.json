We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an Airsoft team leader who kicked a girl off the team because she didn't follow their rules. The team has strict military-realistic rules, like no bright colors, anime stuff, etc. The girl in question, Madison, joined and was good at the game, but she didn't comply with the dress code at times, like the red hair and a belly shirt. The author enforced the rules, leading to her removal, which caused a backlash from others.\n\nFirst, the team had established rules that everyone agreed to, including new members. The problem comes from the enforcement of those rules. The author mentions that the team had a meeting and agreed to treat Madison the same as others, but when she broke the rules, he called her out. However, his team members and others at the field thought he was too harsh. Then, after the hair incident, Madison didn't follow through on ordering the required gear and later wore inappropriate clothing. The author then dismissed her, leading to a lot of backlash.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Were the rules communicated clearly? The author says they have been in place for two years and everyone agreed to them. So, if Madison was aware of these rules when she joined, then she should have known the expectations. However, maybe the issue is that the enforcement wasn't consistent. The author mentions that others on his team thought he was being too strict, and even after the first incident, they didn't support his actions. This inconsistency might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the treatment of Madison. The author's team had a prior agreement to treat her the same, but perhaps the author's strictness led to her feeling unsupported. The fact that she started crying and others saw the author as the villain might indicate that his approach was too harsh, even if the rules are valid. The question is whether enforcing the rules in a way that caused emotional distress is appropriate, especially if the team's own members are critical of the leader's methods.\n\nAlso, the author's personal motivations might play a role. Initially, he thought she was just using the team for attention, but she proved herself. However, when she didn't comply, he enforced the rules. But his team's reaction suggests that maybe the rules were more flexible in practice, or that the author's strict enforcement was out of step with the team's culture.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a balance between upholding team rules and the way he handled the situation. If the rules were clear and he enforced them fairly, he might not be in the wrong. But if he applied them inconsistently or his approach was unnecessarily harsh, leading to negative consequences, then he could be at fault. The fact that his team members and others turned against him might indicate that his actions were seen as unfair, even if the rules technically exist. So, the answer might hinge on whether the enforcement was reasonable and respectful.\n"
