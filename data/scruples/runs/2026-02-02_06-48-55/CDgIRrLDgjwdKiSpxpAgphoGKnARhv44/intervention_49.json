We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking a girl off their Airsoft team because she didn't follow the rules. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the author is the team leader and mentions they have strict rules for the competition team, including specific uniforms and a military-realistic theme. They also mention that people can choose not to join if they don't like the rules. \n\nMadison joined, and despite initial skepticism because of her background as a model with a big Instagram following, she turned out to be a good player. However, she started violating the rules: dyed red hair, not covering it, wearing a belly shirt, and not purchasing the required uniform gear. The author tried to enforce the rules each time, but the team and others at the field criticized the author for being too strict. \n\nThe breaking point was when the author kicked her off for non-compliance, leading to a backlash from the team, other teams, and even the field owner, who banned the author. The author feels they were just upholding the rules but now face being ousted from their leadership role.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author established rules that everyone agreed to, and if someone can't follow them, it's fair to enforce the rules. The author's responsibility as a team leader is to maintain team cohesion and professionalism, especially in a competitive setting. Not enforcing rules could lead to others not following them, which would undermine the team's standards.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was too strict or applied the rules inconsistently. For example, the hair issue: maybe the red hair was a minor violation, and the requirement for a beanie might have been overly strict. Also, there's the aspect of treating Madison differently due to her appearance, possibly influenced by bias from the team's reactions. The author mentioned that the team was treating her more friendlier, but he also had to remind them to treat her the same. If the rules were applied to everyone else without such issues, that's a problem. However, if the rules were clear and applied to everyone, then the author might be in the right.\n\nAnother point is communication. Did the author clearly explain the rules and consequences? If Madison had trouble with the requirements, maybe there was a lack of support or understanding her situation. For example, maybe the uniform cost ($400) is a barrier, but the author states that people don't have to join if they don't want to comply. However, if the team's culture is changing because of her presence, the author has a duty to maintain the team's standards.\n\nAlso, the backlash from the team and others might suggest that the author's enforcement was too harsh or that there's a cultural issue within the team. The fact that others accused the author of being a hard ass and the team members quitting might indicate that the author's approach was damaging team morale without valid reason. However, the rules were in place before Madison joined, so it's not like they were created in response to her.\n\nIn the end, the author did enforce the rules as stated, but maybe the way they handled the situation was confrontational. Kicking her off without allowing her to comply might have been a mistake if there was a way to resolve the issues. For example, giving her a deadline to get the uniform or adjusting the hair rule temporarily if it's a valid comfort issue. However, if the rules are non-negotiable for the team's success, then the author's actions are justified.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the right, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe the key is whether the rules were enforced fairly and consistently. If the author applied the rules as agreed and Madison had the means to comply but refused, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the rules were arbitrary or not properly communicated, then the author might be at fault. Given the information, the rules were established, and the author tried to enforce them. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
