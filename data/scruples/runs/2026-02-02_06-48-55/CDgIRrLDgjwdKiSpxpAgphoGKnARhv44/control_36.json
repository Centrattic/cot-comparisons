We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a girl off their Airsoft team because she didn't follow the rules. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is the team leader with strict rules about uniforms and military realism. They had a girl, Madison, join, and she was good at the game. But she kept violating the dress code\u2014like bright hair, not wearing the required gear. The team leader tried to enforce the rules, but others started to side with Madison, leading to team conflict and even the team leader getting banned from the field.\n\nSo, the key points here are the rules enforcement and the team's reaction. The author had set clear rules before Madison joined, and she was aware of them. The problem seems to be that she consistently didn't follow them, and the team leader felt the need to remove her to maintain team standards. However, the way it was handled might have been an issue. The leader called her out in front of others, which could have been perceived as harsh, leading to Madison crying and others taking her side quickly. \n\nThe team leader's actions were based on existing rules, which is understandable in a competitive environment where uniformity and professionalism are important. But the social dynamics here are tricky. The team leader's enforcement might have been too strict, especially if the rules were not consistently applied before. Also, the emotional response from Madison and the team's backlash suggest that the leader's approach might not have been the best in terms of communication or sensitivity to how others perceive the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the team leader's initial skepticism about Madison joining, thinking she might be using the team for followers. That could have biased his judgment later on, making him more rigid in enforcement. Plus, the team's reaction indicates that maybe the rules were not as rigidly enforced before Madison's arrival, leading to perceptions of unfair treatment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author followed the rules as set, but the execution might have been flawed. Enforcing rules is necessary for team cohesion, but the method of enforcement and how it's communicated can affect team dynamics. If the team leader was too abrupt and didn't allow for flexibility or dialogue, that could have contributed to the negative outcome. However, the core issue is whether the rules were clear and enforced consistently. If the rules were always in place and communicated, then removing her was justified, even if the delivery was rough. But if the enforcement was inconsistent or the leader had a biased view, that's where he might be at fault.\n\nI think the answer is B (No). The author was enforcing the rules that were agreed upon, and the team's reaction is more about their own biases and the social dynamics rather than the leader being wrong. However, there's a nuance in how the situation was handled, but the core decision to enforce rules isn't wrong.\n"
