We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Airsoft team situation is in the wrong. So, AITA (Am I the Asshole) style.\n\nFirst, the context: The team leader has strict rules about military-realistic appearance, like no bright colors, anime, etc. They require $400 in uniform gear for the competition team. A girl named Madison joins, is good at the game, but doesn't follow the rules. She has dyed red hair with ponytail things, and later a belly shirt. The leader enforces the rules, leading to her being kicked off, which causes her to cry and others to turn against him. \n\nThe key points here are about enforcing rules consistently and the potential for bias. The leader claims the rules are for a professional look and that everyone must follow them. However, the team members started to argue against him when he enforced the rules on Madison. Also, after he kicked her off, he faced backlash, with some members quitting and others planning to discuss his leadership. \n\nNow, the question is whether the leader is wrong. The rules were set in advance, and he tried to apply them to her. But maybe the rules were arbitrary or not clearly communicated? The user mentions that when others saw the situation, they took Madison's side, which might indicate that the leader's approach was too harsh or that the rules were not widely accepted. \n\nAlso, the leader's initial hesitation because of Madison's appearance might suggest a bias, even if he later tried to enforce the rules. The team's reaction could stem from perceiving the rules as being used to target her specifically. \n\nBut the leader did enforce the rules as written, which is important. If the rules were established and applied uniformly, then he might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that other team members and even other teams felt he was being a hard-ass suggests that the rules might not be as clearly accepted as he thought. \n\nThe $400 uniform requirement could be a barrier, especially if the team is supposed to be inclusive. But he did mention that people don't have to join if they don't like the rules. The issue is with Madison not following the rules, and the leader's response causing team conflict. \n\nThe leader's motivation might be a factor. Did he intend to be unfair, or was he just trying to maintain team standards? The crying and the subsequent backlash might have been a result of the social dynamics rather than his actions being inherently wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person did something objectively wrong or if it's a matter of differing opinions. If the rules were clear and applied fairly, even if the outcome is unpopular, the leader might not be in the wrong. But if the rules were inconsistently enforced or if the leader had a double standard, then he would be. \n\nThe story says that the team had a meeting before she arrived to agree to treat her the same. So he tried to be fair. However, the team's reaction after the hair incident suggests they didn't agree with his strictness. The leader's actions were based on rules, but the social fallout might be a consequence of those rules not being well-received in the community. \n\nAlso, the field owner iced him due to a rumor of yelling, which complicates things. Maybe he didn't actually yell, but the perception was bad. \n\nIn conclusion, the leader tried to enforce rules that were set, but the way he did it and the team's perception might have made him seem like an asshole. The rules might be a problem if they're arbitrary or not necessary for the team's goals, leading to a conflict of values. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because the rules might be discriminatory or not essential, and his strict enforcement caused unnecessary harm. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the rules are legitimate and he applied them fairly. But given the social dynamics and the team's backlash, perhaps the rules were more about appearance than performance, which could be seen as discriminatory. So the answer might be A.\n"
