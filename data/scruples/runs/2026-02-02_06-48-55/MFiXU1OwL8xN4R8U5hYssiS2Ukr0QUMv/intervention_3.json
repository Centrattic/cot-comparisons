She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing when they called the girl a \"bitch\" for being \"just honest.\" The situation involves a girl who's part of the group but not really part of their actual social circle. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author was fed up and called her out, which led to her leaving.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about whether the author overreacted. The girl was already known for being mean and not taking criticism well. The author's friends were also tired of her but didn't want to confront her because she gets defensive. The author decided to step in when she made a hurtful comment towards a friend. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, calling someone a \"bitch\" isn't exactly constructive feedback. It's pretty harsh and might not resolve the issue. It could make things more hostile. The girl did say she was just kidding, which might mean she didn't recognize the harm in her words, but the author's response was equally harsh. So maybe the author should have found a less confrontational way to address it?\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's behavior was clearly problematic. She was making fun of someone's appearance, which is a sensitive topic. The author might have felt that pointing out her behavior was necessary, especially since others weren't doing it. However, using a term like \"bitch\" might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author was justified in wanting to stop her insults but could have done so more effectively.\n\nAlso, the friend who told the author to talk to her tomorrow suggests that confrontation might not be the best way. Maybe a calm conversation would have been better. The author's comment might have come off as an attack rather than a critique of her behavior, leading to the girl's defensive reaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they used a harsh insult which escalated the situation instead of addressing the issue constructively. Even if the girl's behavior was wrong, the approach taken by the author may not have been the most effective or respectful way to handle it. The author's friends might be right in thinking they went too far, even if the underlying issue was valid.\n"
