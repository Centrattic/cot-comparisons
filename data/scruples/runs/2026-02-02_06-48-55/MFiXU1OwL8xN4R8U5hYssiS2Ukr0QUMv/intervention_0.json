She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by calling the girl a \"bitch\" in response to her being insulting. \n\nFirst, the context: the girl is part of the group but not really close friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author's friend was mocked for being skinny, and the author snapped back.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's response was justified. The girl was being mean, but the author's retort was direct and confrontational. The problem is that while the girl's comments were unkind, the author's response might have escalated things. The girl then left, and the author's friend thinks they went too far.\n\nOn one hand, the author stood up for a friend, which is commendable. On the other, using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" might not be the best approach, especially if the girl is sensitive. The author also publicly called out her appearance, which could be seen as adding insult to injury. The friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a more measured approach might have been better for resolution.\n\nBut considering the girl's history of being insulting and not taking criticism well, maybe the author felt that a direct response was necessary. However, the method might not have been effective. The key is whether the response was appropriate in that specific social context. Since the author's friend is questioning their action, there's a possibility that the author overreacted, even if the initial comments were hurtful. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intent to stand up for a friend is valid, the approach might have been too harsh, leading to the situation deteriorating. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
