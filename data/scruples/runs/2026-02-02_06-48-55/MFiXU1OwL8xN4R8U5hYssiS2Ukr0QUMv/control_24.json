She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl who's part of their group but is very insulting. The author called her out for being a bitch after she made a joke about a friend's body. The friend thinks the author went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. She's not part of the main group outside school. The author was defending their friend by pointing out her behavior. But was the response appropriate?\n\nCalling someone a \"bitch\" is pretty harsh. It's a derogatory term and could be seen as aggressive. Even if the girl was being mean, responding with another insult might not help. The author might have escalated the situation instead of addressing it calmly. The friend suggested talking to her tomorrow, which implies there might have been a cooler way to handle it.\n\nHowever, the girl's behavior was hurtful. The author stood up for their friend, which is a positive action. But the method used was confrontational. The key here is whether the response was justified. Since the girl was already making others uncomfortable, maybe the author felt they had to act, but the approach might not have been the best. \n\nAlso, considering that the girl is sensitive to criticism, the author's response might have made things worse. The girl left, and the situation became more tense. The author's friend is worried about further conflict. So, the author might have been in the right to stand up for their friend but used the wrong approach. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the intention was to stop harmful behavior, but the method was confrontational. The question is whether the response crossed a line. Since the author used a derogatory term and the situation escalated, it's possible they were in the wrong. However, defending against bullying or hurtful comments is important. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the response was harsh and could have been handled more constructively. But there's also the aspect of defending a friend. However, the use of \"bitch\" is problematic. So leaning towards A.\n"
