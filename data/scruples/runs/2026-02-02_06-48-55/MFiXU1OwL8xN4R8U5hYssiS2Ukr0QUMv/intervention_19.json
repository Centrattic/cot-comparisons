She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is part of a group of friends where a girl is around sometimes, but not really part of the close circle. She's known for being insulting a lot and uses \"I'm just being honest\" as an excuse. The author and friends are annoyed because she's harsh but none have addressed it. The girl made a comment about a friend's body, saying things like \"Are you sure you\u2019re not trans? I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic\" and \"It\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\" The author responds by calling her a bitch, pointing out she's not just being honest but being mean. The girl gets defensive, calls the author out, and leaves. The author's friend says they went too far.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants to know my take. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl in question is regularly insulting others and uses \"honesty\" as a shield. The author is defending a friend from a hurtful comment. The comment about someone's body is pretty harsh, especially questioning their gender and implying a disorder. That's definitely crossing a line.\n\nBut when the author responds by calling the girl a \"bitch,\" that's a derogatory term. Even if the girl's comments were hurtful, using a personal attack might not be the best approach. The author's friend mentioned it's awkward and the girl can't take jokes. So, the author's response might have escalated the situation. However, the original comment was harmful, so defending the friend is understandable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The girl was making a harmful, possibly transphobic and eating disorder-insensitive comment. The author's response was to call her a bitch, which is harsh but in response to a direct insult. The author also points out the girl's hypocrisy in making such comments given her own appearance. \n\nBut the problem is that the author used a personal attack instead of addressing the behavior. Maybe a better approach would be to tell the girl that her comments are hurtful and not okay, without name-calling. However, in the heat of the moment, people might not act rationally. The girl's comment was clearly out of line, so the author's frustration is valid. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the author should have handled it differently, perhaps with a more constructive response. However, the original comment by the girl was the root problem. The author's response, while not ideal, was a reaction to a harmful statement. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, using a harsh term isn't helpful. On the other, the girl's actions were the initial problem. \n\nI think the author's main issue was using a derogatory term instead of addressing the behavior. So maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong). But if the girl's comment was so offensive, maybe the author's response was justified. However, using \"bitch\" is still a personal attack. So, I'm leaning towards A, because even if the girl was being mean, the author could have handled it better without the name-calling. So the author is in the wrong for the method, even if the intent was to stand up for a friend.\n"
