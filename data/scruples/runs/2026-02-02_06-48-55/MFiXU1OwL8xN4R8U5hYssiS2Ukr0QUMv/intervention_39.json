She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) did the wrong thing by calling the girl a \"bitch\" after she made hurtful comments. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girl is part of the group but not really close friends. She's known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author was annoyed because she was making a joke about a friend's body, which is sensitive. The author responded by calling her out, which led to the girl getting upset and leaving.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author was defending their friend from what they saw as unwarranted criticism. But the response was confrontational and used a derogatory term. Even if the girl was being mean, using a swear word and public confrontation might have escalated the situation. The author's friend thinks it was too far, so there's a social consequence within their group.\n\nNow, considering whether it's in the wrong. The author had valid reasons to be upset with the girl's behavior. However, the way they addressed it might not have been the best approach. Instead of calling her a \"bitch,\" which is a harsh term and could come off as aggressive, maybe a more constructive approach would have been better. Also, the girl might not have taken it well, leading to her leaving in anger. \n\nBut the girl's behavior was also problematic. She was making hurtful remarks and dismissing others' feelings by claiming \"just being honest.\" The author's action was a direct response to protect their friend. However, using such a strong term might not be the most effective way to address the issue. It's a judgment call between defending a friend and maintaining group harmony.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes standing up for someone is seen as the right thing, but the method matters. If the author's goal was to stop the hurtful comments, maybe a different approach could have been better. So, the author might be in the wrong because their response was reactive and aggressive, even if the initial issue deserved addressing. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a calmer conversation might have been more effective.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their response was confrontational and potentially escalated the situation, even if their intention was to stand up for their friend.\n"
