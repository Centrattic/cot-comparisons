She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling a girl a bitch when she was making hurtful comments. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of the group but not close friends. She's known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author heard her mock a friend for being skinny with a trans comment and anorexia joke. The author responded by calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy about her own appearance. The friend thinks the author went too far, but the user is unsure.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are whether the girl's comments were actually honest or just mean. If she's using honesty as a cover to be cruel, then the author has a point. But did the author's response cross a line? The girl did get upset and left, which might indicate that the response was harsh. However, the author was standing up for their friend, which is understandable.\n\nBut is calling someone a bitch appropriate? It's a derogatory term that's often considered sexist when used against women. Even if the girl was being mean, responding with a sexist slur might perpetuate the same kind of toxic behavior. The author's friend might be right in suggesting that a more constructive approach would be better.\n\nAlso, the girl's reaction to criticism is a factor. If she's sensitive to being called out, maybe the author should have addressed her behavior without using an insult. Maybe there's a way to point out the hypocrisy without resorting to name-calling. The situation escalated, and now the girl left, which could lead to more tension in the group. The author might have felt justified, but the method of response could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author had a valid reason to be upset about their friend being mocked. However, the use of a derogatory term might not be the best way to address the issue. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for the manner in which they responded, even if the content of the response had merit. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow could be a better approach to de-escalate the situation.\n"
