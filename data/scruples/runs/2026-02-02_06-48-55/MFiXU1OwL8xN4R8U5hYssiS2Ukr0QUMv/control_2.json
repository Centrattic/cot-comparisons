She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling a girl a \"bitch\" when she was being insulting. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of the group but not a close friend. She's known for being insulting, often using \"I'm just being honest\" as a defense. The author had enough when she mocked a friend for being skinny, using a trans comment. The author called her out, saying she's being a bitch, not just honest. The friend advises against it, thinking it went too far.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the girl was clearly being mean and hurtful. The author stood up for their friend, which is commendable. But responding with \"you're being a bitch\" might have been a harsh way to do it. The girl also didn't take criticism well, which the author acknowledges. \n\nOn one hand, defending a friend from bullying is right. But the method could have been more constructive. The author's response might have escalated things, leading to the girl getting mad and leaving. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests a more mature approach could have been better. \n\nSo, the author's intention was good, but the approach might have been too aggressive. Maybe using a more assertive but respectful method would have been better. However, considering the girl's history of being insensitive and not taking feedback well, the author's reaction might be understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't entirely wrong for standing up to someone being cruel, but maybe the response wasn't the best. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the harsh language and potential escalation, but there's context. However, given the situation, maybe B (not in the wrong) makes sense because they were defending a friend. Hmm.\n"
