She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she made a comment about a friend being skinny. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the girl is part of the group but not really close friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author's friend thinks they went too far, but the author felt justified because the girl was being cruel.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl's behavior is consistently hurtful, she uses honesty as a defense, and she can't take jokes. The author confronted her directly, which led to the girl getting upset and leaving. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending their friend and standing up against bullying. On the other hand, using a harsh term like \"bitch\" might not be the best approach, especially in a public setting like lunch. It could escalate the situation. The author's friend is concerned about making things worse, which is valid because the girl tends to overreact.\n\nBut then, the girl's comments were clearly mean, and the author's response was a direct rebuke. It's possible that the author was right to speak up, but maybe the method could have been more constructive. However, the options are only A or B, not a nuanced answer. \n\nConsidering that the girl was being hurtful and the author's friends were fed up, the author might not be in the wrong. But using a derogatory term might not be the best approach. However, given the context, some might argue the author was justified in calling her out. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that maybe a calmer approach is better now, but the initial confrontation might have been necessary. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is B (No), because the author was defending against hurtful comments and the girl's behavior was problematic. The method might be debatable, but the action was in response to bullying.\n"
