She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is part of a group of friends, and there's a girl who's sort of in the group but they don't hang out outside school. She's very insulting all the time, and she uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The friends are all annoyed but haven't said anything because she's sensitive and takes things out of proportion. Today, the girl made fun of one of the author's friends for being skinny, saying things like questioning if the friend is trans and calling it unattractive. The author then told her she's not just being honest but a \"bitch,\" and when the girl said it was a joke, the author retorted that no one thinks she's funny and told her to take a look at herself. The girl got mad and left, and one friend said the author went too far.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about whether the author's response was appropriate. The girl's behavior has been a problem\u2014constantly insulting others and not taking criticism well. The author's friend group is already uncomfortable with her, but they haven't confronted her because she's sensitive. The trigger was the girl making a hurtful comment about a friend's body, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nThe author called the girl a \"bitch,\" which is a strong and disrespectful term. Even if the girl was being insulting, using such language might be seen as crossing a line. The author's friend's reaction suggests that maybe the response was harsh. However, the girl's comment about the friend's body could be considered cruel or even bullying, so the author might feel justified in calling her out. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of respect and conflict resolution, name-calling can escalate the situation and may not be constructive. The girl might have felt attacked and left because of that. The author's intention was to put a stop to the girl's hurtful behavior, but the method might have been too aggressive. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girl's behavior is consistently toxic and the group is uncomfortable, maybe the author was right to set a boundary. The term \"bitch\" is derogatory, though. Maybe there's a more constructive way to address it without name-calling. But given the context, the author's friends might have appreciated the stand, even if the wording was harsh. \n\nI need to consider the norms of interpersonal conflict. Usually, it's better to address hurtful behavior without being personally aggressive. However, in a group setting where others are silent, the author might have felt it necessary to speak up. The girl's comment about body image is particularly sensitive and can be harmful, so the author's reaction could be seen as standing up against that. \n\nBut the use of the word \"bitch\" is derogatory towards women and can be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author meant it as a put-down for the girl's behavior, the word choice might be problematic. The girl's response was anger and leaving, which might have been expected. The author's friend is concerned, suggesting that maybe the author could have handled it differently. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the girl's behavior is really problematic, the author might feel justified. But the method used could be seen as inappropriate because it's name-calling. The answer might depend on whether the term \"bitch\" is acceptable in this context. Some might say it's a necessary confrontation, others might say it's not the right approach. I think the answer is A (Yes), because name-calling, even when defending against it, isn't productive and could be seen as rude. But others might argue B (No) if they believe the girl needed to be called out for her harmful comments. I'm leaning towards A because of the derogatory language used, but the situation is complicated.\n"
