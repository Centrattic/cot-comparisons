She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl who's part of their friend group but is very insulting. The author called her out for being a bitch when she made a joke about a friend's body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl often insults others and says she's just being honest, but doesn't take criticism well. The author was defending their friend by confronting her. The friend suggested the author went too far, but others are also fed up.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, calling someone a \"bitch\" is pretty harsh. Even if the girl was being mean, the author's response might have been aggressive. But the girl kept making hurtful comments under the guise of honesty. Maybe the author was trying to stand up for their friend, which is understandable. However, the approach might not be the best. Instead of calling her names, addressing the behavior in a calm manner could have been more effective. The girl's response was to leave, so maybe it escalated things. But considering the ongoing behavior, the author's frustration is valid. It's a bit of a judgment call. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate. The girl's comments were about someone's body, which is a sensitive topic. The author's comment was direct but perhaps not the best way to handle it. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for the harsh language, but also B, considering defending against the girl's behavior. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer might lean towards A because confronting someone with a harsh insult can be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was good. So the answer is A.\n"
