She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she made hurtful comments. \n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of their circle but not really a close friend. She's known for being insulting, often saying she's \"just being honest,\" but she can't take jokes herself. The author's friend was insulted about being skinny, and the author responded by calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy.\n\nThe author's friend thinks they went too far. Now, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl's behavior is consistently hurtful, the author confronted her in a public setting, and the response was harsh. Even though the girl's behavior is problematic, the author's response might not be the best approach. Confronting someone with a derogatory term in front of others can escalate tensions and doesn't address the issue constructively. The author might have a valid point about the girl's behavior, but the way they expressed it could be seen as aggressive rather than a solution. Plus, the girl's reactions suggest she's sensitive, so the author's approach might not lead to a positive outcome. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the intention was to stand up for their friend.\n"
