She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a \"bitch\" when she was being insulting. The scenario is that the girl is part of their friend group but is known for being mean and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author confronted her after she made a joke about a friend's body.\n\nFirst, consider the girl's behavior. If she's consistently making others uncomfortable and not taking criticism well, maybe there's a pattern here. The author's friends are also tired of her but haven't spoken up before. The author's response was direct and confrontational. The girl then left, and the author's friend thinks they went too far.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The key points are: was the response appropriate given the context? The girl was making a hurtful comment, and the author called her out. However, using the word \"bitch\" might be seen as aggressive, even if the intent was to stop the bullying. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's approach might have been too harsh, leading to an awkward situation. On the other hand, the girl's constant negativity and the lack of previous intervention could justify the author's frustration.\n\nBut the author's approach was confrontational and public. Maybe a more constructive way would be to address the behavior privately, not in a way that escalates the situation. The author might have intended to stand up for their friend, but the method used could have been more effective. Also, the girl's response of telling him to \"go fuck yourself\" indicates the confrontation didn't go well.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's approach might not be the most effective or respectful way to handle the situation. They were right to address the hurtful comments, but their method was confrontational and could have made things worse. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the intent was good.\n"
