She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, there's this girl who's part of their friend group but not really. She's known for being insulting all the time and says she's \"just being honest.\" The author is fed up because she's always putting people down, even when they try to joke around. In this case, she's making a comment about a friend's body, saying they might be trans or anorexic, and then claiming it's just honesty. The author snaps and tells her she's being a bitch, which makes the girl leave. The friend thinks the author went too far and wants to talk to her the next day. The author is conflicted now.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the girl's behavior: she's consistently insulting others and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. That's not healthy. People shouldn't be allowed to hurt others under the guise of honesty. The author's friend is being targeted with body-shaming comments, which is particularly sensitive and can be harmful. The author steps in to defend their friend, which is understandable.\n\nBut the way the author responded was by calling the girl a bitch and confronting her in front of others. That might have been a harsh reaction. Even if the girl's comments were hurtful, responding with a direct insult can escalate the situation. The author might have made things more awkward or defensive for the girl, leading to her leaving and the conflict worsening.\n\nThe author's friend suggests talking to her the next day, which could be a better approach. Addressing the behavior calmly might lead to a more constructive conversation. However, the author's intent was to stop the bullying, which is commendable. The problem is the method\u2014public confrontation with a harsh insult could have been avoided. \n\nBut also, the girl has a history of being insulting and not taking criticism. So the author might feel that a direct approach is necessary because past attempts to address her were ignored. The line between defending a friend and escalating conflict is thin here. The author's actions could be seen as justifiable if they're standing up against bullying, but the method might be questionable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had good intentions but used a confrontational approach. The girl's behavior was definitely problematic, but the response might not have been the best way to handle it. So, depending on perspective, the author could be seen as in the right for standing up for their friend, or in the wrong for not handling it more diplomatically.\n"
