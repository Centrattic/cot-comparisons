She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing. The scenario is about a girl who's part of the group but isn't really friends with them. She's always being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author confronts her when she mocks a friend for being skinny, calls her a bitch, and points out she's not funny. The friend says the author went too far.\n\nHmm. The key points here: the girl's behavior is ongoing, and others are also annoyed but haven't spoken up. The author steps in when the girl is being cruel. But the response is pretty harsh\u2014calling her a bitch and telling her to look at herself. The girl gets upset and leaves.\n\nSo, from one angle, the author is defending their friend and standing up against bullying. That's admirable. But the approach might have been confrontational. Even if the girl's comments were hurtful, responding with an insult might escalate the situation. The author's friend is worried that this could make things worse, especially since the girl is sensitive and might blow it out of proportion.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girl was being cruel, then the author had a reason to speak up. However, using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" might not be the most effective way to address the issue. It could come off as just as aggressive, even if the intention was to stop the bullying. The author's friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests a more constructive approach might have been better.\n\nAlso, the girl's behavior is a pattern, but the author's response is a direct confrontation in the moment. Maybe there's a middle ground. Instead of calling her a name, the author could have addressed the hurtful comments without matching the negativity. That might have de-escalated the situation more and still made a point.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the response was harsh and could undermine their message. Even if the girl deserved it, the method was counterproductive. The author's friend is right to think that maybe a different approach would have been better. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
