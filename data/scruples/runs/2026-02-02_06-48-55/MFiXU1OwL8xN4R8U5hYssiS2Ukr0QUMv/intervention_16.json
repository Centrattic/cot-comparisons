She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who's part of the group but isn't really a close friend. She's known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as a defense. The author confronts her after she makes a hurtful comment about a friend's body, calling her a bitch and saying others don't find her funny. The friend then says the author went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was appropriate. The girl made a mean comment about a friend's body, which is a sensitive topic. The author's response was direct and confrontational. While the girl's behavior was hurtful, responding with \"you're being a bitch\" might escalate the situation. The author's friend suggests talking to her the next day, which could be a more constructive approach. The author's approach led to the girl getting angry and leaving, which might have caused more tension without resolving the issue. So, even though the girl's behavior was bad, the author's method of confronting her might have been too harsh. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
