She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is part of a group that has a girl who's sort of in their circle but not really friends outside school. She's known for being insulting all the time and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author and friends are annoyed because she's rude, but they haven't said anything before because she gets defensive.\n\nNow, the main incident is that the girl made some really mean comments about a friend's body, using the \"just being honest\" line again. The author confronts her by calling her a bitch and tells her she's not just being honest. The girl gets mad and leaves. The author's friend is saying they went too far. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the girl was being rude and making hurtful comments. The author stood up for their friend by calling out the girl's behavior. On one hand, the author is defending their friend and addressing the bullying. On the other hand, the author used a harsh response (\"bitch\") and maybe escalated the situation. The friend suggests talking to her tomorrow, implying that maybe a calmer approach would be better.\n\nIs the author wrong for defending their friend? Well, bullying behavior should be addressed, but the method matters. If the author's response was aggressive, even if the girl was being a jerk, it might have been uncalled for. The line between standing up for someone and becoming aggressive yourself can be thin. The girl's comments were about body image, which is a sensitive issue. The author's response, while direct, might not have been the most effective or respectful way to handle it. Also, since the group was already annoyed but hadn't confronted her before, maybe the author took a more confrontational approach than others were comfortable with.\n\nBut then again, the girl was being consistently rude and the author was trying to protect their friend from hurtful comments. The author might have felt that a stronger reaction was necessary to stop the bullying. However, using an insult might not have been the best approach. Maybe a more constructive way to address it would have been better, like pointing out the inappropriateness of the comments without being offensive themselves.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girl's behavior is the issue, but the author's response could be seen as equally unkind. The author's friend is concerned that they went too far, which might indicate that their approach wasn't the most appropriate. There's a difference between calling someone out for their behavior and attacking them. The author might have overreacted by using a harsh insult instead of addressing the problem calmly. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the method they used, even if the intent was to stop the girl's hurtful comments.\n"
