She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the girl a \"bitch\" is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girl in question is part of the group but isn't really close. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as a defense. The author's friend was mocked about their weight, and the author confronted the girl.\n\nSo, the girl's behavior is ongoing\u2014she's constantly insulting others and can't take criticism. The author's response was direct and called her out for being a \"bitch\" instead of just honest. The friend later told the author they went too far.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the girl's actions were hurtful, and the author was defending a friend. The author's response was a direct confrontation, which might have been necessary given the girl's history. On the other hand, the author used a harsh term (\"bitch\") which could be seen as aggressive. But the context is that the girl was being cruel, so maybe the author's reaction is a justified call-out of her behavior. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently, like pointing out the insensitivity without using a curse word. But given the girl's history and the fact that others were afraid to speak up, the author might have been standing up for their friend. \n\nI think the key points are the girl's consistent behavior and the author's intent to stop the bullying. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have approached it more constructively. So the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
