She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone a bitch after the girl made a hurtful comment. The situation involves a group of friends where the girl is part of the lunch group but not really close. She's known for being insulting and using \"being honest\" as an excuse. The author, fed up, confronts her after she makes a joke about a friend's body.\n\nFirst, the girl's behavior: she's consistently insulting others and doesn't take criticism well. That's a problem. The author's friend is being mocked for being skinny, with a trans-insensitive comment. The author calls her a bitch, which is pretty harsh, but maybe justified given her repeated behavior.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points are: the girl was being cruel, and the author stood up for their friend. However, the author's response was confrontational and public. Even if the girl is a jerk, using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" can escalate things. Also, the author didn't approach her privately first. The group had talked about her before but didn't act. The author's friend thinks they went too far, which is a red flag. The girl might have blown it out of proportion, but the author's response could be seen as aggressive. So, while the girl's behavior is bad, the author's method of confronting her might not be the best. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the author's intent was good, but the method was poor. So, probably A.\n"
