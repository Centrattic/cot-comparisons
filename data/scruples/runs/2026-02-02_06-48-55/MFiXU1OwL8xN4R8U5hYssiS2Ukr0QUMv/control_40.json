She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong. The situation is about a girl who's part of their friend group but is very insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author calls her a bitch when she's being mean, and then the girl gets upset and leaves. The friend says the author went too far.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girl is being hurtful and not taking criticism well. The author might feel like they're standing up for their friend. On the other, calling someone a bitch in public could escalate things and make the situation worse, especially if the girl is already defensive. The author's friend suggests talking to her tomorrow, maybe to de-escalate. But the author might think they were justified because the girl was being mean. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, responding with a personal attack might not be the best approach. Maybe there's a better way to handle it without being rude. The girl's behavior is bad, but the author's response could be seen as aggressive. However, if the girl is constantly toxic, the author isn't entirely wrong to push back. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the author was right to stand up for the friend, others might say they should have handled it more carefully. The friend's feedback is also important. The answer isn't clear-cut, but perhaps leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the harsh response, even if the intent was good.\n"
