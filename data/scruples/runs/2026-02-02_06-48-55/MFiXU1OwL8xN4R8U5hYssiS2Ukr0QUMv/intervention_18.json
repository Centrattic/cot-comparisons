She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who's part of their friend group but is very insulting. The author called her a bitch after she made a joke about a friend's appearance. The friend thinks the author went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author's friend is in the group but they don't hang out outside school. The girl is sensitive to criticism herself. The author's response was direct and confrontational, telling her she's a bitch and pointing out her insensitivity. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. On one hand, defending a friend from hurtful comments is important. The girl's behavior was clearly problematic, and the author might have felt justified in calling her out. But the method used\u2014labeling her a \"bitch\"\u2014could be seen as aggressive or unkind, even if the intent was to stop her. \n\nAlso, the author's friend is upset and suggests talking to her the next day, which might imply that a more constructive approach could have been better. However, the author's tone was confrontational, which might escalate the situation. The girl's reaction was to get mad and leave, which could be a result of the direct insult. \n\nBut considering that the girl was already blowing things out of proportion and the group had discussed disliking her, maybe the author's response was a necessary boundary. Still, using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" isn't the most effective way to address the issue. It might have been more helpful to address her behavior without attacking her character. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up to the girl, but the choice of words could have been better. The key point is whether the response was proportional and aimed at changing behavior. The author's friend might prefer a different approach, but the core issue is the girl's constant insults. \n\nIn the end, while the intent was to call out harmful behavior, the method used was confrontational and might not have been the best approach. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the harsh wording even if the situation was bad.\n"
