She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted is at fault for calling a girl a \"bitch\" after she was being insulting. \n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of their friend group but not really close. She's known for being insulting and using \"I'm just being honest\" as an excuse. The author was fed up when she mocked a friend for being skinny, making comments about being trans and anorexic. The author then told her she's a bitch and pointed out she can't take jokes herself.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl's behavior is consistently hurtful, the author stood up for their friend, and the response was direct but aggressive. The friend is worried the author went too far.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. On one hand, the girl was being mean, and the author might feel justified in defending their friend. But on the other hand, responding with \"you're a bitch\" is pretty harsh and could be seen as escalating the conflict. The author could have chosen a different approach, like pointing out the insensitivity without personal attacks. Also, maybe confronting her in front of others wasn't the best idea if she's sensitive and reacts strongly.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the bullying, but their method might have been inappropriate. Using a derogatory term might not have been the most effective way, especially if the goal was to make her reflect on her behavior. Also, the girl's reaction of walking out might not have been the desired outcome if the author wanted to address the issue constructively.\n\nSo, while the girl's behavior is inexcusable, the author's response could be seen as overly aggressive. The friend's suggestion to talk to her the next day might have been better for a more constructive conversation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if the intent was good.\n"
