She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a girl who is part of the group but not really friends with them. She's known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author confronts her when she makes a joke about a friend's body, calling her a bitch instead. The friend says the author went too far. \n\nFirst, the girl's behavior is a problem. She's constantly making others feel bad, and the group is tired of it. The author's friends have discussed her but haven't acted because she overreacts. The key moment is when the girl mocks a friend's body, which is a sensitive topic. The author responds by calling her a bitch and pointing out she can't take jokes herself.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the girl's comments are hurtful and not just harmless teasing. The author is defending their friend, which can be seen as standing up for someone. But the method was confrontational. Instead of addressing the behavior calmly, the author used a harsh insult. Even if the girl deserved it, the response might have been more effective if it was direct but respectful. Also, the author's friends are concerned, so maybe they should have considered a different approach to avoid escalating things. However, the girl's behavior was toxic, and the author might feel justified in putting a stop to it. The line between standing up for someone and being aggressive is thin. The author's approach might have been too harsh, so maybe they are in the wrong for the tone rather than the intent. Alternatively, if the girl's behavior was genuinely harmful, the author's action could be seen as necessary. It's a bit of a toss-up, but since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A because the response was confrontational and could have been handled better. But some might argue B because the girl was being hurtful. Hmm. Need to consider both perspectives.\n"
