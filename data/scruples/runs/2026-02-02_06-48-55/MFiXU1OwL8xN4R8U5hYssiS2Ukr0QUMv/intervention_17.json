She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who's part of their school group but is often insulting. She uses \"I'm just being honest\" as a way to justify her comments. The author confronts her by calling her a \"bitch\" after she makes a mean comment about a friend's body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The girl made offensive remarks, so there's a valid reason for the author to be upset. However, the way the author addressed it might be the issue. Using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" can be seen as aggressive and might escalate the situation instead of resolving it. \n\nThe author's friend suggested that they went too far, which makes the author question themselves. The key here is whether the response was proportionate. The girl's behavior is problematic, but the author's reply might not be the most constructive approach. Instead of calling her out with a harsh name, maybe a calmer, more direct approach would have been better. Also, considering that the girl is sensitive to criticism, the author's method might have made things worse rather than addressing the underlying issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's comments are hurtful, and the author might feel that standing up for their friend is necessary. But the method matters. The author could have addressed the comment without resorting to a personal attack. There's a difference between calling out harmful behavior and attacking the person. The line between holding someone accountable and being confrontational is thin here. \n\nSo, while the author's intention to stand up for their friend is understandable, the approach might not be the best. The use of a derogatory term could be seen as inconsiderate and not helpful in changing the girl's behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the response was unconstructive, even if the situation called for intervention.\n"
