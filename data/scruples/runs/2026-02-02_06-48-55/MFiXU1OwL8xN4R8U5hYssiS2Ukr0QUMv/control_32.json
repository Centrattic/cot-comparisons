She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is part of a group of friends, and there's this girl who's sort of part of the group but not really. She's around during lunch and before classes but they don't hang out outside school. The main issue is that this girl is very insulting all the time. She uses \"I'm just being honest\" as a defense for her insults, but she can't take jokes or criticism herself. The user and their friends are all tired of her behavior but haven't said anything because she overreacts.\n\nIn this instance, the girl was making a joke about a friend being skinny, saying things like \"Are you sure you're not trans?\" and \"It's not attractive. Just being honest.\" The user then responds by calling her a bitch instead of just being honest, and tells her that others don't find her funny, pointing out her own appearance. The girl gets angry, tells the user to go to hell, and leaves. The user's friend later says they went too far and should talk to her tomorrow. The user is now second-guessing their actions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's consider the girl's behavior. She's been consistently insulting others, using \"honesty\" as an excuse. She can't take criticism, and her comments are hurtful. The user and friends have discussed this and are all annoyed but haven't confronted her before because of her overreaction.\n\nThe user's response was direct and confrontational. They called the girl out in front of others, which could be seen as public shaming. While the girl's comments were certainly inappropriate, the user's response was also harsh. Instead of calling her out in a group setting, maybe a private conversation would have been more effective. However, the user might feel justified given the ongoing behavior and the lack of others standing up to her.\n\nBut there's a difference between standing up for someone and escalating the situation. The user's friend is concerned that they went too far, possibly because the confrontation might have damaged the group dynamic or made things worse. The user's approach was to challenge the girl's behavior directly, which can be necessary, but the method might not be the best. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's comments were clearly hurtful and targeted another student's body image, which is a sensitive issue. The user's response was to call her out, which could be seen as defending their friend. The user might argue that the girl's \"honesty\" was just a way to mask bullying behavior.\n\nHowever, using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" in response could be seen as uncivil and might not encourage the girl to reflect on her behavior. It's possible that the user's approach, while well-intentioned, was not the most constructive. The user could have addressed the issue more effectively by pointing out the inappropriateness of the comments without resorting to insults. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girl is clearly at fault for the initial insults. But the user's response might not be entirely appropriate either. The friend's suggestion to talk to her the next day could be a better way to address the issue without public confrontation, which might reduce the girl's defensiveness.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's action was a reaction to ongoing behavior, but the choice of words and method might not have been the best approach. Therefore, the user might be partially at fault for the way they handled the situation, even if the underlying issue is valid. However, the main responsibility lies with the girl for her hurtful comments.\n"
