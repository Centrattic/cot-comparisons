She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by calling a girl a \"bitch\" when she was being insulting and defensive. \n\nFirst, the context: The girl is part of their friend group but not really close. She's known for being mean, making insults, and then justifying it as \"just being honest.\" She can't take criticism and gets defensive. The author was fed up when she mocked a friend for being skinny, using transphobic comments and then saying it's not attractive. The author confronts her by saying she's a bitch, leading to her getting angry and leaving. The friend thinks the author went too far.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The girl's behavior is problematic\u2014bullying, making hurtful comments, and using transphobic remarks. The author called her out for it. But the method used was direct and confrontational. The question is whether that response was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against bullying and defending a friend. The girl's comments are harmful, especially the transphobic ones, which are not just jokes. The author might feel justified in confronting her. \n\nOn the other hand, calling someone a \"bitch\" is a personal attack. Even if the girl's behavior is bad, the author's response was aggressive and could be seen as escalating the situation. The author could have addressed the issue without using a derogatory term, maybe by pointing out the inappropriateness of her comments without attacking her personally. Also, the friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a more constructive approach might have been better.\n\nThe key factors here are the content of the girl's comments (transphobic, hurtful) and the author's response (personal insult). While the intent was to stop the bullying, the method might have been counterproductive. The author's friend's reaction indicates that the approach was too harsh, possibly leading to further conflict without resolution. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment based on the approach. The author's message was valid\u2014that the girl's behavior is not just honesty but meanness\u2014but the delivery could have been more effective. So, the author might be partially in the wrong for the method used, but the intent isn't. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the response's nature, it's leaning towards A (Yes).\n"
