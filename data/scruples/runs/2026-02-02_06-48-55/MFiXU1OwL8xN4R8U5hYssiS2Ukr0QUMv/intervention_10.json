She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling a girl a bitch after she made an insulting comment. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the girl in question is part of the group but not really close friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"honesty\" as an excuse. The author's friend was teased about being skinny, and the girl made a trans-insensitive comment. The author then responds by calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. On one hand, the girl's comments were hurtful and likely harmful, especially the trans remark. The author's retort was direct but maybe harsh. On the other hand, using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" can be seen as aggressive and might escalate the situation. The author could have chosen a different approach, like calmly pointing out the insensitivity without the insult. Also, the friend who told the author to talk to her the next day suggests that a more constructive approach might have been better. But considering the context of ongoing behavior and the specific hurtful comment, the author might feel justified. However, using a slur, even in response to a slur, can be counterproductive. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they used a harsh insult instead of addressing the issue calmly, which could have resolved it without further conflict.\n"
