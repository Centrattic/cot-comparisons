She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for calling a girl a bitch when she was being mean. The girl in question is part of their group but not really friends. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author snapped when she mocked a friend's appearance, calling her a bitch and telling her to look at herself. The friend then said the author went too far.\n\nHmm. The girl's behavior is definitely negative\u2014constantly putting others down. But the author's response was aggressive. Even if the girl is being a jerk, responding with \"you're a bitch\" might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author is defending their friend, which is understandable, but the method could be seen as escalating the situation rather than resolving it. Also, the author's friend is upset, suggesting that maybe the way it was handled wasn't ideal. The girl also didn't take criticism well, so maybe a different approach, like a calm conversation, could have been better. However, the girl's comments were hurtful, so the author's frustration is valid. It's a tricky balance between standing up for others and handling conflict constructively. I think the key here is that while the girl's behavior is wrong, the author's response might have been too harsh, leading to the situation. So probably the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle it in a more constructive way. Answer A.\n"
