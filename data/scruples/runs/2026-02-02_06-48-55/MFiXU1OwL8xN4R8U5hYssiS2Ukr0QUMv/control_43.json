She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that a girl in their friend group is constantly being insulting and says she's \"just being honest,\" but she can't take jokes herself. The author confronts her after she makes a comment about a friend's body, calling her a \"bitch\" and pointing out her hypocrisy.\n\nFirst, the girl's behavior is a problem. She's constantly putting others down and not taking responsibility, just dismissing it as honesty. That's not okay. The author and their friends are clearly frustrated, and maybe the author felt it was time to put a stop to it. But when the author called her a \"bitch,\" that might have been a harsh response. Even though the girl's comments were hurtful, name-calling might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation and make communication harder. The friend who told the author to try talking to her tomorrow might be right\u2014maybe a more constructive approach would have been better to address the behavior without attacking her personally. Also, the author might not have considered the girl's perspective or the potential consequences of a public confrontation. So while the girl's behavior is definitely wrong, the author's response might not be the most effective or respectful way to handle it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach even if the intention was good.\n"
