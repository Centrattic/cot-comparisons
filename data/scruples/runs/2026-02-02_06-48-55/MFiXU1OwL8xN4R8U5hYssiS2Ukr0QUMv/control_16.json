She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after calling a girl a \"bitch\" for being insulting. The situation involves a girl who's part of the group but is very negative, using \"just being honest\" as an excuse for her comments. The author confronts her after she mocks a friend's appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is known for being insulting and doesn't take criticism well. The author's friends are also fed up but haven't spoken up. The trigger here is the girl making a joke about a friend's body, which is a sensitive topic. The author responds with \"you're being a bitch,\" which is harsh but maybe justified given the girl's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, calling someone a \"bitch\" is a strong and potentially hurtful term. It's a direct confrontation, and in public (like lunch), it could escalate tensions. The friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a more measured approach might have been better to avoid public shaming. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's behavior has been ongoing and hurtful. The author might have acted to defend their friend and others who are also tired of her. However, using a derogatory term might not be the most effective way to address the issue. It could lead to her becoming more defensive or hostile, making future interactions worse. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the girl's own inability to take criticism. If she's prone to overreacting, the author's direct approach might not have been the best solution. Maybe a private conversation or reporting the behavior to someone in authority could be more constructive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author had a valid reason to be upset, but the method of response might have been too aggressive. The key points are intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop harmful behavior, but the impact was a public confrontation that might not resolve the underlying issue. \n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up for their friend, the approach might have been unwise. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because using a derogatory term, even in response to negativity, isn't the healthiest way to handle the situation. However, some might argue B if they believe it's justified given the girl's behavior. But the consensus often leans towards A because of the potential for escalation and the lack of constructive resolution.\n"
