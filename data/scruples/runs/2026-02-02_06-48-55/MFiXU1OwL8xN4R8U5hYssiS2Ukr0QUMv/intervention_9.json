She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she made a hurtful comment.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girl is part of the group but not a close friend. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author confronts her when she mocks a friend's body, calling her a bitch. The friend says the author went too far, and the girl got angry and left.\n\nSo, the key points here are the girl's behavior. She's consistently insulting others, using honesty as a shield. The author feels justified because the girl's comments are hurtful and not in good faith. But the friend thinks the author overreacted. \n\nThe question is about right or wrong. In school settings, especially with peers, how we handle conflicts matters. The author's response was direct and confrontational. While the girl's behavior is problematic, publicly calling someone a \"bitch\" might not be the best approach. It's a harsh term and could escalate tensions. The author might have been trying to stand up for their friend, but the method could be seen as aggressive rather than constructive. \n\nAlso, considering the girl's history of being sensitive to criticism, the author's approach might have made things worse. Instead of a public confrontation, maybe a private conversation would be more effective. However, the author did point out the girl's inconsistency in taking jokes and her own appearance, which could be a valid response to her hypocrisy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's comments about body image are harmful and not appropriate. The author's reaction might be a form of defending their friend. But using a derogatory term can be counterproductive. It's possible that the author is right in wanting to stop the bullying but wrong in the method used.\n\nSo, the balance here is between addressing harmful behavior and using respectful communication. The author's intention was good, but the approach might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for the harsh response, even though the initial issue with the girl's behavior is valid.\n"
