She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who told the girl she's not just being honest but a bitch is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who's been making hurtful comments under the guise of honesty, and the author snaps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is part of the group but not close friends. She's known for being insulting and not taking jokes well. This time, she mocked a friend for being skinny, using transphobic remarks, and then claimed she was just being honest. The author responds by calling her a bitch, pointing out that others find her unfunny, and telling her to look at herself. The friend thinks the author went too far, but others might see it as standing up to bullying.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, calling someone a bitch is harsh, but the girl had a history of being hurtful. The author's intent was to confront the bullying behavior. However, the method might be aggressive. The question is whether the response was justified. Some might say that the author had the right to defend their friend, especially if the girl's behavior is harmful. Others might argue that the author should have handled it more respectfully to avoid escalation. The key factors are the girl's prior behavior and the impact of the author's response. The author didn't attack her physically or use more egregious language, but the term \"bitch\" is still a strong insult. However, given the context of ongoing negativity from the girl, some might side with the author. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they confronted harmful behavior, even if the approach was blunt.\n"
