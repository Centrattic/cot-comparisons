She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch when she was being insulting. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: the girl is part of the group but not really friends. She's constantly insulting others and says she's \"just being honest,\" but she can't take jokes herself. The author's friend was mocked for being skinny, and the author snapped by calling the girl a bitch. The friend then got upset and left. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, the main issues here are conflict resolution and proportionality. The girl's behavior is clearly hurtful and not taken constructively. However, the author's response was direct and confrontational. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, they used a derogatory term, which might have escalated the situation. The author's friend thought they went too far, and others didn't intervene, which could suggest the response was harsher than necessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, using a slur like \"bitch\" is generally not an effective way to address someone's behavior. It's more of an attack rather than a constructive criticism. The author could have chosen a different approach, like pointing out the insensitivity without personal insults. The girl's behavior was bad, but the author's method of confrontation might have been inappropriate. So, while the girl's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as contributing to the conflict rather than resolving it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more calmly and respectfully.\n"
