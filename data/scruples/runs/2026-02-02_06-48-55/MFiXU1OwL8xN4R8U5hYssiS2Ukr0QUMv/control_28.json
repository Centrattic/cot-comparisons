She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling a girl a bitch when she was being hurtful. The situation is that this girl is part of their group but is very insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author had enough when she mocked a friend for being skinny and responded by calling her a bitch and telling her to look at herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl's behavior is clearly hurtful and she's been a problem for a while. The author's friends are also tired of her but haven't confronted her before. The author's response was direct and called out her behavior. But the friend is now saying the author went too far.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, public confrontation can be tricky. The girl's comments were mean, especially targeting someone's body. The author's response was to point out that she's not being honest but cruel. However, using a term like \"bitch\" might be seen as a personal attack rather than addressing the behavior. Also, the author then told her to look at herself, which could be seen as throwing shade but might escalate things.\n\nOn one hand, it's valid to stand up against bullying. On the other hand, the method used might not have been the most constructive. The friend is concerned because it could lead to more conflict. The girl did walk out, which might indicate she felt attacked. The author's friends are now split, so there's a social consequence.\n\nSo, the author has a point in defending their friend, but the approach could have been better. Maybe a calmer, more constructive response would have been better. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up for their friend, but the way they did it might have been harsh. The answer might be a bit of both, but since the options are A or B, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The answer likely is B (not in the wrong) because they were defending a friend from a harmful comment, but the method was questionable. But maybe A because the response could have been more respectful. Hmm.\n"
