She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a bitch after she made a joke about a friend's body. The scenario involves a girl who is part of the group but not close friends, known for being insulting and not taking jokes well.\n\nFirst, the girl made a comment about a friend's thinness, implying they might be trans or anorexic, and called it just being honest. The author responds by calling her a bitch and tells her to look at herself. The friend got mad and left, and the author's friend thinks they went too far.\n\nNow, considering the context: the girl has a history of being insulting and doesn't take criticism well. The author's friends were also tired of her. The author's response was direct and confrontational. But the question is whether that response was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the girl's past behavior and the author's response. The author was defending a friend from hurtful comments. However, the way they responded was aggressive, using a harsh word and making a personal attack. Even if the girl deserved it, the author's method might have been inappropriate, especially in a public setting like lunch. The friend's reaction to being called a bitch and storming off might have been expected. The author's friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a more constructive approach might have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl was making hurtful comments under the guise of honesty, which the author rightly called out. But the author's response could be seen as escalating the situation rather than de-escalating it. The line between defending a friend and being confrontational is thin here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, calling someone a bitch in a public setting, even if they're being hurtful, might not be the best approach. It can lead to more conflict and might not address the root issue. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were standing up for a friend, but the method could be questioned. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the response was proportionate. The author's intent was to stop the hurtful comments, but the method chosen was aggressive and might have made things worse. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a calmer discussion might have been better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the situation was frustrating.\n"
