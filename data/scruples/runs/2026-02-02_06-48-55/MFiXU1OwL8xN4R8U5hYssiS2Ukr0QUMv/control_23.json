She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is at fault for calling the girl a bitch after she made a comment about their friend. The context is that the girl often insults others, uses the excuse of being \"just being honest,\" and doesn't take criticism well. The author snapped, called her out, and the friend is now saying they went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl is part of the group but not really close friends. She's known for being insulting and making others uncomfortable. The example given is about body-shaming a friend. The author responded directly and confrontationally, which led to the girl leaving. \n\nThe key points are: Was the author's response appropriate? The girl's behavior was hurtful, but does calling someone a \"bitch\" in return make the author wrong? Also, the author's friend thinks they overreacted. So, maybe the friend is concerned about the author's approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, standing up against body-shaming is important, and the girl's comments were clearly harmful. The author might have been protecting their friend. However, the way they responded\u2014calling her a bitch and making a public confrontation\u2014could be seen as aggressive. The girl might feel attacked, even if the author's intention was to stop the insults. \n\nBut the girl's pattern of behavior is a factor. If she's consistently toxic and the group has discussed it, maybe the author's outburst was a justified reaction to ongoing issues. However, responding with a derogatory term might not be the most effective way to address the problem. It could escalate tensions and make others uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, the friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a more constructive approach might be better. The author's response might have been cathartic but perhaps not the healthiest solution. It's possible that the author had a right to be upset but handled it poorly. \n\nSo, considering all that, there's a balance between defending against bullying and using appropriate methods. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for speaking up, but their method could be questionable. The answer depends on whether the response was proportionate and constructive. Since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and the response was harsh, maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the girl's behavior was bad enough, the author's reaction could be seen as justified, leading to B (No). \n\nHmm, the user wants a clear A or B. The problem is whether the author was wrong in their approach. The phrase \"just being honest\" is often used as an excuse for being mean. The author's response was direct but using a swear word. In some contexts, that's acceptable, but in others, it's not. Since the group already finds her annoying and she's unresponsive to polite criticism, the author's outburst might be a valid reaction. But public confrontation can have repercussions. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. If the group is supportive, maybe the friend is just concerned. But if others are silent, it might indicate that the author's method wasn't the best. I think the answer is A because the author used a harsh insult, which is unprofessional and could be seen as rude. Even if the girl deserved it, the way to handle it might be more about addressing the behavior rather than attacking her character. So AITA is more likely to be A.\n"
