She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. They told a girl she's not just being honest but a bitch after she made insulting comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl in question is part of the group but not close friends. She's known for being insulting and making jokes that others find hurtful. She claims to be \"just being honest,\" but she can't take criticism herself. The author was fed up and snapped back when she mocked a friend for being skinny, calling her a bitch and pointing out her own flaws. The friend says the author went too far, but the author feels justified.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The girl was making hurtful comments, which is bullying behavior. The author confronted her, which could be seen as standing up against bullying. However, the way they did it was confrontational and possibly aggressive. Calling someone a bitch in public might escalate the situation and could be seen as a harsh response. Even though the girl was being a jerk, the author's response might not be the best approach. It's important to consider if a more constructive approach, like calmly addressing the behavior, would have been better. But since the girl has a history of not taking criticism, maybe a direct approach was necessary. However, public shaming and insults can lead to more conflict and might not solve the underlying issue. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a more private and calm discussion might have been better. So, while the author's intent was to stop hurtful behavior, their method might be in the wrong because of the aggressive response.\n"
