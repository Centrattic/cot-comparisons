She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for calling a girl a \"bitch\" after she made insulting comments. The girl in question is part of their friend group but not close. She's known for being insulting and uses \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The AITA confronted her after she mocked another friend's weight, leading to the girl getting upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was appropriate. The girl's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014constantly being insulting and not taking jokes. The author's friends are also annoyed but haven't acted. The author felt it was time to confront her. \n\nCalling someone a \"bitch\" is pretty harsh, even if the person being addressed has been rude. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The girl made a hurtful joke about another friend's body, which is a sensitive topic. The author's retort, while direct, might have been a justified reaction to defend their friend. However, using a derogatory term can escalate things and might not be the best approach for a constructive conversation. \n\nAlso, the friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that the author's approach might have been too confrontational. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, like calmly addressing the issue without the insult. The author's action might have made things more awkward, but considering the girl's history of not taking criticism well, a direct approach could have been necessary. \n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to stand up for their friend. On the other, the method used might not have been the most effective. The label \"in the wrong\" here depends on whether the response was proportionate and if it contributed to a resolution. Since the girl left and the situation became more awkward, maybe the author could have handled it differently. But given the girl's history, the author wasn't entirely wrong to speak up. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the method was harsh, but there's a valid reason too. Hmm.\n"
