She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a girl who's part of their group but isn't really close friends. She's known for being insulting all the time and says she's just being honest. The author had enough when she made a joke about a skinny friend possibly being trans or anorexic, and called her a bitch. The friend is now saying it was too far, but others aren't speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is rude, and the author couldn't take her anymore. But did the response go too far? The author directly called her a bitch, which is pretty harsh. The girl said it was a joke, but the author pointed out that no one found it funny and even compared it to the girl's own appearance.\n\nOn one hand, standing up against bullying is important. If the girl is being mean and others are too afraid to say something, maybe the author did the right thing. But on the other hand, responding with a personal attack (\"take a look at yourself\") might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation or make it more hostile. Also, using a term like \"bitch\" might be seen as rude, even if the intent was to stop the bullying. The author could have addressed the comment without being as confrontational. Maybe pointing out the insensitivity without name-calling would have been more effective. The friend's advice to talk to her tomorrow suggests that a calmer approach might have been better. So, while the girl's behavior was bad, the author's response might not have been the most constructive way to handle it. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they used a confrontational method that could have made things worse instead of addressing the issue more calmly.\n"
