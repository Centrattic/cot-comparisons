She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the girl a \"bitch\" when she was being insulting. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The girl is part of the group but not really a close friend. She's known for being insulting and using \"just being honest\" as a defense. The author heard her making a comment about a friend's body, which is clearly hurtful. The author responds by calling her a bitch and pointing out her hypocrisy. The friend then says the author went too far.\n\nSo, the main points here are the girl's behavior, the author's response, and the consequences. The girl is consistently insulting others, which is problematic. The author's response was direct and confrontational, which could be seen as defending their friend.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, using a harsh term like \"bitch\" is aggressive. Even if the girl was being mean, the author could have addressed the comment in a different way, maybe by pointing out the hurtfulness without the personal attack. However, the girl's behavior was hurtful, and the author might have felt justified in calling her out, especially if others were uncomfortable speaking up.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. The author's response might have escalated the situation, leading to the girl leaving, which could be seen as making things worse. On the other hand, the author was standing up against bullying, which is commendable. The key here is whether the response was proportionate. The girl was repeatedly insulting others, so the author's reaction might be a form of self-defense or defending others. However, using a derogatory term might not be the best approach, even if the intent was good.\n\nIn many cases, communication strategies that are non-confrontational are more effective. But in a school setting where peer pressure exists, the author might have felt that a direct response was necessary. It's a tricky situation. The answer depends on whether the author's response was appropriate given the context. If the girl had a history of being hurtful and the author was trying to protect their friend, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the response was overly harsh, then perhaps they are. The line between standing up for someone and being confrontational is thin here. I think the author's intent was to stop the bullying, but the method could be questioned. So, maybe the answer is a mix, but the question asks for A or B. Considering the options, I lean towards B (author not in the wrong) because they were defending someone else from hurtful comments, even though the approach could be improved. But others might argue it's A because of the harsh language. Hmm.\n"
