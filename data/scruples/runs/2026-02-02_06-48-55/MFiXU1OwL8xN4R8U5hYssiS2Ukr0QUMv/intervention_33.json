She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl in their friend group who's known for being insulting but says she's just being honest. The author confronts her for making a joke about a friend's body, calling her a \"bitch\" instead of just being honest. Then the friend says the author went too far.\n\nSo, the main points here are the girl's behavior versus the author's response. The girl is constantly making hurtful comments, using \"just being honest\" as an excuse. The author, after multiple instances of this, finally calls her out in a direct and harsh way. The friend is upset because the author might have escalated the situation.\n\nNow, should the author be in the wrong? Well, the girl's behavior is definitely problematic. Insulting others and not taking criticism well is not okay. However, the author's response involved calling her a \"bitch,\" which is a strong insult. Even if the girl deserves it, using such a term might not be the best approach. It can come off as aggressive and might not lead to a constructive resolution. The author's friend suggested talking to her tomorrow, which implies a more calm approach could have been better. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girl's actions were hurtful, and the author was defending their friend. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the girl's behavior is constant. However, the immediate reaction of name-calling might not be the most effective way to address the issue. It could lead to more conflict, as seen when the girl got mad and left. The author might have been right in wanting to stop the girl's behavior but used the wrong method. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The girl's behavior is bad, but the author's method of confrontation could be improved. So, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the harsh response. But if the question is about whether they're in the wrong for the action taken, then yes, they might be. The friend's advice to talk to her the next day suggests that a more measured approach is better. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because the response was too harsh, even if the intent was good.\n"
