The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go on a trip with a girl who's in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with his girlfriend Amy.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is in a relationship with Amy, and he's been planning a trip with his friend Melissa, who's been friends with him for three years. They initially planned the trip with a group, but then it turned into just the two of them because others couldn't agree. Amy was okay with it, trusting they're just friends. But then, Melissa made a move, confessing her feelings and trying to kiss him. He told Amy, and now Amy is upset about the trip. The author thinks it's just about money, but Amy is worried about inappropriateness even if he's faithful.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is considering going on a trip alone with a girl who has feelings for him, which could create a situation where things get complicated. Even if he's not cheating, being alone with someone who's attracted to him might lead to emotional strain or potential issues, even if they're just friends. The girlfriend is uncomfortable with the idea, which is a valid concern. Trust is a big part of relationships, and the girlfriend's trust is being tested here. \n\nEven if the author feels he can be appropriate, the situation itself is potentially problematic. By going on the trip, he's putting himself in a scenario where it's just him and Melissa, which could lead to misunderstandings, pressure from Melissa, or emotional turmoil. The girlfriend's reaction shows that she feels it's inappropriate regardless of his intentions. The author's argument about money seems like a secondary concern compared to the emotional and relational impact.\n\nIn relationships, respecting the partner's feelings and boundaries is crucial. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable, the right move would be to avoid the situation, even if it's inconvenient. The author's insistence on going despite her concerns might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. So, even if there's no cheating, the act of choosing to go on the trip alone with someone else's crush could be considered wrong because it's potentially harmful to the relationship's trust and emotional safety.\n"
