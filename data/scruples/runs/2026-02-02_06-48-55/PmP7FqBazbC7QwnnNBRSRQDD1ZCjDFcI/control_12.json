The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a friend Melissa. They were supposed to go on a trip together, but Melissa is now in love with him. Amy is upset because the trip is just the two of them, and the author is considering going anyway because of the money. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the key issues are. The main points are the existing relationship with Amy, the trip plans with Melissa, the fact that Melissa has feelings and made a move, and the author's reasoning about money and trust.\n\nThe author is married to Amy, so the trip with Melissa could be seen as a potential issue for the relationship. Even if they are just friends, being alone on a trip with someone who has romantic feelings might create problems. The author initially didn't invite Amy because Melissa thought it was too soon, but now Melissa has confessed her feelings. \n\nThe author is saying it's just about the money, but Amy is worried about the inappropriateness. Even if the author intends to be appropriate, the situation could be risky. Trust is important in a relationship, and maybe the author is underestimating how Amy feels. The trip could be a strain on their relationship regardless of what happens. \n\nAlso, Melissa's actions\u2014trying to kiss him and saying it's \"our time\"\u2014might mean she's not respecting the author's relationship. The author might be in a situation where going on the trip could be seen as giving Melissa the wrong impression or not respecting Amy's feelings. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, even if the author doesn't cheat, the trip could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The fact that Melissa is in love with him complicates things. The author might be putting his financial interests over his partner's emotional well-being. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author believes that the trip is not a problem because he's faithful. However, the perception is important here. Amy's trust is being tested, and the author is choosing to go despite her concerns. That could be a mistake. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because going on the trip despite the girlfriend's concerns and the friend's romantic feelings is risky and could harm the relationship. Even if nothing happens, the trip might be seen as a breach of trust. So the answer is A.\n"
