The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author is in a relationship with Amy for 9 months. They have a friend, Melissa, who's been a friend for three years. They planned a trip to Hawaii with a group of college friends, but it ended up being just the two of them because no one else wanted to commit. The author didn't invite Amy because Melissa thought it was a bad idea to plan a long trip with someone new. Amy was initially uncomfortable with Melissa and the author sharing a room but was okay after being assured they were just friends.\n\nThen, at a party at Melissa's house, after everyone else left, Melissa tells the author she's in love with him and that the trip is \"our time.\" She tries to kiss him, and the author leaves. Now, Amy finds out and is upset. The author says it's only about money and the non-refundable deposits, but Amy is concerned it's inappropriate. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for going on the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship aspect. The author is in a monogamous relationship with Amy. Melissa's feelings were unexpected, but the author knew she was a close friend. The initial plan was a group trip, which turned into a two-person trip. The author's girlfriend was not invited because Melissa thought it wasn't a good idea. Now that Melissa has made her feelings known, the situation is problematic.\n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries in a relationship. Even if the author doesn't plan to act on any inappropriate behavior, the trip itself could be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend feels it's inappropriate, and the author is now in a position where they might be spending extended time alone with an ex-friend who has romantic feelings. \n\nThe author's argument is that the money is non-refundable and they wouldn't do anything inappropriate. But relationships often involve compromising on comfort and trust. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable, even if the author doesn't think they're in the wrong, the act of going on the trip might be seen as ignoring the girlfriend's feelings and potentially putting themselves in a situation where things could escalate, even unintentionally.\n\nAlso, the fact that Melissa initiated the romantic overture after a party where they were alone might suggest she's in a vulnerable state. The author's decision to go on the trip despite the girlfriend's concerns could be seen as not prioritizing the relationship's trust. Even if the author is confident in their own actions, the girlfriend's trust is crucial. If the author proceeds, it might lead to more conflict or hurt feelings, which could damage the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they've been in a relationship for 9 months and that Melissa is a friend who now has feelings they didn't expect. The financial aspect is a real issue, but the emotional impact on the relationship could be more significant. The author's insistence that it's just about the money might not fully address the girlfriend's emotional concerns.\n\nIn many cases, relationships require partners to make compromises. If the girlfriend is genuinely uncomfortable, even if the author feels it's unnecessary, the right move might be to cancel the trip to respect her feelings. Proceeding could be seen as prioritizing the financial loss over the relationship's well-being, which might make the author at fault for not considering their partner's perspective adequately.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in a situation where their actions, even if well-intentioned, are causing distress in their relationship. The trip with Melissa, especially after her confession, is likely seen as inappropriate by their partner. The author's insistence on going despite the partner's feelings could be considered wrong because it disregards the partner's trust and comfort, which are essential in a healthy relationship.\n"
