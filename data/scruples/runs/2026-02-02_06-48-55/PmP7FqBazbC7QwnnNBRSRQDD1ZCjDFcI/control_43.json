The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author, let's call him John, has a girlfriend named Amy. They've been dating for 9 months. There's a friend named Melissa, who he's known for 3 years. Melissa was coordinating a trip for their college friends to Hawaii. She convinced John to go with her because the others couldn't agree on dates. Amy was uncomfortable at first when she heard they'd be sharing a room, but after John assured her they're just friends, she was okay.\n\nThen, during a party at Melissa's house, after others left, Melissa confesses she's been in love with John for three years and tries to kiss him. John leaves, and when he tells Amy, she's upset and wants the trip canceled. John says it's about the money because he already paid, and he trusts he can stay appropriate. Amy is worried about the trip being inappropriate even if he doesn't cheat.\n\nSo, the question is whether John is in the wrong for going on the trip with Melissa despite her feelings and Amy's concerns.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. John is in a relationship with Amy, and he's planning a trip with a friend who is now in love with him. Melissa's feelings create a potential for emotional or physical infidelity. Even if John doesn't have the intent to cheat, the situation is high-risk. Amy is uncomfortable because of her trust in John but also the inherent risk of being in a secluded trip with someone who has romantic feelings for him.\n\nJohn argues that it's about the money, but Amy seems to feel there's more to it. The fact that Melissa is trying to make the trip about their \"time\" could be a red flag. Even if John is trustworthy, being in a situation where the other person is romantically interested could lead to pressure or misinterpretations. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, partners often expect their significant others to avoid situations that could potentially lead to conflict or infidelity, regardless of the person's intentions. The trip being alone with Melissa might be seen as disregarding Amy's feelings and the boundaries necessary for trust. Even if there's no physical cheating, emotional boundaries are important. \n\nAlso, Melissa's confession is recent, and her behavior during the trip could be unpredictable. John's assurance that he can stay appropriate might not account for Melissa's actions or the stress of the situation. The fact that Amy is upset shows that communication is an issue here. John might need to consider Amy's perspective more and whether the trip is worth the potential damage to their relationship, even if financially he's at a loss.\n\nOn the other hand, John might feel that he's not doing anything wrong since there's no actual infidelity. But relationships often require more than just avoiding explicit cheating; they require maintaining each other's trust and comfort. If Amy feels that the trip is inappropriate, then proceeding could be seen as ignoring her feelings and the potential risks, which can erode trust over time.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it seems like John is in a position where he's choosing to proceed with a trip that his girlfriend finds uncomfortable and risky. Even though he might not have malicious intent, the act of going on the trip could be seen as inconsiderate of Amy's feelings and the potential for issues, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
