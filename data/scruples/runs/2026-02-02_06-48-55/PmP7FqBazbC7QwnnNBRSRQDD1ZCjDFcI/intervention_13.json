The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with Melissa, who is his girlfriend's friend and secretly in love with him.\n\nFirst, the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and has been with her for 9 months. Melissa is a friend of three years. The trip was initially supposed to be with the college group, but it scaled down to just them two. The author didn't invite Amy because Melissa suggested it might not be a good idea with someone new. Amy was okay with them sharing a room as friends. \n\nThen, Melissa confesses her feelings and tries to kiss him. The author tells Amy, and they argue about whether the trip should still happen. The author argues it's about money, while Amy feels it's inappropriate despite trusting him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a relationship and plans a trip alone with a friend who has feelings for him. Even if they don't plan for anything to happen, the potential for misunderstanding or temptation exists. Amy's discomfort is valid because being alone with someone else, especially with a history of being close and a romantic interest, can be seen as crossing boundaries in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't cheating and has no intention of it. He's being honest about his feelings and the situation. The financial aspect is a real concern, and he's trying to be responsible. He also communicates with Amy, which shows he's trying to be transparent.\n\nBut relationships often require considering the partner's feelings and comfort levels beyond what's strictly necessary. Even if the author isn't doing anything wrong by his own standards, Amy's trust might be undermined by the situation. The key issue here is whether the trip creates an environment where it's easy for things to escalate, even if they don't plan for it. \n\nIn many relationship contexts, being alone with someone else can be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intentions. The fact that Melissa confessed her feelings adds another layer of complexity. The author might be putting his relationship at risk by choosing financial prudence over his girlfriend's emotional needs. \n\nSo considering all angles, the author is in the wrong because the situation is inherently risky and could lead to issues even if no immediate harm occurs. Amy's trust and emotional well-being should take precedence over financial considerations in this case.\n"
