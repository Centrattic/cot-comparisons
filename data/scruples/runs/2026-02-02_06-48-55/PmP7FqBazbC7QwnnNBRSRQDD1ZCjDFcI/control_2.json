The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nSo, the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and has been in a 9-month relationship. Then there's Melissa, a friend of three years, who's planning a trip to Hawaii. The author and Melissa originally planned the trip for the whole college group, but the others didn't agree, so it became just the two of them. Amy was uncomfortable with sharing a room but okay after assurances. Then, at a party, Melissa confesses her love and tries to kiss him. He tells Amy, and she's upset that he's going on the trip with Melissa. The author argues it's about money and non-refundable payments. Amy feels it's inappropriate regardless of trust.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the existing relationship with Amy and the trip with Melissa after her confession. The author is in a committed relationship, so going on a trip alone with another person, especially after the other person has expressed romantic feelings, could be problematic. Even if the author intends to be appropriate, the situation itself might be seen as a risk, regardless of intent.\n\nAmy's discomfort is valid. In relationships, trust is important, but being alone with someone who has romantic feelings can lead to complications. The author might think trust should override the situation, but in many relationships, the expectation is to avoid situations that could be misinterpreted or lead to issues, even if the person is trusted.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the money seems to downplay Amy's emotional concerns. While financial loss is a real issue, relationships often require considering emotional well-being over financial aspects unless there's a clear agreement. The author's justification of \"just friends\" might not hold when Melissa has feelings and the trip is a private setting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for proceeding. The answer hinges on whether the trip is inherently wrong despite intentions. Since the trip could be seen as a breach of relationship norms, even if no infidelity occurs, the author might be in the wrong by not prioritizing Amy's feelings and the potential risks involved.\n"
