The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a guy who's in a 9-month relationship with Amy, but he's planning a trip with his friend Melissa, who he's known for three years. The trip was supposed to be with their college friends, but Melissa couldn't get others to commit, so it's just them two. The boyfriend didn't invite his girlfriend initially because Melissa suggested it wasn't a good idea with someone he'd just started dating.\n\nThen, after a party, Melissa confesses her feelings, tries to kiss him, and he leaves. He tells Amy, and she's uncomfortable. He insists on going on the trip anyway because of the money, even though Amy feels it's inappropriate. He says he wouldn't cheat but she's getting mad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship norms. Most people would consider it wrong to go on a trip with an ex or a friend who is in love with you while in a committed relationship. Even if there's no cheating, the trip could cause jealousy and mistrust. The girlfriend has a valid concern about the appropriateness of the situation. The author's reasoning about money seems like a poor excuse. Trust is crucial in relationships, and even if he intends to be faithful, the trip could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nMelissa's feelings complicate things. The fact that she confessed her feelings makes the trip more awkward. Even if the guy isn't interested, the situation could lead to misunderstandings or make the girlfriend feel insecure. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable. The author is prioritizing financial loss over his partner's emotional well-being. \n\nAlso, the author initially didn't bring the girlfriend because Melissa advised against it, but now Melissa has feelings, which adds a new layer. The trip being non-refundable isn't a strong justification. Relationships require compromise, and sometimes financial loss is a small price compared to relational damage.\n\nIn many cases, people advise against situations that could lead to jealousy or mistrust, even if infidelity isn't the immediate risk. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, and the author's insistence on going could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. So, the author is in the wrong because he's choosing to put himself in a situation that's likely to harm his relationship, regardless of his intentions.\n"
