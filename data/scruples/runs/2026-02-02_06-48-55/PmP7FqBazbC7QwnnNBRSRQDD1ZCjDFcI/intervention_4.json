The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with a friend who has romantic feelings for him, while he's in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a close female friend, Melissa, who's in love with him. They initially planned a trip for a group, but it ended up being just the two of them. Amy was uncomfortable but okay with it. Then, Melissa confessed her feelings and tried to kiss him. He told Amy, and now Amy is upset about the trip.\n\nSo, key points: He's in a committed relationship, and the trip was supposed to be with a group but turned into a two-person trip. The fact that Melissa has feelings for him complicates things. Even if the author has no intention of cheating, being alone on a trip with someone who has romantic feelings could create a lot of tension. \n\nFrom Amy's perspective, it's about trust and the potential for things to escalate. Even if the author is loyal, the situation is inherently risky. Being in a romantic relationship usually requires avoiding circumstances that could lead to temptation or misunderstandings. \n\nThe author argues it's about the money, but that might not be a strong enough justification. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If the trip is causing stress and distrust, maybe it's better to cancel and prioritize the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is confident in his self-control and communication, maybe it's manageable. But Melissa's feelings complicate things. Even if he's not interested, her actions were inappropriate, and going on the trip could be seen as encouraging her advances. \n\nSo, even if he doesn't cheat, the act of going on the trip could be considered wrong because it risks the integrity of his relationship. Amy's feelings matter here. Trust is important, but sometimes actions can undermine that trust regardless of intentions. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's putting his relationship at risk by going on a trip with a friend who is in love with him, despite the financial loss. The right thing would be to cancel the trip to avoid any potential issues and show respect for his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
