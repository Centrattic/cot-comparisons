The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with Amy for 9 months. Then there's Melissa, a friend of 3 years, who's also part of a larger friend group. They planned a trip to Hawaii, initially with the group, but it ended up being just the author and Melissa. Amy was okay with that because Melissa is just a friend. But now, Melissa has confessed her feelings and tried to kiss the author, which Amy finds inappropriate. The author argues it's just about the money since they already paid for the trip, but Amy is upset and feels it's wrong to go on a trip alone with someone who's in love with him. \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is the one in a committed relationship, so their actions affect Amy. Even if the author is faithful, the situation itself might be seen as problematic. Melissa's feelings complicate things, and the trip being only the two of them could lead to jealousy or mistrust. The author's girlfriend is concerned about the appropriateness, which is a valid emotion in a relationship. \n\nThe author's argument is about the financial aspect, but Amy's issue isn't just the money. She's worried about the trip being inappropriate. Trust is important, but so is respecting a partner's feelings. Even if the author plans to be appropriate, the trip's setup could be seen as potentially risky. Melissa's actions have already shown that she has strong feelings, which might put the author in a difficult position. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes what's right isn't just about actions but also about how it makes the partner feel. The author might not be cheating, but being on a trip alone with someone who has a crush could strain the relationship. Amy's trust is important, but so is her comfort. The author might be prioritizing financial loss over emotional considerations, which could be seen as not fully respecting Amy's feelings. \n\nSo, even if there's no intention to do harm, the situation is ethically gray. The author should consider cancelling the trip to avoid any potential issues. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for proceeding with the trip despite the girlfriend's objections.\n"
