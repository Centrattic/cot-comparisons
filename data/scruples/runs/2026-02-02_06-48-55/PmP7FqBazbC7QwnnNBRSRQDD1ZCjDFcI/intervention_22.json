The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a close friend Melissa. They planned a trip to Hawaii without Amy because Melissa thought it was a bad idea to plan a trip with someone they'd just started dating. Now, Melissa has confessed her feelings and tried to kiss the author, which made Amy uncomfortable. The author is considering going on the trip despite Amy's objections, mostly because of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. The main issue here is whether it's appropriate for the author to go on a trip alone with another woman while in a relationship. Amy feels it's inappropriate, even if the author believes they can stay friends. The author argues that it's about the money and that he can be trusted, but Amy is upset that he's prioritizing financial loss over her feelings.\n\nRelationships often require mutual trust and respect. While the author may not intend to do anything wrong, the situation is inherently risky. Even if there's no intention to cheat, being alone with someone who has romantic feelings can lead to complications. Amy's trust is important, and her feeling that it's inappropriate suggests that the author's decision could harm their relationship. \n\nAdditionally, the author initially assured Amy that Melissa was just a friend, which might have led to her agreeing with the initial trip plan. Now that Melissa's feelings are known, the dynamic has changed. The author's insistence on going might be seen as dismissive of Amy's valid concerns. Even if the author believes he can handle the situation, the potential for emotional harm to Amy is significant.\n\nFinancial reasons shouldn't be the primary justification for ignoring a partner's feelings. While losing money is a real concern, the emotional cost to the relationship could be higher. The fact that Amy is getting mad and interrogating him indicates that this is a significant issue for her. The author's stance that it's just about the money might not hold up if it's causing more damage to their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is prioritizing his own financial interests over his girlfriend's emotional well-being. Even if there's no cheating involved, the trip could be seen as a betrayal of trust and respect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for choosing to go on the trip despite Amy's clear discomfort and concerns.\n"
