The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user has a girlfriend named Amy, and they've been together for 9 months. Then there's Melissa, a friend of three years, who organized a trip to Hawaii that was originally supposed to be for a group of seven friends. But the group couldn't agree on dates, so it became just the user and Melissa. The user didn't invite Amy because Melissa suggested it might be bad to plan a trip with someone you just started dating. Amy was okay with Melissa sharing a room as long as they were just friends.\n\nThen, at a party, Melissa made it clear she's in love with the user and tried to kiss him. He left, and later told Amy. Now Amy is upset that he's still planning the trip with Melissa, even though he says it's about the money and non-refundable costs. Amy thinks it's inappropriate, but he's arguing that trust should be there.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong if he goes on the trip? Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, infidelity or cheating? The user didn't have sex or even physical contact, but Melissa made a move, which he rejected. So the user hasn't cheated, but the situation is emotionally charged. \n\nSecond, the trip: going on a trip alone with an ex or someone who has feelings for you can be seen as a red flag in a relationship. Even if there's no physical infidelity, the emotional aspect might be a problem. The girlfriend feels uncomfortable and the user is aware of that. \n\nTrust is a big factor here. The user is saying that Amy should trust him, but Amy's discomfort is valid because of Melissa's feelings and the previous situation. Even if the user is faithful, the trip could cause jealousy or mistrust. \n\nAlso, the fact that they had planned it before Melissa expressed feelings complicates things. The user knew Melissa had feelings after the party, yet still wants to go. It could be seen as ignoring Amy's feelings and putting himself in a potentially compromising situation. \n\nFinancial reasons don't absolve the situation. It's about the relationship dynamics. If going on the trip makes Amy uncomfortable and could lead to more issues, even if the user is planning to be appropriate, the act of going might be considered wrong because it disregards Amy's feelings and the potential for problems.\n\nSo, the user is in a position where he's choosing his own convenience over his partner's comfort. Even if there's no physical cheating, the emotional aspect might mean he's in the wrong because he's not prioritizing the relationship's health.\n"
