The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with Melissa, who's in love with him, while he's in a relationship with Amy. \n\nFirst, the basic premise here is that the author is going on a trip alone with a friend who has romantic feelings for him. Even though he claims they're just friends and he's faithful, the situation could be problematic. \n\nAmy is his girlfriend, and trust is a big part of relationships. Even if the author doesn't intend to do anything wrong, the mere fact that he's on a trip alone with someone else who's in love with him might make it hard to maintain boundaries. Melissa's confession and the way she referred to the trip as \"our time\" after three years suggests she's been building up to this, which could create pressure or awkward situations.\n\nThe author argues that he's already paid for the trip and can't get a refund, so it's about the money. However, Amy is concerned about the appropriateness of the situation, not just financially. The key point here is about respect for the girlfriend's feelings and maintaining trust. Even if the author is confident in his own actions, the situation could be seen as disrespectful to Amy's trust and feelings. \n\nAlso, when Amy suggested going somewhere together instead, the author didn't consider that option, which might indicate he's not prioritizing her comfort. Relationships often require compromise, and this seems like a situation where the author is prioritizing his own plans over his girlfriend's emotional well-being. \n\nSo, even if there's no actual infidelity, the act of going on a trip alone with someone who has romantic feelings can be seen as inconsiderate and potentially damaging to the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's placing himself in a situation that could be perceived as a breach of trust, regardless of his intentions.\n"
