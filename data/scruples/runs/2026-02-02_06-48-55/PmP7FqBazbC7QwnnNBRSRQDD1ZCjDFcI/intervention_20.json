The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a guy who's in a 9-month relationship with his girlfriend Amy, but he's planning a trip with his friend Melissa, who he's been friends with for three years. Melissa coordinated the trip for their college friends, but it ended up being just them two. Now, Melissa has confessed her feelings for him, and Amy is upset about the trip.\n\nFirst, the author initially didn't invite his girlfriend to the trip because Melissa suggested it would be a bad idea with someone he just started dating. The author didn't think anything was wrong at first, but then Melissa's confession created tension. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong to still go on the trip with Melissa despite her feelings and Amy's concerns.\n\nI need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. Trust is a big part of relationships. Even if the author doesn't have romantic intentions, the fact that Melissa is in love with him and the trip is a private vacation could be seen as a potential risk. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid because even if the author is faithful, the situation could be perceived as compromising their relationship boundaries. \n\nThe author argues that it's about the money, but maybe there's a lack of consideration for Amy's feelings. Even if financially it's a loss, relationships often require making sacrifices for the partner's comfort. The author's insistence on going despite knowing Melissa's feelings might be seen as dismissive of Amy's trust issues. \n\nAlso, Melissa's actions\u2014telling him it's \"our time\" after years of friendship\u2014might indicate that she sees the trip as a romantic opportunity. The author's decision to proceed could be seen as a test of Amy's trust, which isn't fair. The girlfriend's anger suggests she feels the situation is risky, and the author's reasoning might not address her emotional concerns properly.\n\nSo, based on the potential for misunderstanding and the girlfriend's legitimate concerns, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting her feelings and possibly putting the relationship at risk by going on the trip.\n"
