The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a girlfriend, Amy, and a close friend Melissa who's been in love with them for three years. They planned a trip to Hawaii with a group of friends, but the group didn't agree on dates, so it became a trip with just Melissa. The person didn't invite Amy because Melissa said it wouldn't be a good idea to plan a future trip with someone they just started dating. Amy was okay with them sharing a room as friends, but now Melissa confessed her feelings and tried to kiss them. The person left and told Amy, who is upset about them going on the trip with Melissa.\n\nFirst, the person is in a relationship with Amy. Even if Melissa is a friend and they didn't invite Amy initially for a logical reason (group not agreeing on dates), Melissa's feelings have now changed. The person might not have intended to go on the trip with Melissa after this confession, but the issue is whether going on the trip as planned is still appropriate. \n\nAmy trusts the person, but she's still concerned about the trip. The person argues it's just about the money and not being able to recover the costs. But is that a valid reason? In relationships, sometimes financial factors aren't the most important. The trip is now in a different context after Melissa's confession. It could be seen as leading Melissa on if they go, especially since she's made her feelings clear. Even if they don't have those feelings, continuing with the trip might make Melissa (and maybe Amy) uncomfortable. \n\nThe person's response to Melissa's confession was to leave and not address the trip immediately. Now, they're trying to justify going despite the situation. Melissa's actions changed the dynamic, and the person's commitment is to their girlfriend. While the person says they'll be appropriate, being in a situation where a friend who is in love with them is present might be a conflict. \n\nSo, is it wrong to go on the trip with Melissa after she confessed her feelings and the trip was initially planned without the girlfriend? It's a judgment call. Some might say yes, because even if no infidelity is intended, the trip could be seen as unethical or disrespectful to Amy. Others might say the person is being honest and the trip is just a financial loss. But in a relationship, actions that could be perceived as risky or disrespectful, even if no harm is intended, often lead to negative consequences. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong by not canceling the trip despite Melissa's feelings and Amy's concerns.\n"
