The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is in a 9-month relationship with Amy, and they have a friend Melissa who's been a friend for 3 years. They planned a trip to Hawaii with a group, but when others couldn't make it, it became just Melissa and the author. Amy wasn't invited initially because Melissa thought it wasn't a good idea to plan a trip with someone they'd just started dating. Then, during a party, Melissa confesses her love and tries to kiss him. The author tells Amy about this, and Amy is upset that they're going on the trip with Melissa. The author is conflicted between the money lost if they cancel and Amy's discomfort.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about relationships and trust. The author has a girlfriend, so the main question is whether going on a trip alone with a friend who has feelings for them is appropriate. The girlfriend feels it's inappropriate regardless of the money, while the author thinks it's mainly about the financial loss. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, even if there's no intention to cheat, being alone with someone who is romantically interested in you can create situations that might be risky. The girlfriend's concern is about the potential for things to escalate, even if the author believes they can handle it. The author's defense that the money is a big factor might not be the main issue for the relationship's health. Trust is a two-way street, but the author is putting themself in a situation that the partner finds uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, Melissa initiated the romantic feelings and the kiss, but the author is still choosing to go on the trip with her. It's possible that the author isn't considering how their actions might affect Amy's feelings and trust, even if they don't have malicious intent. In many relationships, avoiding potential conflicts of interest or situations that cause discomfort in the partner is expected. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't cheating, the act of going on a trip alone with an interested friend could be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend's trust is important, and the author's insistence on going despite her concerns might indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here because they are prioritizing their own financial concerns over their partner's emotional well-being and trust.\n"
