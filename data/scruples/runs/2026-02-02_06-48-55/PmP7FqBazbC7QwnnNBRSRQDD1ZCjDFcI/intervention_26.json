The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for going on a trip with their girlfriend's friend who has feelings for them. Let me break down the situation again.\n\nThe author has a girlfriend, Amy, and they've been together for 9 months. There's also a friend named Melissa, who has been a friend for 3 years. They planned a trip with their college friends to Hawaii, but when it turned out to be just the two of them, the author didn't invite Amy because Melissa said it was a bad idea with someone new in the relationship. Amy was uncomfortable at first but okay after being assured it was just friends.\n\nThen, Melissa made a move, confessed her feelings, and tried to kiss the author. The author told her they weren't feeling well and left. When the author explained to Amy, she wanted to cancel the trip, but the author is reluctant because of the money already spent. Now Amy is upset, even though she trusts the author, she still thinks it's inappropriate.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) if they went on the trip. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me think. From a relationship perspective, trust and respect are key. Even if the author believes they can handle the situation and not let things get inappropriate, the fact that Melissa is in love with him and there's a prior incident where she tried to kiss him adds tension. The girlfriend is uncomfortable, even if it's not about mistrust. The trip being just the two of them in a situation where there's potential for conflict (like being alone together for an extended period) could be a recipe for more issues.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the money might not outweigh the emotional impact on Amy. Relationships often require making sacrifices for each other's comfort and trust. Even if there's no cheating, the trip could cause ongoing jealousy or distrust. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here; she might feel neglected or insecure, even if the author is innocent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the money is a loss and that they were already planning the trip. But in relationships, sometimes financial losses are a small price compared to maintaining trust and harmony. The author might also be underestimating how Melissa's feelings could escalate if they are on a trip together, especially after she already made a move once.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author's intentions are good, the situation is inherently problematic. The girlfriend's discomfort is a sign that it's a bad idea. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by deciding to go on the trip despite Amy's concerns. The answer would be A.\n"
