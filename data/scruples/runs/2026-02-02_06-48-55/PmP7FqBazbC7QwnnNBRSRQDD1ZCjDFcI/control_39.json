The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for going on the trip with Melissa despite having a girlfriend, Amy. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 9-month relationship with Amy. They have a friend group, and Melissa, a 3-year friend, was in charge of organizing a trip. Initially, the trip was supposed to be for the whole group but ended up being just the author and Melissa. The author didn't invite Amy because Melissa said it wasn't a good idea with a new relationship. Amy was a bit uncomfortable about sharing a room but okay after being assured they were just friends.\n\nThen, at Melissa's house, after others left, Melissa confesses her feelings, leading to an almost kiss. The author tells Amy, and they argue about whether to cancel the trip. The author says it's about the money and non-refundable costs, but Amy feels it's inappropriate. The author argues that Amy should trust him, but Amy is upset beyond just the money.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's wrong to go on a trip alone with an ex-friend who has romantic feelings, while being in a relationship. The key factors here are the girlfriend's trust, the potential for impropriety, and the author's intentions.\n\nFrom Amy's perspective, even if the author has no intention of cheating, going on a trip alone with someone who is romantically interested in him could be seen as crossing a boundary. Trust is important in a relationship, and the girlfriend might feel uneasy regardless of the author's intentions. The situation could create opportunities for things to escalate, especially with the trip being in a different location and just the two of them. The fact that Melissa made a move after already confessing her feelings adds to the concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the decision is based on financial loss. But relationships often require sacrifices, and maybe the cost of losing trust or causing hurt outweighs the money saved. Also, the initial decision to go on the trip without Amy might have been a mistake, especially after Melissa's confession. The author might be prioritizing his own convenience over Amy's feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even if he doesn't intend to do anything wrong, the situation is inherently risky. The girlfriend has a right to feel insecure, and the author's insistence on going despite her concerns might be dismissive of her valid emotions. The fact that Melissa has romantic feelings and they're alone in a vacation setting increases the potential for issues. So, the author might be in the wrong by not considering how his actions affect Amy's trust and emotional well-being, even if there's no malicious intent.\n"
