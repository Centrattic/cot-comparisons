The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is that he's already in a 9-month relationship with Amy but is planning a trip with Melissa, a friend of 3 years. The trip was supposed to be with the college group, but Melissa ended up coordinating it with just him. Amy was initially okay with them sharing a room as friends, but after Melissa confesses her feelings and tries to kiss him, Amy is upset. The author is considering going on the trip despite this because of the non-refundable costs and feels Amy should trust him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author is in a committed relationship but is going on a trip alone with someone who has feelings for him. Even if he doesn't have feelings for Melissa, the situation is inherently risky. The fact that Melissa has confessed her feelings makes it even more complicated. Amy's discomfort is understandable because the trip was originally meant to be with a group, but it's now just them two. \n\nThe author's argument is that the money is the main issue and that he can remain appropriate. However, being alone in a vacation setting with someone who is interested in you can lead to misunderstandings, even if the person intends to be appropriate. Trust is a big part of relationships, and Amy's trust might not be sufficient here. Also, the initial decision to not include Amy in the trip planning because Melissa thought it was a bad idea when dating someone new might have been a mistake. The author didn't consider Amy's feelings enough from the start. \n\nIn relationships, especially early on, transparency and communication are key. The author didn't involve Amy in the planning from the beginning, which might have prevented this conflict. Now, going on the trip with Melissa despite her confession could be seen as dismissive of Amy's feelings and the risks involved. Even if the author isn't cheating, the mere presence in such a situation can cause jealousy and insecurity. \n\nSo, even if the author has good intentions, the situation is problematic. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's putting himself in a potentially compromising position despite knowing Melissa's feelings and his partner's concerns. The financial aspect shouldn't override emotional and relational considerations. Trust is crucial, and by not canceling the trip, the author is not respecting Amy's perspective and the potential harm to their relationship.\n"
