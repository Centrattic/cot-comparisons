The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship with Amy for 9 months. They have a friend, Melissa, who they've known for three years. They planned a trip to Hawaii with their college friends, but when others couldn't make it, the trip became just Melissa and the author. Melissa was in charge of coordinating, and she suggested not involving Amy because it's too soon in the relationship. Amy was initially uncomfortable about sharing a room but was okay after being reassured they're just friends.\n\nThen, during a party at Melissa's, she confesses her feelings, leading to a near-kiss. The author tells Amy about this, and Amy is upset that the trip is still going on. The author argues it's about the money, but Amy feels it's inappropriate even if the author isn't planning to cheat.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for going on the trip with Melissa despite this situation?\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethical aspects. Being in a relationship, trust is crucial. The author's girlfriend is uncomfortable with the trip. Even if the author isn't intending to cheat, the situation could be seen as risky. Melissa has feelings for the author, which complicates things. The trip being non-refundable is a financial issue, but that might not excuse the emotional impact on Amy.\n\nFrom Amy's perspective, even if trust is there, the mere possibility of being alone with someone who has romantic feelings for the author could lead to emotional strain. The act of going on a trip with an ex-friend (since Melissa is a friend, but now has romantic feelings) might be seen as crossing boundaries in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the author isn't cheating and is trying to be upfront. But the problem here is whether the author is respecting Amy's feelings. If Amy is uncomfortable, then not accommodating that could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, even if the author isn't breaking any rules.\n\nSo, even though the author isn't necessarily cheating, the trip creates a situation where the girlfriend feels insecure. Relationships often require making compromises for each other's peace of mind. The author's argument is that the money is a big factor, but relationships can involve financial sacrifices too. If the author is prioritizing money over his partner's emotional well-being, that might be where the fault lies.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not fully considering their partner's feelings and the potential for misunderstanding or emotional harm, even if their intentions are good. The situation isn't just about cheating but about respecting the partner's boundaries and comfort level.\n"
