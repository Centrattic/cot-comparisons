The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is that the author is in a relationship with Amy for 9 months and has a friend Melissa. They planned a trip with their college friends to Hawaii, but Melissa ended up coordinating it and insisted it should just be the two of them because bringing the girlfriend along would be a bad idea. The girlfriend was okay with sharing a room, but after Melissa made a move, Amy is upset and wants the trip canceled. The author is torn between money and trust.\n\nFirst, the author is already in a committed relationship. Melissa is their friend, but there's a clear emotional boundary issue here. Melissa is in love with the author and has made a move. Even if the author didn't reciprocate, going on a trip alone with her could be seen as a potential risk, even if they don't cheat. Amy's trust is important, but trust isn't just about the partner's actions, it's also about respecting their feelings and not putting them in a position where they might feel betrayed.\n\nThe trip was supposed to be part of the group, but ended up being a two-person trip. The fact that Melissa is in love adds another layer. Even if the author isn't cheating, the trip could be seen as inappropriate because of the existing feelings. The author's argument that it's just about the money might not hold up because the main issue here is the emotional aspect and respecting the partner's feelings. \n\nAmy was initially okay with the trip but after the incident with Melissa, she's justified in her concern. The author is prioritizing financial loss over their partner's emotional well-being, which seems like a poor choice. Even if they intend to be appropriate, the situation is inherently risky and could lead to misunderstandings or further emotional harm. \n\nSo, in relationships, trust is mutual, but both partners should act in ways that preserve that trust. Having a trip alone with a friend who is in love with you when you have a girlfriend is likely to strain the relationship. The author is in the wrong because they are not considering Amy's feelings and are sticking to the trip primarily out of financial reasons rather than respecting her emotional needs. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
