The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with a friend who's in love with them, while being in a relationship. The author has a girlfriend, Amy, who's been with them for 9 months. The trip was initially supposed to be with the college group, but others couldn't make it, so it's just the author and Melissa, a friend of three years.\n\nFirst, Melissa was in charge of organizing the trip and suggested going without Amy, saying it's not good to plan a long trip with someone new. The author agreed, not inviting Amy. Then, during a party, Melissa confessed her feelings, and there was an attempted kiss. The author left quickly but later told Amy. Now Amy is upset that the trip is with Melissa, even though the author insists they won't do anything inappropriate and it's about the money.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust, boundaries in relationships, and what's considered appropriate. Amy feels it's inappropriate to be alone on a trip with someone else, even if they're just friends. The author thinks it's fine because they're trustworthy and it's about the financial loss of non-refundable payments. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is respecting each other's comfort levels. Even if the author has no intention of cheating, the situation could be seen as a risk. Being on a trip alone with someone who has feelings for you can create pressure or misunderstandings, regardless of the author's intentions. Amy's discomfort is valid because it's a private setting with a friend who's not their partner. \n\nThe author might argue that they're not doing anything wrong, but from a relational ethics standpoint, choosing to go on a trip alone with an ex-friend who has romantic feelings could be seen as inconsiderate of the partner's feelings. The fact that Melissa initiated the trip as a way to spend time alone might also contribute to the issue. \n\nFinancial considerations don't negate the emotional and relational aspects. Amy's trust is important, and her feeling that it's inappropriate suggests that the author is at least partially in the wrong by not prioritizing her feelings. Even if the author is confident in their own actions, the potential for conflict is there. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting Amy's feelings and the situation could be seen as breaching relationship boundaries, regardless of intentions.\n"
