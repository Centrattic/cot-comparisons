The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for going on a trip with Melissa, who is in love with them, while they have a girlfriend, Amy. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been with Amy for 9 months. Melissa is a friend they've known for 3 years. They planned a trip for their college friends to Hawaii, but when it fell through, it became just the two of them. Amy was uncomfortable with sharing a room, but okay once assured they were friends. Then Melissa made a move, confessed feelings, tried to kiss, and now Amy is upset about the trip.\n\nSo, the author is now arguing that they want to go because of the money, and Amy is upset. The key points here: Melissa is in love and has made a move, and the trip is now just the two of them. The author is saying they trust themselves not to cheat, but Amy doesn't feel comfortable.\n\nHmm. From an ethical standpoint, even if you don't cheat, being alone on a trip with someone who is in love with you can be seen as a conflict of interest. It's about respecting your partner's feelings and trust. Amy's trust is important. Even if the author feels they can stay appropriate, the situation itself is problematic. Melissa's feelings complicate things, and the trip being a romantic setting (like Hawaii) might add to that.\n\nAlso, the author did plan this trip without Amy, which might not be a great start. Even if Melissa initially suggested not involving Amy because it was a new relationship, it's the author's choice to proceed without their partner. The fact that Melissa made a move and then the author is still going on the trip could be seen as neglecting Amy's trust and emotional needs. \n\nMoney is a factor, but relationships require flexibility. If non-refundable is a big issue, maybe they can find a way to adjust, but at what cost to the relationship? The author is prioritizing money over the partner's emotional well-being, which might be the wrong choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because the situation is inherently risky and disrespectful to Amy's feelings. Even if no physical infidelity occurs, the emotional betrayal is there. So answer A.\n"
