The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to go on a trip with Melissa, who's in love with him, while he's in a relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, the author is in a committed relationship with Amy, which is only 9 months old. Then he has a friend, Melissa, who's been a friend for 3 years. They planned a trip, originally intending to include the college group, but that fell through. Now it's just the two of them. The key points here are that Amy was initially okay with sharing a room but uncomfortable, but after being assured they're just friends, she was okay. Then, Melissa made a move, confessing her feelings and trying to kiss him. The author told Melissa he wasn't feeling well and left. \n\nWhen he told Amy, she wanted to cancel the trip, but the author is hesitant because of the money. He argues that he's not going to cheat and that Amy should trust him. Amy, however, is upset and feels it's inappropriate regardless of money. The author is now asking if he's wrong to go on the trip anyway.\n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, going on a private trip with someone who's in love with you can be seen as a risk, even if the person claims they won't act on it. Trust and boundaries are crucial here. Even if the author has no intention of cheating, the trip could lead to situations that might test their relationship. Amy's discomfort isn't just about money; she's worried about the potential for emotional or physical infidelity. The fact that Melissa is in love with him adds another layer of tension.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that money is the main issue, but Amy's trust in him isn't the only factor. The situation could be seen as a potential for conflict, even if the author is confident in his own actions. The trip might create an environment where misunderstandings or temptations arise, which could affect the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, partners often set boundaries to avoid such situations. The fact that Amy is upset and the situation has already caused tension suggests that going on the trip might not be respectful of her feelings. The author might be prioritizing financial loss over his partner's emotional well-being. \n\nEven if there's no intention to cheat, the perception of impropriety can still harm a relationship. The author's insistence on going despite Amy's clear discomfort could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the importance she places on the relationship's integrity. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his partner's feelings and the potential risks to the relationship, even if he believes he can handle the situation.\n"
