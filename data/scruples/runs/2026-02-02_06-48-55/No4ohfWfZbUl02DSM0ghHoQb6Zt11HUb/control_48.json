She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative reaction, saying they'd go to Hell and wouldn't accept them. The mom isn't responding. The person then told their mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The person was hurt and angry, which is understandable. They felt powerless, so they reached out to their mom's friends. On one hand, sharing someone's private information without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The mom might have considered her beliefs private, even if they're hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's behavior is harmful, especially since she's targeting her own child. The person could argue they were protecting their own well-being and maybe trying to warn others about her homophobia. However, the act of informing others about someone's private views without their consent is typically considered a violation of privacy, regardless of the content.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of spreading information that could damage relationships. The mom's friends might now have a different view of her, and the person might have overstepped by sharing this without considering the consequences. Even if the mom's beliefs are problematic, the method of confronting them by informing others is questionable.\n\nBut then again, the person was in emotional distress. It's possible they didn't think through the implications. The key points here are consent and privacy. Did they have a right to share their mom's beliefs with others? Probably not, regardless of the reason. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were to seek support or warn others.\n"
