She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them after coming out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author came out as gay, faced rejection from their mother, who is religious and holds negative views towards homosexuality. The mother also has gay friends but hasn't expressed her views to them. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, decided to message one of the mother's gay friends to inform them about the mother's homophobia.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author's action was justified. The author's motivation was likely a mix of hurt and wanting to protect the friends from being hurt by the mother's stance. However, there are ethical considerations here. The author shared private information about their mother's reaction without her consent. Even if the mother's views are harmful, the author took it upon themselves to inform the friends, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the friends deserve to know that their friend holds harmful beliefs, especially since they might not be aware of the mother's true stance. On the other hand, the author didn't consider the mother's right to privacy and might have acted out of anger rather than a rational decision. \n\nAlso, the act of informing the friends could be seen as a form of retaliation or seeking validation. The author's emotional state at the time might have influenced their judgment. While the mother's rejection is indeed problematic, the author's method of addressing it could have been more constructive. \n\nIn terms of ethics, gossiping about someone's private beliefs without their consent can damage relationships. The author didn't give their mother a chance to change her views or address the issue directly. Instead, they chose to disclose information that could harm the mother's relationships with her friends. \n\nSo, even though the mother's behavior is unacceptable, the author's approach might not be the right way to handle it. The author could have sought support from the friends in a different manner without violating their mother's privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for breaching confidentiality, even if their intentions were to protect others.\n"
