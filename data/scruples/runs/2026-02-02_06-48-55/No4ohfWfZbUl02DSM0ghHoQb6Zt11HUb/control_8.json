She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her homophobia is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who reacted badly, saying they'd go to hell and being dismissive. The mom isn't responding anymore. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, then shared this information with the mom's gay friends, explaining her homophobia. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here: the mom is a homophobe, the author is hurt, and they reached out to the mom's friends to inform them about her stance. Now, the question is about whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, there's a conflict between the personal harm the author is experiencing and the privacy of their mother. On one hand, the author might feel justified in wanting to warn the mom's friends about her true nature, especially if they know the friends are part of the LGBTQ+ community. They might think the friends deserve to know so they can protect themselves from similar harm.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing personal information about someone without their consent, even if it's about negative behavior, can cross into violating privacy. The author didn't ask their mom's permission and shared details that could be seen as exposing her. That could damage relationships and might be considered gossiping or spreading personal information.\n\nBut considering the context, the author was in a vulnerable state, feeling betrayed and hurt. Their action could be seen as a form of self-defense, trying to protect others from experiencing the same rejection. However, it's important to consider if there were other ways to address the situation, like setting boundaries or seeking support without involving others' friends.\n\nThe mom's behavior is problematic, and the author's action might be an attempt to hold her accountable. But the method chosen\u2014telling her friends without her consent\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth, but the author isn't in a position to act as a mediator in their relationship with their mom.\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private behavior without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intentions are good. The author might have thought they were helping the friends, but it's possible that the friends would prefer to handle their own interactions with the mom. Additionally, the author's action could escalate tensions in the family and potentially harm their own relationship with the mom further.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, acting out of anger and hurt without considering the consequences might put them in the wrong. The right approach might have been to seek support for themselves, perhaps through counseling or support groups, rather than involving the mom's friends directly.\n"
