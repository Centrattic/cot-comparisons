She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about her reaction is in the wrong. The mom was very religious and rejected her child, which is heartbreaking. The person was hurt and angry, so they messaged her gay friends, explaining the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The mom's reaction was harmful and judgmental, which is wrong. But the child took it out on the mom's friends, who might also be part of the same community. The person's intention was to inform them about their friend's stance, but did they overstep?\n\nThe key points are: 1) The mom's behavior is clearly problematic. 2) The child's action was a reaction to being hurt. 3) The friends might not have known the mom's views. \n\nBut even if the mom is in the wrong, does the child have the right to out her to her friends? Maybe the friends already knew, but the child's message could damage relationships. The mother's friends might feel uncomfortable, especially if they value her opinion. The child might have intended to protect the friends from the mom's views, but sharing personal family issues in this way is a breach of privacy. \n\nAlso, the child was in a vulnerable state, acting out of anger. Does that mitigate the wrongness? Ethically, even if hurt, spreading personal family matters without consent can be seen as gossiping or damaging someone's reputation. The mother's actions are bad, but the child's method of addressing it might not be appropriate. \n\nSo the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the mom was wrong, the child's action was a breach of privacy and could harm relationships without a clear justification. The right approach would be to focus on healing and perhaps seek support elsewhere instead of retaliating.\n"
