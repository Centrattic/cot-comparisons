She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them after coming out as gay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, which the author expected but was still hurt by. The mom is religious and told the author they'd go to Hell and that she'd never accept them. She's not responding to their calls. The author feels powerless and then, in a moment of anger and upset, messages their mom's gay friends (who are themselves gay) to inform them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe. The author's reasoning is partly to let the friends know the kind of person they're dealing with, but also because they were upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a vulnerable state after a painful experience. They might have felt betrayed or needed to vent. However, they chose to share personal family matters with people who, while friends, are not directly involved in the conflict. The mother's friends might not appreciate being used as a platform for airing grievances. Also, the author's mom is their mother, and spreading this information could strain the mother's relationships with her friends, even if the mom's behavior is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom is being homophobic, which is harmful. The author might feel justified in protecting others from similar experiences, especially if they believe the friends are unaware of their mother's views. But is it the author's place to act as a mediator or informer here?\n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. The author shared private family information without their mother's consent. Even if the message was truthful, disclosing it to third parties could be seen as violating privacy. However, the content is about the mother's harmful beliefs, which might be a public interest if those friends are unaware of the situation. But the friends are friends of the mother, not the author, so the author might not have the authority to share that information.\n\nAnother angle: the author's action could be seen as a form of retaliation or seeking support. In their emotional state, they might not have considered the consequences. But is retaliation ever justified? It's a gray area. If the friends are indeed being misled by their friend (the mother) about her views, then the author's action could be a form of honesty, but again, the method of sharing is questionable.\n\nAlso, the author's mom's behavior is problematic, but the solution might not be to spread this information to her friends. It could cause further family conflict and might not resolve the underlying issue. The author's right to express their hurt is valid, but the way they did it might not be the best approach.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and privacy. While the author's intent might have been to protect the friends from the mother's homophobia, sharing this without the mother's consent could be seen as overstepping. The friends might have their own views on the matter, and the author might not be in a position to judge or inform them about their friend's private beliefs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action is likely in the wrong because they disclosed personal family information without consent, even if the motivation was to inform others about the mother's views. The right approach might have been to seek support through appropriate channels (like therapy or support groups) rather than directly informing the mother's friends.\n"
