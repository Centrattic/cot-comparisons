She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mother, who reacted poorly, using religious reasons to reject them. The mother didn't accept the author's sexuality and cut off communication. The author, feeling hurt and angry, then messaged the mother's gay friends, explaining the mom's rejection and sharing that she's a homophobe. The author is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nThe key points here are about privacy, betrayal, and intent. The author shared information about their mother's private reaction with her friends. Even if the mother isn't the most supportive, does the author have the right to disclose that information to others? \n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, when someone shares something with you, especially in confidence, sharing it with others can be seen as a breach of trust. The mother might have expected that her reaction was private between her and the author. Even if the author is upset, forwarding that to others could be considered a violation of that trust.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior towards the author and others. The author mentions that the mother has gay friends but still believes their actions are wrong. By informing those friends about the mother's homophobia, the author might be protecting those friends from being in a toxic situation or helping them understand their friend's true nature. However, doing so without the mother's consent could be seen as spreading gossip or revealing secrets.\n\nThe author's intent is another factor. They were upset and angry, which might have influenced their decision. They might have felt justified in protecting their own well-being or that of others, but it's important to consider if there were other ways to handle it, like setting boundaries without sharing private information.\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private behavior with others, even if that behavior is harmful, can be seen as a breach of confidentiality unless there's a public safety concern. Here, the issue is more about personal beliefs and family dynamics. So, while the mother's actions are harmful, the author's response might not be the right way to address it.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for spreading their mother's private reaction to others without her consent, regardless of the content of that reaction. However, some might argue it's a justified act of self-defense or to protect others. But from a strict standpoint of respecting privacy and trust, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
