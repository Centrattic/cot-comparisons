She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The author came out to their mom, who had a bad reaction, being religious and saying they're going to hell. The author felt hurt and powerless, so they messaged their mom's gay friends, explaining the situation and that their mom is a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's mom is friends with these gay couples, and the author is informing them about their mom's homophobia. On one hand, the author is protecting themselves and possibly trying to warn these friends about their mom's true beliefs, which might be hypocritical since the mom has gay friends but still holds those views. On the other hand, the author is potentially betraying their mom's trust by sharing private family matters without her consent. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The author's actions might be seen as a form of emotional response to trauma. However, sharing personal family issues with others without the other party's knowledge could be considered a breach of privacy. The mom might not have expected her child to disclose such information to her friends, even if they are not close. \n\nAlso, the author's intention here is important. They wanted to inform the friends about their mom's homophobia, which could help the friends understand her behavior. But is that the friend's responsibility? Maybe the friends would have realized on their own if they continued interactions with the mom. The author might have acted out of anger and hurt, which complicates the situation. \n\nAnother angle is the mom's hypocrisy. She's friends with gay people but still holds discriminatory views. The author's message might be exposing that hypocrisy. However, it's still the author's mom, and sharing such information could damage family relationships further. \n\nIn terms of ethics, privacy is a big factor. The author is sharing their mother's private beliefs with others without her consent. Even if the message is true, the act of sharing it without consent might be wrong. However, the context of the situation\u2014family conflict and personal trauma\u2014might mitigate some of the blame. \n\nI should also think about the consequences. Did the author's actions cause direct harm to the friends? If the friends were already aware of the mom's beliefs through her actions, maybe not. But if the mom's friends were unaware, the author might be causing unnecessary strain. \n\nThe key here is whether the author crossed a boundary. The author's mom is part of their family, and the author is sharing family dynamics with others. Even if the message is truthful, it's a personal matter that might not be the author's place to reveal. However, the mom's behavior is harmful, and the author might feel justified in exposing it. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are understandable given the emotional distress, the act of sharing their mother's private views without consent could be seen as wrong. It's a tough situation, but the breach of privacy likely places the author in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
