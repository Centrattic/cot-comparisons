She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them when they came out as gay. The author's mom is religious and didn't accept their sexuality, which led to the author feeling hurt and isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author came out and faced a negative reaction, which is really tough. They felt powerless and took out their anger by informing their mom's friends about her homophobia. On one hand, the author was justified in feeling hurt and might have wanted to protect themselves or warn others about their mother's beliefs. On the other hand, spreading this information could be seen as betrayal or gossiping, especially since the mom is their parent and they might have had some expectation of privacy or trust.\n\nThe key points to consider are: 1) Was the author justified in their actions given the emotional distress? 2) Did they overstep by sharing personal family matters with others? 3) How does the relationship between the author and their mother affect the morality of the action?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that their mother's behavior was harmful and they needed to protect themselves or inform others about her true nature. However, from a broader ethical standpoint, sharing such personal information without consent can damage family relationships and might not be the best way to handle the situation. It's possible that the author's actions were a reaction to being wronged, but that doesn't necessarily make them right.\n\nAlso, the fact that the mother has other gay friends and the author is telling them about her homophobia might be seen as a way to seek validation or support, but it could also lead to conflict between the author's family and their mother's friends. It's a complex situation where emotions are high.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for breaching their mother's privacy, even if the intent was to address homophobia. Alternatively, they might be seen as standing up for themselves in a situation where they felt attacked. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal values regarding family loyalty versus personal well-being.\n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the mother's reaction is problematic, the author's action of informing their mother's friends without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust. It's important to handle such sensitive issues with care, and there might be better ways to cope, like seeking support from other sources or therapy, rather than sharing personal family matters with others. However, I can see arguments both ways, but leaning towards A because of the breach of privacy and potential harm to relationships.\n"
