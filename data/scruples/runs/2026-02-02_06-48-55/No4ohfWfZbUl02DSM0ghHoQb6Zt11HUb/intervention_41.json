She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The situation is that the mom was very religious and didn't accept the author's sexuality, leading to them feeling hurt and angry. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's rejection and calling her a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is sharing personal family issues with people who are mutual friends. The mom's friends are gay, and the author is revealing their mother's stance on homosexuality, which is negative. The question is whether this was a justified action or if the author overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain and might feel vindicated by sharing the truth with people who are part of the community their mom is involved with. However, airing family business can be seen as a breach of privacy. The author's mom might have her own reasons for her beliefs, and the author is essentially outing her as a homophobe to her friends. This could damage the mom's relationships and reputation within her social circle. \n\nThe author's intent is important here. They mentioned doing it partly in spite and out of anger. That might reduce the justification, as it was an emotional response rather than a premeditated, well-considered action. On the other hand, if the author felt that their mom's friends should know the truth to protect themselves or to correct the mom's hypocrisy, there could be some argument for that. However, the friends might have their own ways of handling their relationship with the mom, and the author taking that step without their consent could be problematic.\n\nAlso, considering the impact: the mom's friends might now have to deal with the fallout, and the author's actions could lead to further conflict within the family. The author might also be projecting their own hurt onto their mom's friends, assuming they need to be informed. But it's possible that the friends are already aware of the mom's views through other means, or they might not want to be involved in the author's family drama.\n\nIn terms of ethics, confidentiality and respecting boundaries are key. Even if the author's actions were meant to expose hypocrisy, sharing personal family matters without consent can be seen as crossing a line. The author might have valid reasons for feeling wronged, but the method of addressing it by involving others without their knowledge could be considered inconsiderate or even harmful.\n\nSo, weighing the emotional distress against the breach of privacy and potential harm to relationships, I think the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
