She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they're going to Hell and won't accept them. The mom isn't responding. The author, feeling hurt and angry, told the mom's gay friends about this, essentially revealing the mom's homophobia. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about boundaries, honesty, and the right to self-expression. On one hand, the author is upset and might feel like they have the right to speak out about the mom's prejudice. On the other hand, the author shared personal family information with others without the mom's consent, which could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe mom's friends are gay, and the author told them that the mom is a homophobe. The author's mom already has those friends, even though she considers their lifestyle wrong. By informing the friends about the mom's reaction, the author might have influenced their perception of the mom. Is that right or wrong?\n\nIn terms of ethics, spreading someone's negative traits without their consent can be considered a breach of privacy. However, if the mom's actions are harmful or hypocritical (being friends with gay people but disapproving), the author might feel justified. But the mom's friends can make their own decisions about their friendship.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was both spite and wanting to inform the friends. Spiteful actions are generally seen as negative. The author might be projecting their hurt onto the friends, but the friends weren't the ones who harmed them. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author didn't have the right to expose their mom's views without her consent, especially if it's done out of anger. Even if the mom's views are problematic, the author's method might be wrong. The right approach would be to handle it through personal means, not by spreading the information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
