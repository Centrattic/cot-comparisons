She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious rejection and not accepting them. The author felt hurt and then, in a moment of anger, messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia. The author's reasoning was to warn these friends about their friend's true beliefs, even though the mom might not have openly discussed it with them.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for doing this?\n\nLet me break it down. On one hand, the author was hurt and upset. They might feel that they had a right to express their feelings, especially since their mom's behavior was harmful. But on the other hand, the author is sharing private information about their mom's beliefs and actions with others, which could be seen as a breach of privacy or gossip. \n\nThe mom's friends are gay, and the author is essentially telling them that their friend (the author's mom) is a homophobe. Even if that's true, the author is taking it upon themselves to inform these friends without their mom's consent. This could damage the mom's relationships with her friends based on the author's interpretation of her beliefs. \n\nAlso, the author's mom might not have directly told her friends about the author coming out or her reaction, so the author is inserting themselves into someone else's relationship. This could lead to misunderstandings or conflict between the mom and her friends. \n\nThe author might argue that they're protecting their friends by being honest, but the method of communication here is one-sided. The mom's perspective isn't fully represented, and the author is acting out of anger and hurt. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author mentions they did it partly out of spite. That's a negative emotion driving the action, which is not the best basis for making decisions. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be problematic, even if the intent is to expose harmful behavior. There's a line between defending oneself and betraying someone's privacy. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely overstepped by sharing their mom's private reaction with others, even if the content was true. The act of informing others without consent and in a moment of anger makes them responsible for potential fallout. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
