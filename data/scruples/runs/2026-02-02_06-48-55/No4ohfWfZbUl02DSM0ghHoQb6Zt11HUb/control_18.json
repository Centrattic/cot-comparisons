She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that the mother rejected them when they came out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a religious, negative reaction. The mom is friends with gay people but the author believes she's a homophobe and thinks those friends are going to hell. The author sent a message to the mom's gay friends explaining the mom's rejection and her beliefs, which upset the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's mom is friends with gay people but is homophobic. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, shared their mother's negative reaction with these friends. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Telling someone else's friends about their personal behavior can be seen as gossip or betrayal of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, like warning the friends about their mom's true beliefs, sharing private information without consent might be crossing a line. The author's mom's beliefs are her own, and even if they are incorrect or harmful, the author's right to share that information is questionable.\n\nAlso, the author was hurt and acting out of anger and hurt. But that doesn't necessarily justify the action. The friends of the mom have a right to privacy regarding their friend's personal opinions, unless those opinions are causing direct harm to them. The author's mom's beliefs about the friends might not be something that the author has the right to disclose, even if they believe the mom is wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the friends might already know their friend's views and the author is just confirming them. However, the author is sharing personal information about their mother's reaction to them coming out, which is sensitive. It's possible that sharing this information could damage the relationship between the mother and her friends, even if the friends are aware of her homophobia. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author had a duty to protect their mother's privacy. Even if the mother's actions were hurtful, the author is revealing private information about her. That could be considered a breach of confidentiality. Unless there's a risk of immediate harm to the friends, which isn't indicated here, the author's action might be seen as wrong.\n\nBut wait, the friends are already known to be gay, and the mother is friends with them. If the mother is a homophobe but is friends with them, maybe the friends are aware of her stance. The author's message to the friends might just be reinforcing that. However, the act of sharing the mother's reaction to the author coming out as personal information could still be a breach of trust. The author is sharing their mom's personal feelings and reactions without her consent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information about their mother's reaction without her permission, which could be seen as gossiping or betraying her trust. Even if the author was hurt, that doesn't justify the action. The friends might have their own reasons for keeping the friendship despite the homophobia, and the author's message could complicate that. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
