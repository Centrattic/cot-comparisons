She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious condemnation and cutting off contact. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia. The key issue here is whether the author was justified in sharing this information.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: 1) Did the author have the right to share their mother's private behavior with others? 2) Was the author's action a reasonable response to the hurt they experienced? 3) What are the potential consequences of their action on their family and the friends involved?\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, sharing someone's personal behavior without their consent can be problematic. Even if the mother's friends are also gay, the author's mom might not have shared her views publicly. The author's disclosure could potentially damage the relationships between the mom and her friends, especially if those friends value her opinion or have a good relationship with her. The author's intention might have been to warn the friends, but without their mother's consent, it's an invasion of privacy.\n\nEmotionally, the author was hurt and felt powerless, which is understandable. However, acting out of anger or spite might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation. The author might have hoped to protect the friends from future harm by alerting them, but this could also be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of addressing the issue directly with their mom or seeking support through other means.\n\nEthically, even if the mother's actions are wrong, the author's response could be seen as crossing a boundary. The friends might not appreciate being informed by their mutual acquaintance's child. It's possible that the author's action could lead to further conflict within the family and strain the friends' relationships. The author's mom might feel betrayed, and the friends might feel caught in the middle.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was trying to protect the gay friends from potential harm, given that the mother's homophobia could affect them. However, the friends might have their own ways of handling their relationship with the mother, and being blindsided by this information could be hurtful. The author's action might not have considered the friends' perspectives and could cause more harm than good.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the author's mother is clearly in the wrong for her reaction, the author's method of responding might not be justified. The appropriate approach might have been to seek support from allies, talk to a counselor, or focus on self-care rather than spreading information about a family member's private behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's action, while understandable in terms of emotional pain, crosses a line into violating privacy and potentially causing unintended harm. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
