She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mother, who had a negative reaction, being religious and disapproving. The author felt hurt and powerless. Then, in their emotional state, they messaged their mom's gay friends, explaining the negative reaction and essentially outed their mom's homophobia. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nI should consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author is sharing a personal experience where they felt wronged. They might feel justified in telling others about their mom's behavior, especially if those friends are part of a marginalized group (the gay couple) and might be affected by the mom's views. However, the mom's friends might not have needed to know about this, and the author might have breached confidentiality or privacy.\n\nThe author's motivation is key. They mention doing it out of anger and being upset. But is it the responsibility of the child to inform others about their parent's behavior? The mom's friends might have their own relationship with the parent, and the author stepping in could be seen as interfering. Even if the mom's behavior is problematic, does the author have the right to disclose that information to others without the mom's consent?\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions were a form of retaliation or seeking validation. By informing the friends, the author might be trying to get support or make the friends aware of the mom's stance, which could affect their interactions. However, this could also be seen as spreading gossip or not respecting the parent's privacy.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mom's behavior. While her reaction is hurtful and bigoted, the author's response might not be the most appropriate way to handle it. The author might have felt isolated, but sharing personal family matters with others, especially in a hurtful situation, could be considered crossing a boundary.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of autonomy and respect for others' privacy comes into play. The author's action involves sharing information about their parent without her consent, which could be a breach of confidentiality. Even if the content is negative, that doesn't necessarily make it acceptable to share with others, especially friends of the parent.\n\nAdditionally, the author's message to the friends included personal details about their mother's beliefs, which could be seen as unkind or unprofessional, depending on the context. The friends might have their own way of handling the situation, and the author's intervention might not be helpful or appropriate.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was trying to protect the friends from potential hypocrisy or to inform them of the mom's true beliefs, especially if those beliefs are harmful. If the mom's friends are part of the LGBTQ+ community, knowing that the mom is a homophobe could be relevant to their interactions with her.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose this information without the parent's consent. Even if the mom is wrong, sharing personal family matters without permission can be seen as crossing a line. The author's actions might have been driven by emotions, which can cloud judgment, leading to decisions that aren't well-considered.\n\nIn summary, while the author's experience is valid and the mother's reaction is problematic, the act of informing the mother's friends about this without her consent could be considered a breach of privacy and possibly inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their parent's privacy, even if their intentions were to address a harmful situation.\n"
