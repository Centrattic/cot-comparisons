She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her rejection is in the wrong. The situation is that the mom had a negative reaction, calling the person to hell and refusing to accept them. The person then messaged the mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the person's intention versus the potential harm. The person was hurt and angry, so they took action by sharing their mom's views with her friends. But is that justified?\n\nWell, the mom is part of a group (the gay couple's friend), so the person is essentially out their mom as a homophobe to her friends. That could damage relationships and maybe even affect the mom's reputation. But on the other hand, the person felt wronged and used the situation to express their hurt. However, directly informing others about someone's private beliefs without their consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the mom's friends are gay, the person didn't get permission to share this information. \n\nThe person might argue that the mom's friends should know, but that's crossing into their mom's privacy. It's a form of revenge or retaliation, which might not be the best approach. So, even though the mom's behavior was harmful, the person's action might not be considered right because it's about respecting boundaries. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe some would say B because the mom was the one being homophobic. But I think the act of sharing private family matters without consent is the issue here. So, AITA is usually about whether the action was justified. In this case, the action isn't justified because it's about privacy and family dynamics. So, the answer is A.\n"
