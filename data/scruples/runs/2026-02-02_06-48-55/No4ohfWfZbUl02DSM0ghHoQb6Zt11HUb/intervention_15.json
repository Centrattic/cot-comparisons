She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The author came out as gay, faced a bad reaction from their mom, who is religious and doesn't accept them. The mom also has gay friends, and the author told them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm, so the author is upset and hurt, which is understandable. They felt powerless and took out their anger by informing the mom's friends about her stance. Now, the question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Spreading someone's personal information without their consent, even if it's about their beliefs, might be seen as a breach of trust. The author's mom might have a right to her beliefs, even if they're offensive. However, the author felt justified because the mom had already been making harmful statements towards the gay community. \n\nBut the author's action could be seen as gossip or retaliation. Even if the mom is a homophobe, sharing that information with others might cause harm to the mom's relationships. On the other hand, the author was in emotional distress and might not have considered the implications. \n\nAlso, the friends the author told are part of a marginalized group themselves. The author might have wanted to protect their own mental health by seeking support, but did it in a way that could be seen as spreading their mother's negative views. Wait, no\u2014the author is revealing that the mom is a homophobe, which the friends might not know. But the author is sharing this personal information, which could be a privacy issue. \n\nAnother angle: the author's mom might argue that her beliefs are her own and that the author is violating her privacy by sharing them. However, the mom's actions (rejecting the author and spreading her beliefs) could be seen as harmful. The author's action could be a form of self-defense or advocacy for their own identity. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. However, ethically, sharing someone's personal information without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. The author's intent was to let the friends know about their friend's stance, which might be important for the friends to know. But the method of sharing it\u2014without the mother's consent\u2014could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for breaching their mother's privacy, even if the mother was hostile. The right to privacy usually applies to everyone, and sharing someone's beliefs, even if they're harmful, without consent might not be justified. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
