She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user came out to their mom, who had a bad reaction, saying they'd go to hell and being disappointed. The mom isn't responding anymore. The user felt hurt and powerless. Then, they messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their mom is a homophobe and explaining the bad reaction. The question is whether the user is at fault for doing that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions. The user is sharing their mother's negative reaction and beliefs with their mother's friends. The mom is friends with other gay people, and the user is letting them know that the mom is homophobic. The user did this in a moment of anger and hurt.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. Right to self-advocacy: Did the user have the right to speak out about their mom's beliefs, especially since those friends might not know the full story?\n\n2. Privacy and boundaries: Did the user cross a boundary by discussing their mother's private views with others?\n\n3. Intentions: The user was hurt and wanted to inform the friends about their mom's stance. Was this a justified action, or was it a breach of trust?\n\n4. Consequences: How might this affect the user's relationships with their mom, the friends, and others? Could it lead to further conflict or harm?\n\nI think the key here is whether the user had the right to disclose their mother's personal beliefs to others. Even if the mother's views are harmful, sharing that information without her consent might be a privacy violation. The user might have felt justified in protecting themselves or warning others, but it's important to respect family boundaries. Also, the user might have not considered the potential impact on their mom's friendships or their own relationship with her. While the mother's reaction is problematic, the user's action could be seen as retaliatory or a breach of trust. So, maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't respect their mother's privacy.\n"
