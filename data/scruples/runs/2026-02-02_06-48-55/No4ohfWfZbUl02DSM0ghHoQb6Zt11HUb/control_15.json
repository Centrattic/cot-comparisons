She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person came out to their mom, who reacted badly, called them going to Hell, won't accept them, and cut off contact. The person felt hurt and powerless. Then, they messaged their mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's behavior and maybe trying to warn them about her homophobia. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it was right or wrong to inform the mom's friends about the mom's views. The person might have done this out of hurt and a desire to protect the friends from being treated badly by the mom. But was this a breach of privacy or an act of self-defense?\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly harmful and discriminatory. The person might feel justified in sharing this information to protect others from similar treatment. They could argue that it's not their fault they had to take action when their family wasn't supporting them.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might have overstepped by sharing their mother's private reactions without her consent. Even if the mother's views are problematic, the son might have violated her privacy by disclosing her personal beliefs and behavior to others. However, the friends are already aware that the mother is part of a close-knit group, and if they're friends, maybe they can handle the information.\n\nBut considering that the mother has close friends who are gay, and she's not open about her views around them, the son's action could be seen as exposing her hypocrisy. The friends might already know her stance but perhaps not the extent of her hatred. The son might be trying to inform them so they don't get caught off guard, similar to a \"heads up\" about someone's true nature.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of emotional state. The son was in tears and acting out of anger and hurt. This might affect their judgment, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right or wrong. It's a mitigating factor in terms of intent.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mother's actions are definitely wrong, but the son's method of addressing it might not be the best approach. But considering the context of the son trying to protect others from a harmful person, maybe he's in the right. Alternatively, maybe he should have handled it differently, like talking to his parents first or not sharing personal family matters.\n\nThe community's response might be split. Some might say the son was within his rights to inform the friends about the mother's true nature to prevent harm. Others might say he shouldn't have shared private family info without consent. The key points are the mother's actions, the son's intent, and the potential consequences of his actions.\n\nIn the end, the question is about whether the son is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then it's because he breached privacy. If B (no), then it's because he was protecting others from harm. Given the mother's behavior, the son's action could be seen as justified as a form of self-advocacy and to protect others. So maybe the answer is B (no).\n"
