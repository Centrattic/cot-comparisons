She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that they came out as gay to their mom, who reacted negatively, and then the person told their mom's gay friends about the rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's mother is described as very religious and homophobic, leading to a poor reaction. The user felt hurt and powerless, which led them to message their mom's gay friends to inform them about her stance. \n\nThe main issue is whether it's right to out someone else's stance to their friends without permission. Even if the mother's friends are gay, the user is sharing personal family issues that might not be relevant to them. The user's mom might consider this a breach of trust, especially if she expected her friends to keep their own beliefs private. \n\nAlso, the user's motivation might be partly anger and hurt, which can cloud judgment. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the user's action of informing her friends could be seen as retaliatory. It's possible that the friends already knew about the mother's views, but the user's message might have caused additional strain on their relationships.\n\nAnother angle is the right to privacy. The user shares their mother's private beliefs with others, which could be seen as gossiping or violating confidentiality. Even if the friends are aware of the mother's homophobia, the user's message might have been unkind or one-sided, not allowing the mother to explain her position.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel justified in protecting their own feelings or warning others about a potential hypocrite. However, the method of addressing it by informing the friends directly might not be the most effective or respectful approach. It's possible the user should have sought support elsewhere, like counseling or support groups, instead of involving others in their family's private matters.\n\nConsidering all these points, the user's action seems to be a breach of trust and could harm their relationship with their mother further. It's an impulsive reaction to a hurtful situation, which might not resolve the underlying issues but instead create more conflict. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong.\n"
