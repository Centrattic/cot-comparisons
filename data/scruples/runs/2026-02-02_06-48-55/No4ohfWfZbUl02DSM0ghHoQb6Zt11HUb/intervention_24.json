She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about the mom's rejection is in the wrong. The person's mom is religious, didn't accept them, and the author felt hurt. Then they messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nSo the question is AITA (Am I the Asshole). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The answer should be A or B. The user is looking for an analysis of the situation to determine if the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the author came out, which is a personal and vulnerable step. The mom reacted negatively, which is understandable but harmful. The author was upset and decided to tell the mom's friends about the rejection. The friends are gay, and the mom is friends with them despite her beliefs that being gay is wrong. By informing these friends, the author is exposing the mom's true feelings, which might conflict with her public image. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mom's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's response could be seen as retaliatory or gossiping. They didn't confront the mom directly but instead went to others. This could be seen as spreading negative information about the mom without her consent, even if the content is true. \n\nHowever, the author's intent was to inform people about the mom's homophobia, possibly to warn them or hold the mom accountable. The friends might have believed the mom was more accepting than she was. The author's action could be justified as a form of self-defense or protecting others from the mom's harmful views. \n\nBut then again, the author is using the mom's friends as a venting target. It's possible that the friends were not asking to be informed about this, and the author might have overstepped by sharing personal family issues with others. \n\nThe key factors here are the intent and the method. The author's intent was to inform others about their mother's true beliefs, which could be seen as a positive intent. However, the method involved sharing private information without the mother's consent, which could be considered a violation of privacy. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, sharing someone's private behavior without their consent can be problematic, even if the content is negative. The author might have a valid reason, but the action itself could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mother was pretending to be a good friend to the gay community while harboring discriminatory beliefs, the author's action could be seen as exposing hypocrisy. However, the author could have handled it differently, perhaps by talking to the friends directly in a non-confrontational way or seeking support elsewhere instead of gossiping.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's action is a gray area. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether spreading the information was justified. If the friends were unaware of the mom's true beliefs, maybe the author had a reason. However, doing it in a moment of anger and without considering the consequences might tip it towards the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because sharing private family matters with others, even if true, can be seen as gossiping and respecting the mother's right to privacy, despite her actions. However, some might argue B (Not in the wrong) because the author is standing up against homophobia. But given the situation, the act of informing the friends without a clear right to do so might make the author the asshole.\n"
