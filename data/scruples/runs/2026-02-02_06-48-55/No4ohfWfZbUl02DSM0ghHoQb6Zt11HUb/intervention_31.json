She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom and then told the mom's gay friends about her reaction is in the wrong. The situation is that the mom was very negative, religious, and rejected the person. The person then messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia.\n\nSo, first, I need to decide if the author did something wrong. The main points here are the mom's rejection and the author's response. The author was hurt and angry, which led them to contact the mom's friends. The key issue is whether it's wrong to inform those friends about their friend's negative stance towards being gay. \n\nOn one hand, the author was upset and felt powerless. They might have thought that the gay friends should know that their friend is bigoted. But on the other hand, the author is essentially spreading their mother's views, possibly damaging her relationships. Even if the mother is wrong, is the author justified in sharing that information without consent? \n\nThere's a conflict here between the author's hurt feelings and the right to privacy. The author might be trying to protect the friends' feelings by warning them, but they're also using their own emotional state to decide to disclose something that affects their mother's relationships. \n\nIn terms of ethics, maybe the author overstepped. Even if the mother is wrong, the author's action could be seen as gossiping or betraying their mother's privacy, even if the mother is the one being discriminatory. The author might have a right to be upset, but taking the matter to the mother's friends could be seen as taking revenge or causing further harm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to inform people who might be affected by their mother's homophobia. But the method of doing so, by contacting them directly with personal, emotional messages, might be inappropriate. \n\nI think the key is that the author didn't get any of their mother's friends' permission to share this information. Even if the information is true, sharing someone else's private views without their consent can be problematic, especially if it's done in a hurtful emotional state. The author's intent might be to protect the friends, but the action is still spreading their mother's negative beliefs, which could lead to further conflict. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they violated their mother's privacy and possibly damaged her relationships without considering the consequences or seeking other solutions.\n"
