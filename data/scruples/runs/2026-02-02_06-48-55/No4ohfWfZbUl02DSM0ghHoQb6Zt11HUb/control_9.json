She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The mom is religious and didn't accept the author's sexuality, even calling them and their potential partners illegitimate. The author felt hurt and powerless, so they messaged the mom's gay friends to explain the situation and reveal the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the ethical implications here. The author's main motivation was to inform their mother's friends about her stance, which is homophobic. The friends in question are gay, so the author might have felt that the friends were being mislead by the mom's behavior. But is it right to out someone's family member's private views without permission?\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their own feelings and possibly trying to prevent their friends (the mom's friends) from being in a harmful situation. They might have felt that the friends deserved to know the truth about the mom's beliefs, especially since the mom might not be honest about her views. On the other hand, the author is violating their mother's privacy by sharing personal information about her religious views and how she reacted to the coming out.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of confidentiality and trust within a family. Even though the mom is a homophobe, the author might have a responsibility to keep family matters private unless there's a direct harm. However, if the mom is being hypocritical by being friends with gay people while holding those beliefs, the author could argue that it's important to expose that inconsistency.\n\nBut does the author have the right to act as a messenger or whistleblower here? The friends are adults and can make their own decisions. The author's actions might have been out of spite or emotional distress, which could be seen as immature. Also, sharing a family member's private views without their consent is generally considered a breach of trust, even if the views are harmful.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author's intent was to inform the friends and maybe protect them from the mom's hypocrisy, but the method involved disclosing private information. The key question is whether the ends justify the means. In most ethical frameworks, even if the intention is good, violating someone's privacy is usually considered wrong unless there's an imminent harm, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for breaching their mother's privacy, even if the mother's actions are problematic.\n"
