She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was very negative about the child coming out, using religious reasons to reject them. The child was hurt and upset, which led them to message the mother's gay friends about her homophobia. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author did something wrong by sharing this information. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly harmful and prejudiced. The child was in emotional distress and might have felt justified in wanting to inform the friends about the mother's stance. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's action involves spreading information about their parent's beliefs to others without the parent's consent. Even if the mother is wrong, the act of sharing personal family matters with others could be seen as a breach of privacy. The author might have crossed a line by using the friends' own identities (as gay individuals) to highlight the mother's homophobia, which could be hurtful or stigmatizing to the friends if they weren't expecting that.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and impact. The author's intent was to inform the friends about their friend's homophobia, possibly in self-defense or to seek support. However, the impact could be that the friends feel targeted or that their privacy is invaded. Also, the method of communication (during a moment of anger and distress) might not have been the most thoughtful approach.\n\nAdditionally, while the mother is clearly wrong in her treatment of her child, the author's response might not be the most constructive. Instead of confronting the mother directly or seeking support through appropriate channels, they shared private family information with others. This could damage relationships between the mother and her friends, and potentially cause unnecessary harm.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between standing up for oneself and respecting others' privacy. The author might have thought they were protecting themselves, but the act of spreading this information without considering the friends' perspectives could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong. The action was a breach of privacy and could have unintended consequences, even if the motivation was understandable. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
