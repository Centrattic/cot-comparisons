She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The situation is that the mom is religious, didn't accept the kid being gay, said they'd go to hell and was disappointed. The kid then told the mom's gay friends about the rejection and the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm. The core issue here is whether it's wrong to disclose someone's potentially negative or harmful behavior to others, especially friends. On one hand, the person is hurt and upset, and maybe they felt they had no other way to express their feelings. On the other hand, the mom might have a right to privacy, and sharing her views with her friends could be seen as betraying trust or interfering.\n\nI need to consider the context. The mom is a homophobe and has several gay friends. The person in question came out and was rejected, leading to emotional distress. They reached out to the mom's friends, possibly to warn them about her stance. Is this a breach of privacy, or is it justified as a form of self-advocacy or protection?\n\nAlso, the person mentions they were upset and maybe did it in spite. The action was taken in a moment of vulnerability. But does that make it okay? Or does it make it more of a mistake because of emotional distress?\n\nAnother angle: the mom's friends might have wanted to know the truth about her views, especially if they're part of the LGBTQ+ community. The person might be protecting those friends from being in a toxic situation. However, the method of disclosure is one-sided\u2014only sharing the mom's negative side without context. That could damage the mom's relationships and reputation.\n\nBut is the person wrong for doing this? Some might say that even if the mom is wrong, sharing this information without her consent is a breach of confidentiality. Others might argue that it's a form of self-defense, especially when the mom's actions are harmful.\n\nIn similar situations, like a parent being abusive, sharing that info with others might be seen as justified. But here, it's more about homophobia and rejection. The line between protecting oneself/others and respecting privacy is thin.\n\nI think the key points are: the person was hurt, the mom's views are harmful, the disclosure could have been done to protect the friends, but done in a private way without the mom's input. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. However, in most cases, sharing someone's private behavior with their friends without consent is usually considered a betrayal, even if the intent is good. So the person might be in the wrong for breaching trust, even if their reasons are understandable.\n"
