She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her homophobia is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they're going to hell and being dismissive. The mom also has gay friends, but she's judgmental about them. The author, feeling hurt and angry, messaged these friends to inform them about their mom's views.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to do that. Let me break it down. On one hand, the author was hurt and wanted to share their experience. On the other, they might have crossed a line by sharing their parent's private views without permission. \n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. Even if the mom is being homophobic, the author shared personal family matters with others. That could be seen as breaching privacy. The mom's friends might have a right to know if their friend is being prejudiced, but the author didn't get the mom's consent. \n\nIntent matters too. The author said they did it partly out of spite. Acting out of anger might not be a good justification. Also, maybe the author hoped their friends would confront the mom, which could lead to conflict. But the friends might not appreciate being informed this way. \n\nAnother angle: the author is in a vulnerable position, coming out and facing rejection. Their actions might stem from a place of hurt. But does that excuse sharing private family issues? Possibly not. There's a difference between sharing one's story and spreading someone else's private beliefs.\n\nAlso, considering the mom's friends, they might already be aware of her views through other means. The author's message could validate their experiences or prompt them to address the issue. However, it's still the author's choice to share without consent. \n\nIn most cases, sharing a family member's private opinions with others without their permission can be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of the reason. The author might not be in the wrong if they felt it was necessary to protect themselves or others, but the method here seems more like retaliation than a measured response.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author acted out of hurt and anger, shared private information without consent, which breaches privacy, even if the content is negative. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
