She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author came out as gay and faced a negative reaction from their mom, including religious condemnation and disapproval. The mom has several gay friends, and the author, feeling hurt and angry, messaged these friends to inform them about their mom's homophobia.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author's intention was likely to share their experience and maybe seek support or validate the friends' potential feelings about their own friend (the author's mom). But is this an appropriate action?\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, the author is disclosing their mother's personal beliefs and reactions without her consent. Even if the mom's friends already know the author, sharing this kind of information could be seen as violating the mother's privacy. It's like spreading someone's personal views without their knowledge, which could damage relationships between the mom and her friends.\n\nAlso, the author's emotional state at the time\u2014being upset and in tears\u2014might have influenced their decision. Acting out of anger or hurt can lead to decisions that aren't well-considered. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. \n\nAnother angle is intent. The author might have wanted to warn the friends about their mom's stance, but the method of communication was direct and personal. The friends might have preferred to hear this from the mom herself rather than through their child. It could also be seen as taking sides or gossiping, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a vulnerable position, having faced rejection. They might have felt isolated and sought support from others who are in similar situations. However, sharing their mother's private reaction to her friends could be seen as airing family business unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respecting others' privacy and autonomy. The friends have the right to know their friend's views, but the author's method of disclosure might be inappropriate. Maybe the friends already knew their friend's religious beliefs, but the author added personal details about the rejection of their child.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are understandable, sharing their mother's private reactions without consent likely crossed a boundary. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
