She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about the mom's rejection is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person came out as gay, and their mom reacted badly, being religious and disapproving. The mom cut off contact, which is hurtful. Then the person, feeling upset and powerless, messaged their mom's gay friends to tell them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the question is whether this action of informing the mom's friends is wrong. On one hand, the person was hurt and wanted to share their truth. On the other hand, maybe they crossed a line by revealing their mom's views to others without her consent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's the aspect of privacy. Did the person have the right to tell others about their parent's beliefs? Even if those beliefs are harmful, sharing that information without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, the person might argue self-defense or protection of their own relationships, but in this case, it's about their parent's friends. \n\nAlso, the person's friends (the mother's friends) might have their own relationship with the mother. The person might have caused strain between the mother and her friends by revealing the homophobia. So, even if the mother's behavior is wrong, the son's action could be considered crossing a boundary.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The person was in a vulnerable state, upset and angry. They might not have been thinking clearly. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. The question is whether they were in the wrong. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, privacy is important. If someone shares personal information about a family member without their consent, even if the information is negative, it can be considered wrong. Unless there's a direct harm to others, like if the mom was abusive or something, but in this case, it's about beliefs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong (A) because they spilled their parent's privacy without consent. But some might argue that they had a right to share their experience if it affects others, like the friends' relationship with the parent. However, the friends might not need to know unless there's a direct impact. \n\nI think the answer is more likely A (they are in the wrong) because sharing private family matters without consent is generally not advisable, even if the content is negative. But there's nuance here. The person's intention was to inform the friends about the mother's behavior, which could be seen as a form of self-expression or even a way to seek support. However, the key issue is whether it was their place to do so. Since the mother didn't share her views with the friends, the son took it upon himself to do so, which invades her privacy. Therefore, AITA would lean towards A.\n"
