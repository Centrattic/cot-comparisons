She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them and is a homophobe. The mom in question is religious and didn't take the coming out well, even saying they'd go to hell. The author felt hurt and upset, so they messaged these friends to inform them about their mother's stance.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about the author's actions. They told close friends of their mom that the mom is a homophobe. The friends are gay, which the author knows, and the mom already has negative views towards them. By spreading this information, the author might have breached confidentiality or acted out of spite. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is dealing with a hurtful situation and might feel powerless. They might have thought that the friends had a right to know about the mom's true feelings. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by sharing personal family matters without the mom's consent, especially if it's spreading gossip or damaging the mom's reputation. \n\nAlso, the author's intent matters. They mentioned doing it in spite and out of anger. That could indicate poor judgment during an emotional time. The friends might have been expecting a certain kind of person from the mom, and the author's message could have caused conflict or hurt for them as well. \n\nIs there a better way to handle this? Maybe, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't have the mom's permission to share this information, and especially if the friends weren't directly involved or asking for it, then sharing it without considering the consequences could be wrong. The author might have violated the mom's privacy or spread negative information that wasn't theirs to share. \n\nSo, weighing all that, I think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they shared personal family dynamics without consent and in a potentially harmful way, even if their intention was to inform others about their mother's beliefs.\n"
