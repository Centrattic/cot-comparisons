She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The mom is religious and said they'd go to hell, didn't accept them, and hasn't been responding. The author then messaged the mom's gay friends to explain what happened and that their mom is a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is hurt and upset. Coming out and facing rejection from a parent is really tough. They might have felt isolated or wanted to vent, especially since the mom's friends are also gay. The author might have thought that the friends should know the truth because the mom had said negative things about being gay. Maybe they wanted to protect the friends from being misled if the mom claimed she was a good friend or tolerant. Alternatively, the author might have acted out of anger or hurt and didn't think about the consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't ask the mom's permission to share this info. The mom's friends might not want to know about this, or it could complicate their relationship with the mom. Even if the mom is a homophobe, spreading that information could be seen as gossiping or betraying the author's mom's trust. The author might have overstepped by using the friends as a way to confront their mom indirectly. Also, the friends might have their own dynamics with the mom and their own ways of handling it. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent versus the action. They were hurt and upset, which can cloud judgment. But sharing someone else's beliefs or actions without their consent, even if you disagree with them, can be problematic. The friends might have wanted to handle the situation themselves if they knew. The author might not have considered that the mom's friends might not want to be involved or could face backlash from the mom. \n\nI think in most cases, it's about respecting privacy, even if the person is wrong. The author's action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality between parent and child. Even if the mom's views are harmful, the author had the responsibility to handle the situation in a way that doesn't involve other people without their consent. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. But maybe some people would say it's justified because the mom is the one being wrong. However, the act of informing others without their knowledge is a privacy issue. So, I'm leaning towards AITA being the author is in the wrong.\n"
