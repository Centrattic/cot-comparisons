She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out and called them a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author came out as gay and faced a negative reaction from their mom, who is religious and expressed that they'd go to hell. The mom isn't responding, and the author is hurt. In their anger and upset, they messaged some of the mom's gay friends, explaining the rejection and labeling the mom as a homophobe. \n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. The key factors here are intent, the context of the situation, and the potential harm caused. The author was clearly in an emotional state, which might mitigate the action. They were hurt and felt powerless, so they lashed out by informing the friends about their mom's behavior. \n\nBut, is that justified? On one hand, the mom's actions were harmful, and the author might have felt the need to protect others from similar treatment. On the other hand, the author didn't seek to confront their mom directly but instead went behind her back to inform her friends. This could be seen as gossiping or spreading negative information, which is generally considered a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the friends in question are already part of the mom's circle. The author might have thought that their friends should know the truth, but the method of communication was direct and private, which could be seen as a personal attack rather than a constructive approach. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author's family. The mom might now feel further alienated, and the friends might take sides, causing more tension. The author's action might not have resolved their own pain but could have made things worse for their family relationships. \n\nHowever, the author's situation is traumatic. Being rejected by a parent can be extremely hurtful, and the emotional state could cloud judgment. The action, while unwise, might stem from desperation and a desire to find support or validation. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is it right to expose a parent's private views to others without their consent? Even if the views are harmful, the method of response is important. The author could have sought support groups or professionals instead of contacting the friends. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty is important, but so is respecting others' privacy and not spreading gossip. The author's action could be seen as a breach of the mother-son trust, even if the mother was the one who wronged them. \n\nHowever, considering the context of the mother's own judgmental behavior towards other gay people, the author might have felt that the friends deserve to know the truth about someone they consider a friend. The author might be protecting others from similar treatment by the mother. \n\nBut still, the act of contacting the friends directly with the mother's private reactions could be seen as meddling. The appropriate step might have been to distance oneself from the mother's harmful behavior rather than retaliate by exposing her. \n\nSo, balancing all these factors, the author's action is unwise and possibly a breach of trust, making them at least partially in the wrong. However, the context of their emotional state and the mother's harmful behavior complicates it. The answer might depend on cultural or ethical perspectives, but generally, spreading private information in retaliation is considered wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
