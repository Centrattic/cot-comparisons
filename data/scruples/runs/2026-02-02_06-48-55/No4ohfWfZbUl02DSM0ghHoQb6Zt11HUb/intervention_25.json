She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they'd go to hell and wouldn't accept them. The mom hasn't been responding. The author then told their mom's gay friends about her homophobic views, essentially outing her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author was hurt and angry, which is understandable. But by telling their mom's friends about her beliefs, they might have violated their mom's privacy or betrayed her trust. Even if the mom's friends are also gay, does that justify the author sharing personal family matters? \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the author handled their own emotions. While it's valid to feel upset, acting out in anger might not be the best response. The author might have been trying to hold their mom accountable for her hypocrisy, considering she's friends with gay people but holds those views. But is that a valid reason to spread information about someone without their consent?\n\nI should think about the potential harm. The mom's friends might feel betrayed by the author's message, and the author could have caused further conflict within the family. The mom might feel her private beliefs are exposed, which could escalate tensions. On the other hand, the mom's actions are harmful too. But the question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nIn general, sharing someone else's private information without consent is usually considered a breach of trust, even if the content is negative. The author might have had the intention of exposing hypocrisy, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and spreading gossip or personal information. \n\nSo, while the mom's reaction was clearly hurtful and wrong, the author's response might still be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
