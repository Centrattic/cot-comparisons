She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The author came out as gay, their mom was very religious and didn't accept it, leading to a strained relationship. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's reaction is clearly hurtful and harmful. The author is upset and feeling powerless. They reached out to these friends, possibly as a way to cope with their own emotions. But did they overstep?\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author had the right to share personal family matters with others. The mom's friends are friends of the author too, but the author might not have been given permission to discuss the mom's private reactions. Even if the mom's friends are gay, sharing that information could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nOn one hand, the author is dealing with a difficult situation and might not have known how else to handle it. On the other hand, they could have approached it differently, like seeking support through other means or talking to someone else about their feelings instead of directly informing their mom's friends about her homophobia. \n\nAlso, the author's message might have been unkind or accusatory, which could damage relationships between the mom and her friends. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author's action could be seen as gossiping or spreading negative information without the mom's consent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect their mom's privacy and possibly acted out of anger rather than constructive intent. But there's also the aspect of being a victim of homophobia, which complicates things. However, the act of sharing that information without considering the consequences could still be problematic.\n"
