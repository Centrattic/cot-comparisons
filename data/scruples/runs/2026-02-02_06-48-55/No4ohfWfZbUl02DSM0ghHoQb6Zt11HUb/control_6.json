She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her negative reaction is in the wrong. The situation is pretty raw\u2014mom rejected the kid, called them going to Hell, and isn't communicating anymore. The kid, feeling hurt and maybe in a moment of anger, told the mom's gay friends about this.\n\nSo, the key points here: the kid's mom is religious and has homophobic views, even though she has friends who are gay. The kid, after being hurt, shared this info with those friends. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty is important, but so is respecting privacy. The kid didn't ask for permission to share their mom's views. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the kid is revealing their mom's personal beliefs to others. That's a breach of confidentiality. The mom might not want her private conversations with her child to be shared with others, even if she's friends with them. \n\nAlso, the motivation matters. The kid was upset and maybe acting out of anger. But even if the mom is wrong, sharing that information without consent could damage the mom's relationships with her friends. It's one thing to confront a parent about their views, but quite another to spread those views to others without their knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid was in a vulnerable position, facing rejection, and might feel like they have no one else to turn to. But in this case, the action taken was to inform others about the parent's stance, which isn't helping the situation. It's more about retaliation or self-expression rather than seeking support. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the mom's actions are wrong, the kid's action of sharing confidential family matters without consent is a breach of privacy. Therefore, the kid is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
