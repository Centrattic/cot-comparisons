She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative reaction, and now the author told their mom's gay friends about her homophobia. The user wants to know if the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author was hurt and upset when their mother rejected them. They reached out to the mother's friends, who are gay, and informed them about the mother's views. This could be seen as a breach of privacy. The mother might not have wanted her private beliefs and reactions to her child's coming out to be shared with others. \n\nOn one hand, the author was in a vulnerable position, feeling powerless, and acted out of anger and hurt. They might have wanted to protect their own feelings or perhaps help the friends who might be in a similar situation. However, sharing someone else's private information, even if it's negative, without consent can be considered a violation of trust. \n\nThe mother's friends might not appreciate the author using their personal relationships (like the dog show friends) to spread this information. Even if the mother's views are harmful, the author's method of addressing it by informing others could be seen as a form of retaliation or gossip, which isn't constructive. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mother being a homophobe towards her own child and others. The author might feel justified in exposing her for the sake of others, but that's a fine line. The key here is whether the author had the right to share the information without the mother's consent. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone else's private matters, even if the content is negative, can be considered wrong because it's not respecting their privacy. The author could have taken other steps, like seeking support elsewhere or encouraging the friends to have their own conversations with their friend (the mother), rather than doing it on their behalf. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were to protect others from the mother's homophobia. The act itself crosses a boundary, regardless of the intent.\n"
