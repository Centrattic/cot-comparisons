She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, the author came out and faced a negative reaction from their mother, who is religious and doesn't accept their sexuality. The mother also has gay friends, and the author shares this information with them out of hurt and anger. The question is about whether the author was wrong to do this.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is in a vulnerable position, dealing with rejection from family. They might feel justified in protecting themselves or wanting their mother's friends to know her true stance. On the other hand, the author shared personal family issues with others without the mother's consent. This could be seen as betraying trust or invading privacy, even if the mother's actions were hurtful.\n\nThe key points are: the author's emotional state when sending the message, the context of their mother's homophobia, and the act of sharing private family matters with others. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response might be considered a breach of confidentiality. However, given the mother's own judgmental attitudes towards others, there's a counter argument about hypocrisy and the author's right to self-advocacy.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, sharing private family issues with others, especially without considering the potential consequences (like damaging relationships between the mother and her friends), is generally seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author was upset, they might have overstepped by disclosing this information. So the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong, despite their reasons.\n"
