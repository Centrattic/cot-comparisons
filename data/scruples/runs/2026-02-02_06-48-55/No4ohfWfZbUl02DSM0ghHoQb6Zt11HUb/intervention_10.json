She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious rejection and cutting off contact. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The mom's reaction is clearly hurtful and unacceptable, but the author's response was to inform the mom's friends about her stance. The key points here are about privacy, intent, and the appropriateness of the action.\n\nThe author was hurt and angry, which is understandable. However, sharing someone's private beliefs with others, even if those beliefs are harmful, might be crossing a boundary. The mom might not have intended for her views to be shared, and doing so without her consent could be seen as violating her privacy. Even if the friends are gay and might be targets of her mom's homophobia, the author's message could damage relationships between the mom and her friends.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends are also victims of the mom's homophobia. By informing them, the author is letting them know that their friend holds these views. But is that their place to do? Maybe the friends would prefer to hear it directly from the mom or not at all. The author didn't give the mom a chance to address her own actions or apologize, which could have been a step before taking this action.\n\nAlso, the author's intent was partly out of spite, which complicates things. Acting out of anger without considering the consequences can be impulsive and might not be the most constructive way to handle the situation. The author might have hoped to protect themselves or others from future harm, but the method was direct and public.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the mom's behavior is wrong, the author's response might not be justified. The right to privacy is important, and sharing someone's views without their consent, especially in a personal context, can be problematic. The author could have sought other avenues, like setting boundaries with their mom or seeking support without directly confronting the mom's friends.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action of informing their mom's friends about her homophobia without her consent was a breach of privacy and trust. While the motivation might have been to warn the friends, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
