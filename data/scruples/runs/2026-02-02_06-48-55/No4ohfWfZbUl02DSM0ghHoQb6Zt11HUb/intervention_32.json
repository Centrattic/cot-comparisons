She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the scenario came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious rejection and disownment. The mom also has gay friends, and the person, feeling hurt and angry, messaged those friends to inform them about their mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's mom is openly homophobic, even to her own gay friends. The author, after being rejected, took the action of informing those friends about their mom's stance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, sharing someone's private or personal views without their consent might be considered a breach of trust. Even if the mom's views are harmful, the author didn't get to ask their mom first. However, there's also the aspect of the mom already having friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community and potentially pretending to be accepting while holding those views behind closed doors. The author might feel justified in exposing this hypocrisy.\n\nBut then, the act of informing the mom's friends could be seen as a betrayal of the mother-son relationship. The author might have overstepped by revealing their mom's private beliefs to others. On the other hand, the mom's actions are harmful, and the author was in emotional distress. There's a balance between protecting one's mental health and respecting boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is intent. The author's main motivation was to let their mom's friends know the truth, which could be seen as helping those friends avoid being used as part of a facade. However, the method of communication\u2014without the mom's consent\u2014might be problematic. It's a gray area because the mom's actions are indeed harmful, but the author's response might not be the right approach.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom is clearly at fault for her homophobia and rejection. The author's action, while understandable given the circumstances, could be seen as wrong because it's a form of retaliation and potentially violates the mother's right to privacy. Even if the mom is in the wrong for her beliefs, the act of spreading that information without consent could be considered a breach of trust.\n\nSo, even though the mom is being homophobic, the author might still be in the wrong for outing their mom's views to her friends without her permission. It's a complex situation, but the key point is that sharing private family matters without consent can lead to further conflict and may not be the most constructive way to handle the situation.\n"
