She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. \n\nFirst, the context: The author came out as gay, and their mom had a negative, religious-based reaction. The author felt hurt and powerless. In their anger and upset, they messaged their mom's gay friends, revealing that their mom is a homophobe.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author sharing their mom's beliefs and actions with others. Now, from a privacy standpoint, the mom's friends might not have known about her true feelings. Even though the mom claims she's not saying anything to them, the author is exposing her publically to her friends. That could be seen as betraying trust, even if the mom isn't a good person in this situation. \n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They were hurt and wanted to protect their friends, but did they have the right to do so without their mom's consent? The friends might appreciate knowing the truth, but the method of disclosure could be problematic. The author didn't ask for permission or discuss it with their mom first. \n\nAlso, the author might not have considered how their mom's friends would react. Maybe some of them know her better and can handle the information, but others might be offended or feel targeted. The author is essentially outing their mom as a homophobe to people who might not have known, which could damage relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is the one being judgmental and harmful. The author could argue they were standing up for themselves and their identity. However, sharing someone else's personal views without their consent can still be seen as wrong, regardless of the intent. \n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons, while the mom's behavior is clearly harmful, the author's action of disclosing that information without consent might be considered crossing a line. It's about respecting privacy and boundaries, even when dealing with someone who's been unkind. The author might have other ways to seek support without involving the mom's friends directly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
