She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The author's mom is religious, didn't accept their sexuality, and the author felt hurt. Then the author messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the mom is homophobic, the author is upset, and then the author decides to tell the mom's friends about the mom's rejection. The author's reasoning might be that they wanted to warn the friends about the mom's beliefs since the mom has gay friends but is actually against their lifestyle. But the author is using their own personal experience to inform others about the mom's stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this action is appropriate. The author's mom is close friends with these people, and the author is sharing their mother's private reaction to coming out. Even though the mom's views are negative, the author is essentially disclosing someone else's private information without their consent. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author is taking it upon themselves to inform others, which could be seen as slandering or violating privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because the mom's friends are part of the community that the mom claims to support, but the author believes the mom isn't truly accepting. However, the author has no right to act as a messenger for their mom's private feelings. The friends should know about the mom's true beliefs, but is it the author's place to tell them?\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is partly out of anger and hurt. When someone is emotionally upset, their judgment might be clouded, leading them to take actions they might later regret. In this case, the author's action could damage their mother's relationships and reputation. It's possible that the friends might feel betrayed if they find out the author shared personal information without the mom's consent.\n\nAnother angle: if the author's mom is indeed a homophobe, the friends might already have some idea. But the author is revealing specific instances of rejection, which is more personal. Even if the friends are gay, the author is sharing their mother's private reactions, which could breach privacy regardless of the content.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is sharing private family matters without consent, which is generally not acceptable. Even if the information is negative, it's not the author's place to disclose it. Unless there's a direct harm to others, like the friends being targeted or harassed because of the mom's beliefs, but the author's message was more about informing them about the mom's stance. The author's action might be a form of retaliation, which isn't justified even if the mom is in the wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
