She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out. \n\nFirst, the mother had a negative reaction, saying things like going to Hell and not accepting the author's sexuality. The author felt hurt and powerless, so they messaged the mom's friends to inform them about her homophobia.\n\nHmm, the author's intention might have been to warn the friends about their friend's true feelings. But is that their place to do? The mom's actions were hurtful, but does that justify the author spreading that information? \n\nI think about privacy and boundaries. The author is sharing personal family issues that aren't directly affecting the friends. Even if the mother is being homophobic, the author is revealing that to others without the mother's consent. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were upset and angry, which might have influenced their decision. Acting out of anger can lead to hasty actions that might not be well-considered. \n\nOn the other hand, the friends are part of a marginalized group themselves, and the mother's hypocrisy (being friends with them while being homophobic) is a point. But the author's approach was to inform them about their friend's true stance, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. \n\nSo, even if the mother is wrong, the author overstepped by sharing personal family matters with others. The right approach might have been to seek support elsewhere rather than disclosing it to the friends. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
