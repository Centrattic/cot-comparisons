She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted badly, saying they'd go to hell and all that. The mom stopped communicating, and the author felt really hurt. Then, the author messaged some of the mom's gay friends, telling them that the mom is a homophobe because she said the same things about them. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a lot of emotional pain after being rejected. They might have acted out of anger or hurt. But that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Let's break it down.\n\nThe mom is friends with other gay people, but she believes their lifestyle is wrong and they're going to hell. The author, upset, told those friends about the mom's views. So, the author is outting the mom as a homophobe to her friends, who are gay. Is that wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author had a reason to be upset. Their mom's rejection was hurtful, and maybe they wanted to protect themselves or others from the mom's harmful beliefs. But on the other hand, the author might have violated the mom's privacy or friendship by sharing her views without her consent. Even if the mom is a homophobe, is it okay to expose her like that?\n\nAlso, the author's mom might have a right to her beliefs, even if they're harmful. However, the mom is not being open about her beliefs to her friends. The author is revealing her hypocrisy\u2014she has gay friends but holds negative views about them. Is that a valid reason to inform the friends?\n\nBut then again, the author is using their own hurt to justify spreading information about someone else's beliefs. The mom might not want her friends to know her thoughts. The author could have considered other ways to handle the situation, like setting boundaries or seeking support elsewhere, rather than involving the mom's friends.\n\nThere's also the aspect of honesty. The friends might have a right to know if a close friend holds views that are harmful to them. But the author is a child in this situation, so maybe they don't have the authority to decide what the mom should or shouldn't share. The mom could have different dynamics with her friends, and the author might not be in the position to act as a messenger here.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. Their actions were likely impulsive and driven by emotional pain, but they did act on their own without considering the consequences to their mom's relationships. Even if the mom's views are problematic, the author's method of addressing it might not be appropriate. It's possible the author is in the wrong because they spread their mom's private beliefs without her consent, which could damage relationships and escalate the conflict. Alternatively, if the friends are being misled about the mom's true beliefs, maybe the author did a necessary thing, but the method is questionable.\n\nI think the key points are the breach of trust and the lack of consent from the mom. While the author's intent was to inform the friends about the mom's true beliefs, which could be seen as a form of honesty, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
