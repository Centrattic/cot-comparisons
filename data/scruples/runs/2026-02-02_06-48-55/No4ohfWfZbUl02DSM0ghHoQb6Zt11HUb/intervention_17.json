She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about her reaction is in the wrong. The mom was very religious and didn't accept the person being gay, which led to the person feeling hurt. In response, they messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia.\n\nHmm, the main question here is about whether the author did something wrong. The mom's reaction was bad, and the author felt powerless. But did they overstep by informing her friends? I need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the mom was being homophobic, which is definitely wrong. But on the other hand, the author took it upon themselves to share private family matters with others. \n\nThe author's intent might have been to hold their mom accountable for her beliefs, but spreading this information could be seen as gossip or violating their mom's privacy. Even if the mom's friends are gay, the author's action might stem from anger and hurt rather than a constructive approach. \n\nAlso, the situation mentions that the mom has friends who are gay, and the author knows she believes their actions are wrong. By telling those friends, the author might be trying to expose her mom's hypocrisy. But is that their place to do? Maybe the friends already knew about her beliefs, but the author's message could have been hurtful or damaging. \n\nI think the key here is privacy and the method of handling the conflict. The author was upset and acted in a way that might not be the best solution. While the mom's behavior was definitely problematic, the author's response could be seen as vindictive or crossing a boundary. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't handle it in a way that's respectful to their mother's privacy, even if the mother was wrong. However, some might argue that the author had a right to defend themselves against homophobia. But generally, airing family issues outside the family could be seen as wrong.\n"
