She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their religiously conservative mother, who reacted negatively, saying they're going to hell and that she can't accept them. The mom isn't responding anymore. The author then told the mom's gay friends about the mom's stance, probably to inform them about her homophobia.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's mom has friends who are gay, but the mom herself is against that. The author, feeling hurt, shared this information with the friends. The question is if that's wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people generally have the right to privacy. Even if the mom is homophobic, the author is revealing someone else's private beliefs and actions without consent. Spreading that info could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially since the author is part of the family. The mom might have shared these friends' contact info or be close to them, so the author's message could be seen as gossip or airing family issues.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation is also important. They were hurt and wanted to inform the friends about their mom's true beliefs. The friends might not know their friend is a homophobe. But is it the author's place to decide to tell others about their parent's private beliefs? Even if the mom is wrong, sharing that info without consent might be crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author was upset and acting in anger, which might affect their judgment. But does that make it okay? Probably not. The rightness or wrongness of the action might depend on the context. If the friends are genuinely unaware of the mom's stance, maybe the author is trying to protect them from being used or hurt. But again, it's the mom's privacy and the author's decision to disclose without permission.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the author is sharing private information without the mother's consent, which could be a breach of privacy. Even if the intent was to inform the friends, it's not their place to act as a messenger. Therefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
