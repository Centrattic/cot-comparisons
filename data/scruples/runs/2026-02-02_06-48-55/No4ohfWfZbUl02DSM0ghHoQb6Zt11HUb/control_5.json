She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The situation is that the mom is very religious, didn't accept the author's sexuality, and now the author, feeling hurt, informed the mom's gay friends about her homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable position, maybe acting out of anger or hurt. They reached out to the mom's friends, who are also gay, which might be a way to warn them about the mom's views. \n\nOn one hand, the author is sharing personal and private information about their family. Even if the mom's friends are aware of her beliefs, the author is essentially spreading that information, which could be seen as betraying the mom's trust. Privacy is a big factor here. The mom might not have wanted her views on religion or sexuality to be shared with others, even if she's expressed them to her child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was hurt and felt powerless. They might have felt that by informing the friends, they were protecting the friends from the mom's potential future harmful behavior. Like, if the friends are close to the mom, they might not know the extent of her homophobia. The author could be trying to prevent them from being in a situation where they're hurt by the mom's beliefs.\n\nBut then again, is it the author's place to act as a messenger for their mother's views? Even if the friends are gay, the author is sharing their mother's personal beliefs, which could be considered a breach of confidentiality. The author's mom might not want that information spread, regardless of the content. Even if the mom's views are negative, the author isn't in the right to share them without consent.\n\nAlso, the author's action was done in a moment of anger and emotional distress. That's a common human reaction, but it doesn't necessarily excuse the action. However, it might be seen as a cry for help or an attempt to find support. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth, but the method of sharing it is questionable.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends (the mom's friends) might have known the mom's stance already, but the author is confirming or revealing it in a direct way. This could damage the mom's relationships with her friends. But if the friends are also LGBTQ+, maybe they have a right to know if the mom's public persona doesn't match her private views.\n\nHowever, the act of informing others about a family member's private beliefs without their consent is generally considered a breach of privacy. Even if the content is negative, the act of sharing it without permission is ethically questionable. The author's intention might be to protect others, but the method isn't appropriate. There's a difference between sharing information and spreading gossip or betrayal of trust.\n\nIn summary, while the author had valid reasons for feeling hurt and might have wanted to protect others, sharing their mother's private views without her consent breaches trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
