She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person came out as gay to their mom, and her reaction was really negative, religious stuff, rejection, etc. Then, the author messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The author was hurt and upset. They didn't get support from their parents and felt powerless. So, acting out of anger or hurt might be a factor. But does that make it okay?\n\nOn one hand, the mom is being a homophobe, which is bad. The author might feel justified in exposing that. But on the other hand, did the author have a right to out their mom's views to others without her consent? That could be considered a breach of privacy. Even though the mom's friends knew she was religious and maybe had certain beliefs, the author is directly telling them that she's a homophobe.\n\nAlso, the author is using their mom's social circle against her. Maybe the friends already knew, but the author is confirming it. Could this be considered a form of retaliation? If the mom's friends were okay with her beliefs, maybe it's not the author's place to intervene. But if they are supportive of LGBTQ+ rights, then the author might be doing them a favor by informing them.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the act of informing others about their mother's views. Is that a violation of trust? The author didn't ask for permission. Even if the mom isn't a good person, does the author have the right to share that information without her consent?\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a concept called the \"harm principle.\" If the mom's homophobia is causing harm to others, then maybe it's justified. But in this case, the harm is directed at the author, not the friends. The friends might be affected if they find out their friend is a homophobe, but maybe they already knew. However, the author's action could damage the mother's relationships without her consent.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author was hurt and acting in anger. While that might mitigate the wrongness, intent alone doesn't absolve the action. The author's message was meant to inform the friends about the mom's stance, which could be seen as sharing personal family issues publicly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information about their mother without her consent, even if the motivation was hurt and anger. But there's also the argument that the mom was being a homophobe, and the author is trying to protect others from her views. However, the author's approach might not be the best way to handle it. They could have sought support elsewhere instead of involving their mom's friends directly.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because sharing private information without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the content being shared is negative, the act of disclosing it without permission breaches trust and privacy.\n"
