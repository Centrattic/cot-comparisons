She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about coming out as gay and then telling their mom's gay friends that the mom rejected them and is a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The mom's reaction was negative, religious-based rejection. The author felt hurt and powerless, so they reached out to the mom's gay friends to warn them about the mom's views. The question is whether the author did something wrong by doing that.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were in emotional distress and wanted to protect others from a similar experience. They might feel justified in wanting to let the friends know the truth, especially since the mom has friends who are gay but the mom still holds negative views. However, sharing someone's private beliefs without their consent could be seen as betraying trust. The author didn't just share their own feelings but also publicly outed their mom's stance, which could damage relationships between the mom and her friends.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the mom's friends should know, especially if the mom's views are harmful. But the author didn't confront their mom first, so it's unclear if there was an attempt to resolve the issue within the family before involving others. The act of spreading this information could be considered spreading gossip or violating confidentiality, which is generally frowned upon unless there's a valid reason like preventing harm.\n\nThe friends might have their own relationship with the mom, and the author's message could come across as accusatory or judgmental. The author's intention was to inform, but the method might have been inappropriate. There's also the aspect of emotional vulnerability; when someone is upset, they might act impulsively without considering all consequences.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between self-advocacy and respecting others' privacy. The author's actions might be seen as self-serving to gain support or validation, but they also wanted to protect others. However, the right to privacy and the potential harm to the mom's reputation versus the friends' right to know are conflicting here.\n\nIn many cases, sharing family matters with others, especially critical information about a parent without their knowledge, can be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might have felt justified, but the action itself is typically considered a breach of trust unless it's an emergency. The friends might have chosen to associate with the mom despite her views, so the author's message might not be necessary unless there's a direct impact on their lives.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they shared private information about their mom's views without her consent, which could harm her relationships and is a breach of trust, even if the author had good intentions.\n"
