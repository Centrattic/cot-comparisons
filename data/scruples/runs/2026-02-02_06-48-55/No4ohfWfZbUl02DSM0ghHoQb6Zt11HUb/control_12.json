She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay. The situation is pretty sensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author came out to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they'd go to hell and disowned them. The author felt hurt and powerless. They then messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was to let the friends know their mom's stance. But did they overstep? The mom had already made her views clear, and the author was upset. However, spreading this information without the mom's consent could be seen as violating her privacy. Even if the friends are gay, it's about how the author handled it.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified in protecting their identity and not wanting others to be blindsided if they interact with their mom. On the other hand, sharing someone else's private beliefs and actions without their permission could be considered gossip or interfering in someone else's relationships. The mom might have her own reasons for not accepting her child, and the author's action could be seen as retaliatory rather than constructive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were angry and upset when they did it. That might affect their judgment. But does that excuse the action? Maybe not. The key points are privacy, intent, and the potential harm caused. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth, but the method of communication could have been more diplomatic. The author didn't give their mom a chance to change her views or reconcile; instead, they took sides with others.\n\nI think the consensus here might be that while the author's feelings are valid, their action was a breach of trust. Parents often expect discretion from their children, and sharing such personal information could be seen as the child's fault. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
