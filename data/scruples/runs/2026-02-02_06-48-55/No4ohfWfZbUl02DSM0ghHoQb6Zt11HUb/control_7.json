She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author came out to their mom, who had a bad reaction, being religious and saying they'd go to hell and such. The mom stopped communicating, and the author felt hurt. Then, in their anger and sadness, they told some of the mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is sharing private information about their mother's beliefs with others. The mom's friends are gay, and the author is essentially badmouthing the mom to them. Even if the mom is a homophobe, is it right for the author to out her to her friends? \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel betrayed because their mom is rejecting them and being homophobic, especially when some of her friends are gay. The author might think they're protecting those friends by warning them about the mom's views. But on the other hand, the author is spreading their mother's private reactions without her consent. Even if the mom's beliefs are harmful, does the author have the right to disclose that information? \n\nAlso, the author was upset and acted out of spite. That could be a red flag. In a moment of emotional distress, people might act impulsively. But does that excuse the action? If the author had discussed it with the mom first, maybe things could have been resolved differently. \n\nAnother angle: the mom's friends might have trusted their friendship with her. If the author reveals the mom's true feelings, it could damage those friendships, even if the mom's beliefs are wrong. The author's action could be seen as meddling in her relationships. \n\nBut then again, the mom is being hypocritical\u2014being friends with gay people while believing their lifestyle is wrong. The author might feel justified in exposing that hypocrisy. However, is it fair to do so without the mom's knowledge? \n\nIn terms of the question, it's about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: sharing private information without consent, acting out of spite, and the potential harm to relationships. The mom's actions are questionable, but the author's response might also be inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because disclosing private information about a parent without their consent, even if motivated by hurt feelings, is generally considered a breach of privacy. However, there's a nuance here regarding the mom's behavior. But the main issue is the author's action of sharing the mom's reactions without her permission, which can be seen as wrong regardless of the mother's behavior.\n"
