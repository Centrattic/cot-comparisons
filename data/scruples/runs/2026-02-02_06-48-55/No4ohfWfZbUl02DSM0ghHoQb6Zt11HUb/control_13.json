She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The mother is religious, didn't accept the user's sexuality, said they'd go to hell and were disappointed. The user was hurt and in tears, then messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia. The user is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The user was in a vulnerable situation, dealing with rejection from their parent. They might have acted out of emotional pain. The mother's behavior is clearly harmful\u2014labeling the user as going to hell and disowning them. The user didn't confront the mother directly but instead told the mother's friends about her homophobia. \n\nNow, thinking about ethics here. Is it wrong to inform someone else about a mutual friend's problematic behavior? On one hand, the friends might benefit from knowing that their friend holds bigoted views. On the other hand, the user might have violated a trust, even if there wasn't an explicit one. The mother's friends might not have known about her stance, so the user could be seen as exposing a secret. However, the user's intent was to warn the friends about their friend's homophobia, which is a serious issue. \n\nAlso, the user mentions they were upset and acting out of spite. That could influence their judgment. But does that make it wrong? Sometimes people act out of anger, but that doesn't necessarily mean their actions are justified. However, if the mother's behavior is harmful, maybe the user had a right to speak up, even if it was done in the heat of the moment.\n\nAnother angle: the user's mom might have a right to her beliefs, but expressing them and acting on them in a harmful way affects others. The user's action could be seen as protecting themselves and others from the mother's bigotry by informing those who are also affected (the gay friends). \n\nBut there's also the issue of privacy. Did the user have the right to disclose their mother's views to others without her consent? Even if the mother's views are harmful, sharing them without her permission could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, the user is also a victim of that harm, so the line is blurry here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, I think it's a bit of a gray area. The user was hurt and acted in a moment of vulnerability. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth about their friend's beliefs, especially if they value a respectful relationship. But the user could have approached this differently, maybe by confronting the mother first or seeking support elsewhere before sharing the information.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's actions were harmful in intent due to their own hurt, the mother's bigoted views are the root issue. The user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were acting to protect themselves and potentially inform others about a harmful person. However, there's a case to be made that sharing personal family matters without considering the consequences could be problematic. But given the context of abuse and the user's emotional state, it's a bit more understandable. So I'm leaning towards the user not being in the wrong.\n"
