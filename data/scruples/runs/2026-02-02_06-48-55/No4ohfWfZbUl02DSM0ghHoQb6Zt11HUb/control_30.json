She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them when they came out. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative reaction, even saying they'd go to hell and not accepting them or any partner. The mom isn't responding to their calls or texts. The user was hurt and angry, so they messaged some of the mom's gay friends, sharing the mom's negative reaction. The user's reasoning was to inform these friends about their friend's homophobia, which they witnessed firsthand.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the user is wrong for sharing private family matters with the mom's friends. Let's consider the perspectives. On one hand, the user was hurt and felt powerless. They might have thought that the friends should know their friend's true stance on homosexuality, especially since the mom claims to be close to them but harbors prejudiced views. The user's action could be seen as a form of self-expression or a way to seek support, even if it's not the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private family information without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the mom's behavior is problematic, the user is sharing personal details about a family member's reaction, which might not be their place. The user could have addressed their hurt in other ways, like seeking support from friends or support groups, rather than involving the mom's friends directly. Additionally, the action might damage the mom's relationships with her friends, which could further complicate the user's relationship with their mother.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the action. The user mentions they did it partly out of anger and spite. While understandable emotions, acting on anger without considering the consequences can be problematic. However, the user's motivation was also to inform the friends about their friend's homophobia, which might be a valid concern if those friends are unaware of the mom's true stance. The ethical dilemma here is balancing honesty with respect for privacy and relationships.\n\nIn terms of cultural or societal norms, some might argue that the user has a right to express their experience, especially when facing rejection. Others might argue that it's not their responsibility to act as a messenger for their parent's behavior. The key factors here are the user's intent, the impact on relationships, and the method of communication.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't black and white. However, typically, in situations like this, sharing private family matters without consent is seen as crossing a boundary. The user's action could have been hurtful to their mother and strained her relationships, even if the intention was to hold her accountable. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not considering the broader implications and for not addressing the situation through more appropriate channels first.\n"
