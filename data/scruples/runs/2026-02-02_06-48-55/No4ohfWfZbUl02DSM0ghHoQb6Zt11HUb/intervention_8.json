She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person came out to their mom, who reacted poorly, being religious and rejecting them. Mom is also friends with other gay people but the person believes she's a homophobe. The person then messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their mom is a homophobe and rejecting them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, from a confidentiality standpoint, the author shared their mom's private reaction with others. Even if the mom isn't close with these friends, sharing personal family matters without consent is generally considered a breach of privacy. The author might have felt hurt and wanted to warn the friends, but that doesn't justify spreading the information.\n\nIntent matters here. The author was upset and wanted to inform the friends about their mom's stance. However, the friends might not appreciate being informed by someone who isn't them, especially if it's negative. The mom might not have discussed her views with them directly, so the author is inserting themselves into that dynamic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their mom has gay friends but believes their actions are wrong. The author is essentially accusing the mom of being hypocritical. But the friends might not want to know this unless it's affecting them. The mom's rejection of her child doesn't necessarily mean she's rejected her own friends, even if the author thinks so.\n\nConsidering the situation, the author acted out of anger and hurt. While understandable, sharing personal family issues without the mom's knowledge could be seen as tattling or spreading gossip. The friends might feel targeted or used as a way to confront the mom indirectly. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author crossed a line by sharing private information. Even if the intent was to inform others, the method was inappropriate. The friends might not need to know, and the author didn't give the mom a chance to address the issue directly first. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
