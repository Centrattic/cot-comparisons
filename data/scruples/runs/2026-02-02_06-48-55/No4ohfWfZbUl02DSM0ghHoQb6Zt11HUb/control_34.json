She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious rejection. The mom isn't responding, and the author is hurt. Then, the author messaged some of the mom's gay friends, telling them about the mom's homophobia. The author's reason was to inform these friends about their friend's stance and maybe out of spite.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Telling someone else's friends about a private family matter can be seen as a breach of trust. The author didn't have their mom's permission to share this information. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the act of disclosing that information to others might be considered an invasion of privacy. However, the author was hurt and upset, which is understandable. The friends in question are also part of the LGBTQ+ community, so the author might think they have a right to know about the mom's attitudes.\n\nBut, from another angle, the author didn't confront their mom directly about their concerns or seek to resolve the situation with her. Instead, they bypassed the mom and told her friends. This could be seen as gossiping or spreading rumors, which is generally frowned upon. The mom's friends might not appreciate being used as a way to air grievances without the mom's knowledge.\n\nAlso, considering the intent. The author mentions that part of the reason was spite. That could influence whether the action is justified. If the intent was to harm the mom's reputation among her friends, that adds a layer of malice. But if it was to inform others about a person who holds harmful views, some might argue it's a form of truth-telling for the friends' benefit.\n\nHowever, in most cases, spreading such information without the person's consent is considered wrong. The author could have approached the situation differently, like setting boundaries or seeking support through other means, perhaps involving a mediator or counselor. Directly informing the friends without the mom's knowledge might damage relationships and escalate the conflict.\n\nSo, balancing the hurt and intentions against the ethical implications of sharing private family issues. The consensus here is likely that the author is in the wrong because they breached confidentiality and acted out of anger without addressing the issue directly with the person involved.\n"
