She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author came out as gay and faced a negative reaction from their mom, who is religious and doesn't accept them. The mom and dad aren't responding. The author, feeling hurt and angry, contacts the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobic views and rejection. The author's reasons include wanting the friends to know their friend's true nature and also being upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Tattling or sharing someone's private behavior without their consent can be problematic. The author is revealing their mom's personal beliefs and reactions, which might not be their place to disclose. Even if the mom is being homophobic, the author's action is about sharing that information with others, which could damage the mom's relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain and felt powerless. They might have felt it was a way to take control or get support. But does that justify informing the mom's friends about her negative behavior? \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, generally, people have a right to their privacy. Even if someone is acting in a harmful way, sharing that information without consent could be seen as violating privacy. The author could have sought support elsewhere, like talking to a counselor or another trusted person, instead of informing the mom's friends. \n\nAlso, the author's mom might have her own reasons for not accepting them, and the author's actions could prevent the mom from having the chance to reconcile or change her views. \n\nSo, even if the mom is at fault for rejecting them, the author's action of informing the friends without their knowledge might be in the wrong. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
