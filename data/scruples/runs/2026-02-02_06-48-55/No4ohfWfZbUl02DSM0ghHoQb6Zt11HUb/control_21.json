She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person came out to their mom, and the mom reacted negatively, using religion to say they're going to hell. The mom isn't accepting and isn't responding. The person was hurt and angry, so they messaged their mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's stance and essentially outing the mom's homophobia to them. The person is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the person's mom is homophobic, the person was hurt, and they spilled the beans to the mom's friends. Now, the question is whether the person did something wrong by sharing that information.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The mom is not accepting her child, which is already a problem. The person, feeling powerless, took action by informing the mom's friends about her views. But was that right?\n\nFrom one angle, the person might have felt justified because their mom judged them and others. But sharing someone else's private beliefs, especially if the mom never spoke about them to her friends, could be a breach of privacy. The person might have crossed a line by revealing their mom's views without her consent, even if they disagree with her.\n\nHowever, the mom's friends might already know her stance, but the person's message could have added weight to her homophobia if the friends didn't realize how extreme her views are. The person's intent was to protect themselves and maybe their mom's friends, but they did it in a moment of anger and hurt.\n\nAnother perspective is that the person was defending themselves against their mom's rejection. But is it right to expose a parent's flaws to others? It might be seen as a betrayal or an invasion of privacy, even if the parent is at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they shared private family information, even if the mom's views are problematic. The person's actions could have hurt their relationship further and violated their mom's privacy.\n"
