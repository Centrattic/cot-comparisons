She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay. The mom is religious and didn't accept the author's sexuality, even calling them out for going to hell. The author then messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's mom has several gay friends, but the mom herself is a homophobe. The author did this out of hurt and anger. The question is whether sharing this information with the mom's friends was wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author was hurt and felt powerless. They might have felt the need to confront the mom's hypocrisy, especially since the mom's friends are gay but the mom disapproves. However, the author didn't ask for permission or consider the consequences. Spreading this information could be seen as invading privacy, even if the intent was to expose hypocrisy.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. The moral or ethical issue is whether it was right to share personal family information with others. The author might have thought they were helping the friends by warning them, but it's possible the mom's friends might have already known or might be hurt by this revelation. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a form of retaliation or revenge. Even if the mom's actions were hurtful, the author's response might not be the most appropriate. The friends might not appreciate being told about their friend's private beliefs, even if those beliefs are harmful. \n\nHowever, another angle is that the author was trying to hold the mom accountable for her hypocrisy. The mom's friends might have been unaware of her true feelings, so the author's message could serve as a wake-up call. But intentionally sharing this information without the mom's consent could still be considered a breach of trust.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate the balance between honesty and respect for privacy. The author's action was driven by emotional pain, which might mitigate some blame, but it's still a breach of confidentiality. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared their mother's private views without her consent, which could be seen as violating her privacy, even if the intent was to expose hypocrisy.\n"
