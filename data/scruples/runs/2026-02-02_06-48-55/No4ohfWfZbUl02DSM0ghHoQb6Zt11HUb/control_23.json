She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a bad reaction, saying they'd go to hell and was disappointed. The mom and dad stopped responding. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them about the mom's homophobic views. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author was hurt and upset. They might feel like they had no support and wanted others to know their mom's stance. But on the other hand, sharing personal family matters with others, especially in a way that could be seen as spreading gossip or attacking someone's reputation, could be problematic. \n\nThe mom's friends might have a right to know if the mom's actions are hypocritical, given that the mom has friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community. However, the author didn't confront their mom first or try to resolve the issue privately. Instead, they went straight to the friends. That might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intention was to protect the friends from being deceived.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling powerless and acting out of spite. That might indicate the action wasn't fully thought through, which could make it more of a mistake. But considering the mom's behavior towards the author, maybe there's some justification in wanting to inform others about her stance. \n\nI need to think about ethical aspects. Is it right to expose someone's private behavior to others? Even if the person is close to them? The author could have considered a different approach, like writing a letter to their mom first, or seeking support elsewhere instead of directly informing the friends. \n\nThe friends might have been caught off guard or hurt by the author's message. The mom might see this as betrayal, but the author could argue they're protecting the friends from a hypocritical friend. It's a tricky situation. \n\nI think the key points are intent, method, and consequences. The author's intent was to inform the friends about their friend's true beliefs, possibly to stop her from being in denial. However, the method was direct and public, which could damage relationships. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to handle such issues within the family first before involving others. So the author might be in the wrong for not exhausting other options. But given the mom's behavior, maybe it's understandable. \n\nStill, spreading information about a family member's private views without their consent might be considered wrong, regardless of the motive. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong). But I'm not sure. Some might argue it's justified in this context.\n"

While the mother's reaction was hurtful and hypocritical, sharing personal family matters with others in this context breaches privacy and could damage relationships. The author had the right to feel upset, but confronting the mother first or seeking support through other means (e.g., counseling, trusted friends) would have been more appropriate. Spreading the mother's views to her friends, even if well-intentioned, crosses a boundary and risks further conflict without addressing the root issue directly.",
