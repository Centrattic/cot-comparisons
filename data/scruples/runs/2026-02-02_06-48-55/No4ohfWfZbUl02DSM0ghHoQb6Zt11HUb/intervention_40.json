She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they'd go to hell and being disappointed. The mom isn't responding anymore. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe by sharing the mom's negative comments. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was hurt and upset after their mom's rejection. They felt powerless and took some action by informing their mom's friends about her beliefs. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have felt justified in wanting to protect others from their mom's harmful views. But on the other hand, sharing someone's private opinions, especially in a hurtful context, can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's mom might have confided in them before, and sharing that information without consent could be considered crossing a boundary.\n\nAlso, the author's actions might have been driven by anger and hurt, which can cloud judgment. While the mom's behavior is clearly problematic, the author's response might not be the right approach. It's important to consider the ethics of exposing someone's prejudices, even if they're harmful. However, there's a difference between sharing personal beliefs and making derogatory comments that affect others.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author was protecting others from a friend who holds prejudiced views. But generally, airing someone's private beliefs without their consent can damage relationships and isn't the most constructive way to handle the situation. The author might have been acting out of pain, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action could be seen as in the wrong because they shared their parent's private comments without consent, even if the parent's views were harmful. The right approach might have been to seek support elsewhere without involving the mother's friends directly.\n"
