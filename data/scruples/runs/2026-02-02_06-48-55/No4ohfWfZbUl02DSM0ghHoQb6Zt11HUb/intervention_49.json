She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person came out to their mom, who reacted negatively with religious rejection, not accepting them as LGBTQ+. The mom isn't responding, so the person is hurt and angry. Then, they messaged the mom's gay friends, telling them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe and rejected the person. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the mom's reaction is indeed problematic. She rejected her child and made homophobic remarks. But the author took it upon themselves to inform the mom's friends about her stance. That's where the conflict lies. \n\nIs sharing someone's negative behavior ever justified? It depends on the context. If the author was trying to protect themselves or maybe warn the friends about potential issues, but the mom's friends are already gay, so maybe they already know? The author might have felt wronged and wanted to hold their mom accountable. However, outing someone else's behavior, even if it's negative, can be a violation of privacy. The mom didn't publicize her views in a way that others needed to know. The author shared private family matters without the mom's consent, which could harm relationships. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation was partly spiteful. Even if the mom is at fault, the action of spreading this information might be considered crossing a line. There's a difference between confronting someone directly and spreading their beliefs to others. The friends might now feel betrayed by the mom if they found out, even if they agree with the author's perspective. \n\nSo, while the mom is in the wrong for her rejection, the author's action of informing others without their consent could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly harmful. The right approach might have been to address the mom directly or seek support elsewhere without involving others. Hence, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
