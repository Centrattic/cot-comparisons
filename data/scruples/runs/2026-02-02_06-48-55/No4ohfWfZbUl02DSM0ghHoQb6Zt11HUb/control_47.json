She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her rejection is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person came out to their mom, who had a bad reaction, saying they'd go to hell and rejecting them. The mom also has gay friends, but she's judgmental towards them too. The person, feeling hurt and angry, messaged these friends to tell them their mom is a homophobe. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the person is dealing with rejection from their family, which is really tough. They might feel like they have no support and are just trying to protect their mom's friends from similar treatment. But on the other hand, did they have the right to tell others about their mom's private reaction? Maybe that's sharing family matters without consent, which could be seen as gossiping or betraying trust. \n\nThe mom's friends might not appreciate being told this, even if it's true. It's possible they already knew their friend was judgmental, but the person might have crossed a line by spreading that information without considering the consequences. Also, the person was acting out of anger and hurt, which might affect their judgment. \n\nBut then again, the mom's behavior is harmful. If the author is trying to inform friends about her mother's stance, maybe it's to protect them from future hurt, but it's still their personal business. The author might not have the right to disclose that. So, is it the author's fault for sharing that info? Probably yes because they didn't get permission and acted on emotion. But the mom's behavior is definitely problematic. Still, the author's action might be seen as wrong because it's about keeping family matters private.\n"
