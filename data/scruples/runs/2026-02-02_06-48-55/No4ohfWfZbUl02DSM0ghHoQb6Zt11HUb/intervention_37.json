She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who had a very negative reaction, including religious rejection and cutting off contact. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their mom is a homophobe, even though the mom had previously not spoken against them directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is sharing personal family information with others, specifically about their mother's beliefs and rejection. Even if the mom hasn't directly criticized her friends, the author is spreading this information. Is that fair? Well, the friends are part of the mom's social circle, so maybe they have a right to know if their friend is acting in a way that contradicts their values. But the author is a minor in this context? Wait, the post doesn't specify the age, but maybe the mom's friends are adults. The mom's actions are harmful, and the author is upset. But is it the author's place to out their mother's beliefs to others?\n\nOn one hand, the author is hurt and acting from a place of anger and distress. On the other, sharing private family matters without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the mom's friends are gay, the author is revealing personal information about the mom's beliefs that she might not have shared herself. The friends might already know, but the author is confirming it explicitly. There's also the aspect of whether the mom's friends would want to know this through her child rather than her directly. \n\nThe author mentions that the mom \"would never say anything to them,\" implying that the mom hides her true beliefs from her friends. If the friends are unaware of her homophobia, the author is exposing her, which could be seen as protecting the friends from being in a toxic relationship. But if the friends are already aware, then maybe the author is just emphasizing it. \n\nThe key points are: the author's emotional state, the privacy of family matters, and the potential consequences for the mom's friendships. Even if the mom is wrong, is the author justified in revealing this? It's a gray area. Some might argue that the author has a right to defend themselves, especially if the mom is inconsiderate. Others might say that it's not their place to out someone else, even a parent. The answer hinges on whether the action was a necessary defense or an overreach. Given that the author is upset and acting out of spite, perhaps there's a tendency towards the former, making the author in the wrong.\n"
