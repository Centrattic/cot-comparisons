She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post did the wrong thing by telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mother reacted negatively to her child coming out, using religious reasons to reject them. The child, feeling hurt and powerless, then messaged the mother's gay friends to inform them about the mother's homophobia. The author is seeking validation on whether they were in the wrong (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author crossed a boundary by sharing their mother's private reaction with her friends. On one hand, the author was hurt and felt wronged, which is understandable. On the other hand, sharing someone else's private behavior, especially in a way that could damage relationships, might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy.\n\nConsiderations: \n1. **Privacy vs. Right to Express Hurt**: The author shared their experience with others, which is their right, but did they go too far by targeting the mother's friends? The mother's friends' relationship with her might be affected, and the author could be seen as interfering in their social circle.\n2. **Intent**: Was the author's message truthful or a malicious attack? They described the mother's homophobia accurately but used it to inform the friends about her behavior. However, doing this without the mother's consent might be crossing a line.\n3. **Impact**: The mother's friends might now have a negative view of her, which could lead to strained relationships. The author's action could be seen as spreading gossip or using the friends to get back at their mother.\n4. **Alternatives**: Could there have been a better way to handle the situation, like seeking support elsewhere without involving their mother's friends?\n\nIn many cultures, sharing family conflicts with others, especially about a parent's private views, is considered meddling. Even if the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's method of addressing it might be seen as inconsiderate towards their mother's relationships. However, the author's emotional state and feeling of being unsupported might also be taken into account as mitigating factors.\n\nSo, balancing the hurt and the potential harm caused to their mother's friendships, the author might be in the wrong for taking this action without considering the broader implications. The answer would likely be A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
