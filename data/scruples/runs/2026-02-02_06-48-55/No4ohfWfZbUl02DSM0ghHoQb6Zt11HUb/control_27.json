She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious rejection and disownment. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's rejection and homophobia, which led to the friends knowing about their mom's views.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author was hurt and upset, which is understandable. They reached out to their mom's friends, who are part of the LGBTQ+ community. The mom is described as a homophobe, but she's friends with other gay individuals, which is a bit contradictory. The author's message to these friends was both to inform them about their mom's rejection and possibly to vent their anger.\n\nIs this a betrayal of the mom's trust? The author is sharing family matters with others, which might be seen as gossiping or airing private family issues. But the mom had already excluded the author by not responding. However, the mom's friends are separate individuals, and the author might not have considered how this would affect their mom or the friends.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to protect their own mental health, but perhaps the method of dealing with it was not the best. Telling others about a parent's private views, even if those views are harmful, can be seen as crossing a boundary. The author's intent was partly to inform the friends about the mom's true beliefs, which might have been out of line since the mom's friends might already have their own opinions about her. \n\nAlso, the author might have a right to be upset, but sharing such information could lead to more conflict or damage relationships. The friends might feel betrayed if they had no idea their friend (the mom) was a homophobe. But the mom's actions are questionable too, as she's friends with gay individuals yet holds those beliefs.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have overstepped by sharing private family information, even if it was in a moment of anger. The mom's actions are harmful, but the author's response could be seen as spreading gossip or damaging someone's reputation. However, the mom's friends might deserve to know if they're being deceived by their friend's public image versus her private beliefs. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is protecting themselves and seeking support. On the other, they might be violating their mom's privacy. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But generally, sharing family issues without the parent's consent might be considered wrong, even if the parent is at fault. So the author is in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. However, since the options are A or B, the decision is whether to choose A or B based on the analysis.\n"
