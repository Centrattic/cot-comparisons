She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The situation involves the author coming out to their religious mother, who didn't accept them and cut off communication. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about their mother's homophobia.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author is upset and hurt, their mother is a homophobe, and the author shared this with her friends. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that. \n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the author's actions. They were emotionally distressed after being rejected by their mother. Their intention might have been to make their mom's friends aware of her behavior, possibly to hold her accountable or to find support. But does that justify sharing personal information about their mother without her consent?\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a vulnerable state, and their mom's friends are part of a community that the mom is judgmental about. The author might feel wronged and want their mom's friends to know the truth. But on the other hand, the author might have overstepped by airing family issues publicly, which could damage their mom's relationships and privacy. \n\nThe mom's friends might have their own way of dealing with her homophobia. By sharing this, the author could be causing harm to their mom's relationships without her consent. Even if the author's intention was to correct their mom's behavior, the method might be inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the author's mom might not have agreed to this information being shared. Respecting others' privacy is important, even if you disagree with their views. The author might have acted out of anger and hurt, which can cloud judgment. \n\nBut then again, the mom's actions are harmful and based on prejudice. The author might feel that exposing this behavior is justified to protect others from being hurt. However, the ethical question here is whether the author has the right to share personal family matters with others without consent. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, privacy and consent are important. Even if the mother is wrong, the author's method of addressing the issue by sharing it with her friends could be seen as violating her privacy. The author might have better alternatives, like seeking support elsewhere or confronting their mother directly, but sharing with her friends might be crossing a line. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared personal information about their mother without her consent, even if they were hurt. However, some might argue it's justified given the homophobia involved. But generally, sharing such information without consent is a breach of privacy, making the author at fault.\n"
