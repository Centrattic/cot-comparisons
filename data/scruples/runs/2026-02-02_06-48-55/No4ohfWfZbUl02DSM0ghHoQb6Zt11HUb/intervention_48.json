She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The mom was religious and didn't accept the person's sexuality, leading to some hurt and anger. The person then messaged the mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author did the right thing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to decide between A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The author was hurt and upset. They felt powerless and maybe acted out of spite. They told the mom's gay friends about the mother's rejection. The mom already had those friends, and she might have had conflicting beliefs\u2014being homophobic but having gay friends. The author's message could be seen as a way to expose the mom's hypocrisy or to share their pain. \n\nBut is that the right approach? Spreading such information could be seen as sharing private family matters with others, which might not be respectful. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author is essentially tattling or sharing personal family issues with friends. It might have been a way to express their hurt, but it's possible the author overstepped by involving others without considering the consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author felt so wronged that they needed support, and reaching out to others who are in similar situations (the mom's friends) could be seen as seeking solidarity. However, the author didn't approach their mom's friends directly to talk about it but instead told them what the mom believes, which could be a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nAnother angle: if the mom's friends knew she was homophobic, they might have known already, but the author's message could have forced them to confront that hypocrisy. However, the author's method of doing so by sending a message out of anger might not be constructive. It could damage relationships and make the mom's friends feel uncomfortable or involved in a family conflict they didn't ask to be part of. \n\nAlso, considering the intent: the author mentioned doing it partly out of anger and spite. Actions taken in anger can lead to regret, and in this case, sharing personal family issues with others might not be the best way to handle it. They might have been trying to validate their feelings or seek support, but it's possible they acted impulsively without considering the impact on others. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid and understandable given the situation, the action of informing the mother's friends could be seen as crossing a line. It's possible the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without considering the consequences, even if their intentions were hurtful. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
