She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The situation is that the mom is religious and didn't accept the author's being gay, leading to the author feeling hurt and then sending a message to the mom's gay friends about her being a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author came out and faced rejection. They felt hurt and powerless. Then, in a moment of anger and upset, they contacted the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nThe possible angles here are about privacy, intent, and the ethical implications of sharing someone's behavior with others. On one hand, the author might have felt wronged and wanted to inform people close to their mother about her stance. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by sharing personal family issues with others without the mother's consent.\n\nPrivacy is a big factor. The author's mother's views, even if negative, are part of her personal beliefs. Sharing this information with others could be seen as breaching her privacy. However, the friends are also gay, and the author might have felt that they have a right to know if their friend is being judgmental towards them.\n\nIntent matters too. The author did it partly out of spite and partly to inform the friends. If the intent was to protect others from the mother's homophobia, that might be more justifiable. But if it was primarily to get back at the mother, that's more self-serving and could be seen as the wrong decision.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. If the author's message led to the friends being hurt or if it caused unnecessary conflict, that's a negative outcome. But if it helped the friends be aware of the mother's true feelings, maybe it was a good thing. But the author's actions might have been impulsive and not the best way to handle the situation.\n\nAlso, considering family dynamics, the author might have felt isolated, but the response of informing third parties could be seen as not respecting their mother's privacy. The author could have sought support elsewhere, like contacting the friends directly for support or seeking counseling, instead of sharing the mother's negative comments.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, honesty is valued, but so is respect for privacy and not spreading gossip. The author's action might cross into gossip if it's not directly relevant to the friends unless the author was in a position to inform them. But since the friends might already have their own interactions with the mother, the author might not be the right person to mediate that.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information about their mother without her consent, possibly causing harm to their relationship and invading her privacy, even if the motivation was partly to inform others about the mother's homophobia. However, there's also a counter-argument that the author was trying to protect others from a judgmental person. But in most cases, sharing such personal family issues without consent is considered a breach of privacy, so the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, which is option A.\n"
