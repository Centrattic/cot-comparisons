She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The mom is religious and didn't take it well, saying things about Hell and not accepting the author's partner. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the mom is being homophobic, which is definitely wrong. The author is upset and feeling isolated. But by informing the mom's friends about her stance, the author might have betrayed the mom's trust. Even though the mom isn't being supportive, the author is sharing personal family issues with others. \n\nI need to consider if this is a breach of trust or if it's justified. The author's friends are also part of a marginalized group, and the mom is being judgmental towards them as well. Maybe the author felt they needed to protect their own mental health and also wanted to inform the friends about the mom's views. However, it's not clear if the friends were aware of their friend's homophobia. \n\nBut from a privacy standpoint, the author might have overstepped by sharing their mother's private reactions with others. Even if the mother isn't being supportive, the author's action could be seen as gossiping or spreading information without considering the consequences. The friends might feel hurt or upset if they find out their friend holds those views. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position. They might have felt that the friends could relate or offer support. But was it the right approach? Maybe the author should have sought support elsewhere instead of involving the mom's friends. The action could damage the mom's relationships with her friends, which isn't necessarily the author's place to mediate. \n\nSo, even though the mom's behavior is problematic, the author's action of informing the friends might be considered in the wrong because it's a breach of trust and privacy. The author's intention was understandable given the hurt, but the method wasn't appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
