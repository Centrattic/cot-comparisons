She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who was very religious and rejected them, even saying they'd go to hell. The mom stopped communicating. Then the author, feeling hurt and angry, told her friends (who are gay) that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author was wrong. So I need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author was hurt and wanted to protect themselves. Maybe they wanted to warn the other gay friends about their friend's views. But on the other hand, the mom's friends might have a right to know, but does the author have the right to out the mom's beliefs? Also, is this a betrayal of trust? The mom might consider her views private, even if they're harmful.\n\nBut wait, the author's mom's friends were already aware that she's religious and maybe have certain beliefs. But did the author have permission to share that info? Probably not. The author might be acting on anger and hurt, which could make the action impulsive. However, the mom's friends are part of the LGBTQ+ community, so maybe the author felt they had a duty to inform them, but that's a stretch. Spreading someone's private beliefs without their consent is usually considered a breach of privacy. Even if the content is negative, sharing it without permission is still a violation.\n\nSo, even though the author's mom is a homophobe, the act of sharing that information with others without her consent is likely wrong. The author isn't in the right because they didn't respect their mom's privacy, even if her actions were hurtful. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
