She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends about her rejection when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, rejecting them and not accepting their sexuality. The mom is religious and told the author they'd go to hell. Now, the author, feeling hurt and possibly in anger, reached out to the mom's gay friends to inform them about her stance, essentially spreading this information. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author's mom is a homophobe, and the author is upset. They contact the mom's friends (who are gay) to tell them that their friend is a homophobe. The author's intention might be to warn them or to get them to distance themselves, but the action is sharing personal information that the mom might not want public.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Spreading someone's personal views, even if those views are negative, without their consent can be problematic. Even if the mother's views are harmful, the author is sharing that information to the mother's friends, which could be seen as gossip or violating privacy. The author's mom might not want her opinions on sexuality to be shared with others, especially if it could affect her relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was hurt and possibly felt powerless. They might have thought that the friends should know the truth about their friend's stance on homosexuality. However, even if the mother's views are wrong, the author's method of addressing it by informing her friends could be seen as crossing a boundary. It's important to consider whether there are other ways to handle the situation, like setting boundaries without sharing personal information.\n\nAlso, the author's action might not address the root issue. The mom's rejection is the problem, and informing her friends might not help the author or their relationship with their parents. It could even escalate the situation or cause more harm to the author's family dynamics.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have a right to privacy, and sharing someone's personal views without their consent can be a breach of that right, even if the views are controversial. The author's intention here was to inform their mother's friends about her homophobia, but that doesn't necessarily mean the action was justified. The friends might have their own way of dealing with their friend's views, and the author's intervention could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using the mom's own friends' sexuality as a reason to spread this information. The mom is aware that her friends are gay, but the author is informing them of the mom's rejection. It's a form of using the friends' identity to spread the information, which might not be fair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action, while coming from a place of hurt, might be considered wrong because it involves sharing personal information without consent and could damage relationships. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
