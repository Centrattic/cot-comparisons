She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that the mom rejected them when they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who is very religious, and she reacted badly, saying they're going to hell and rejecting them. She's not responding to their messages. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, then told her gay friends (who are also the author's Facebook friends) about the mom's rejection and that she's a homophobe. The question is whether this was a wrong move.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's mom has friends who are gay, and the author told them about the mom's negative reaction. The author's motivation was partly in spite and to inform these friends about their friend's true beliefs.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Spreading someone's private reaction without their consent might be an invasion of privacy. The mom didn't ask the author to keep it secret, but the author revealed personal family matters. However, the mom's actions were hurtful and hypocritical (since she's friends with gay people but condemns them). \n\nOn one hand, the author was hurt and wanted to vent, maybe to protect their own feelings. On the other hand, sharing this information could damage the mom's relationships with her friends, even if her views are harmful. But the mom's friends already knew she was religious and possibly judgmental, so maybe the author was just being honest. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have felt justified because the mom was being hypocritical, and the friends deserved to know the truth. But is it the author's place to be the one to tell them? Or should the friends have confronted their friend directly?\n\nAlso, the author's action was an emotional reaction. Was it a betrayal of trust, even if the mom isn't a good person? People might have different opinions on whether the ends justify the means here. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong because the mother was the one being harmful, and the author was protecting themselves. In others, it's still a breach of privacy regardless of the mom's behavior. \n\nI think the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. But generally, sharing private family issues without consent is often seen as wrong, even if the subject is problematic. However, there's a case where the author was defending themselves and the friends might have a right to know their friend's true stance. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. If the answer is A (author is in the wrong), it's about respecting privacy and not gossiping. If B (not in the wrong), it's about the mother's hypocrisy and the author's self-advocacy. \n\nIn similar situations, people might argue both sides. But I think in most cases, even if the mother is at fault, the author's action could be seen as crossing a line. So probably A.\n"
