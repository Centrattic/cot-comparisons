She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative religious reaction. The mom cut off contact, and the author, in a fit of anger, told the mom's gay friends about her homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's mom is being homophobic, which is definitely wrong. But the author took it upon themselves to inform the mom's friends about her stance. On one hand, the author was hurt and sharing this might be a way to seek support or hold their mom accountable. On the other hand, sharing private family matters without consent could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action was justified. The mom's behavior was harmful, but did the author have the right to disclose that information to her friends? The friends might have been in a position where they knew their mutual friend was a homophobe but didn't act. By sharing, the author could be protecting themselves and possibly helping the friends make informed decisions about their relationships.\n\nHowever, the author did it out of anger and spite. Even if the intent was partly to inform, using someone's private family issues as a way to retaliate might not be the best approach. The mom might see this as a betrayal, but the author's primary issue is with the mom's homophobia. It's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points.\n\nI think the key factors here are intent and the nature of the disclosure. The author was upset and acting out of hurt. While the mom's behavior was wrong, the author's action might have been a form of self-defense in terms of transparency. But sharing personal family matters without consent could be seen as crossing a line, even if the reason is justified. So, it's a balance between standing up against injustice and respecting boundaries. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the mom's actions were harmful and the author was seeking to inform people who were also affected by her mom's homophobia.\n"
