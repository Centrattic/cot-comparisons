She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother reacted negatively, calling the author's partner illegitimate and being religious, threatening hell. The author was hurt and felt powerless. Their action was to inform the mother's gay friends about her homophobia. \n\nNow, the key points here are about the ethics of sharing someone else's private information. The author is essentially out someone's parent for being a homophobe to her friends. The mother's friends are gay, so the author might have thought they were targeted by the mother's beliefs. But is it right to expose someone's private beliefs without their consent?\n\nOn one hand, the author was upset and felt justified in defending themselves. The mother's actions were harmful, and the author might have felt that the friends needed to know the truth about her. But on the other hand, sharing private family matters without consent can damage relationships and trust. The author didn't have the right to out their mother's beliefs to others, even if those beliefs are harmful. It's a breach of privacy, even if the intent was to protect others from potential future issues.\n\nAlso, the author's action was in a moment of emotional distress, which might mitigate the judgment but doesn't absolve them entirely. The friends might have already known about the mother's views through other means, but the author's direct message could have been a betrayal. The mother's friends might have their own dynamics with her, and the author stepping in could be seen as interfering.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because sharing private family information without consent is generally not appropriate, even if the intent was to highlight the mother's harmful beliefs.\n"
