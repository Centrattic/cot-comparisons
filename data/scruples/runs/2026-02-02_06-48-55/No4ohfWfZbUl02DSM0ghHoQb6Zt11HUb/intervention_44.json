She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a very negative reaction, including saying they're going to hell and refusing to accept them or a future partner. The mom isn't responding, and this is hurting the author. In a moment of anger and upset, the author messaged their mom's gay friends, who are friends on Facebook, explaining the situation and that the mom is a homophobe. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe key points here are: sharing private family information, the emotional state of the author, and the potential harm caused to both the mother and the friends. \n\nOn one hand, the author was hurt and felt powerless. They might have felt the need to vent or warn the friends about the mom's true feelings. However, sharing such personal information without consent can be seen as a betrayal of trust. The mom's friends might not have wanted their relationship with her to be discussed in this way, even if they are also gay. The author's action could damage the mother's relationships with her friends, which is a consequence to consider.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly harmful and unacceptable. The author might feel that by sharing this, they're exposing the mom's hypocrisy\u2014since she has gay friends but condemns them. However, the right way to address hypocrisy isn't by spreading private family drama. The author could have sought support through other means, like talking to a counselor or support groups, instead of involving the mother's friends.\n\nAdditionally, the author's motivation was partly spite and anger. While understandable given the situation, acting on anger without considering the impact on others might be seen as impulsive and unkind. The friends might feel targeted or used as a way for the author to vent their anger.\n\nSo, the main ethical issues are privacy, honesty, and the manner of conflict resolution. The author didn't own the information to share the mom's reaction with others. Even if the mom's friends knew she was religious, the author's message could have been hurtful or damaging to her reputation. The friends might not appreciate being part of a family conflict they weren't involved in.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings and the mother's actions are problematic, the author crossed a line by sharing private information with the mom's friends. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
