She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about her homophobia is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious condemnation and rejection. The mom's actions were hurtful, and the person felt powerless. Then, the person told the mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia. The mom knows these friends are gay, even though she disapproves.\n\nThe key points here are: the person's motivation, the impact of their actions, and whether their actions were justified. The person was hurt and angry, which might be a mitigating factor. But did they overstep by spreading their mother's views to her friends?\n\nOn one hand, the mom's behavior is problematic. She's a homophobe and is rejecting her child. The person might feel they needed to inform others about her true beliefs, especially if those friends might not know. But on the other hand, the person is sharing private family matters without the mother's consent. Even if the information is true, sharing it with others could be seen as gossiping or betraying trust, especially within a family context.\n\nAlso, consider the relationship dynamics. The mom's friends might feel uncomfortable if they find out that the person who is close to the mom is actually in a marginalized group the mom disapproves of. The person might have thought they were protecting their own identity or seeking validation, but it's possible they crossed a line by involving others.\n\nAnother angle: is the person justified in feeling the need to warn the friends? If the mom's behavior could affect their friends, maybe the person thought it was a way to protect them. But the friends might have a right to privacy regarding their personal relationships and how they handle their friendships with the mom. The person's action could have caused tension or conflict without the friends' consent.\n\nMoreover, the person mentions that they were acting out of anger and spite. That could indicate a lack of clear thinking at the time. While understandable given the emotional state, it's a factor in whether the action was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and respecting boundaries. Even if the person believes their mom is wrong, sharing that information with others without her consent might not be their place. It's possible that the friends already knew about the mom's views or might have their own way of handling it. The person's intervention could be seen as inserting themselves into someone else's relationship.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the mom's behavior is harmful, and the person might be trying to create accountability. But the appropriate way to address that would be up to the friends, not the person. The person's action could be seen as taking matters into their own hands without considering the consequences for their mom and others involved.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the person likely is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were to expose their mom's hypocrisy or protect others. Their emotional state at the time might be a mitigating factor, but the action itself is a breach of trust and privacy.\n"
