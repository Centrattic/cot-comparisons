She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that the mom rejected them when they came out. The situation is that the mom is very religious, didn't take the coming out well, said some hurtful things, and now the author is upset. In their anger, they messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects here. The author is sharing a personal family matter with people who are friends with their mom. This seems like a breach of privacy. Even though the mom is the one being judgmental, the author is spreading their own parent's views to others, which can be seen as gossip or betrayal. The mom might have a right to her beliefs, even if they're harmful, and the author is taking it upon themselves to inform others about her.\n\nThe author's intention was partly to inform the friends but also out of spite. That's a red flag. When someone acts out of anger or revenge, it's usually not justified. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author's action could damage relationships between the mom and her friends. The friends might feel betrayed if they found out the author told them about the mom's beliefs without the mom's consent.\n\nAlso, the author's mom is part of a community (dog shows), and spreading this could lead to further conflict or judgment. The friends might now take sides, or the mom could face social repercussions she wasn't expecting. The author's action isn't helping their own situation; instead, it's causing more harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's reaction was indeed harmful. She rejected her child, used religious arguments to invalidate their identity, and stopped communication. The author was hurt and felt powerless. But does that justify the action? Probably not. There are healthier ways to deal with the emotions, like seeking support from other friends or therapists, rather than betraying their parent's trust.\n\nSo, considering all points: breach of privacy, acting out of spite, potential harm to relationships, and the existence of better coping mechanisms, the author is likely in the wrong. They should have handled their emotions differently instead of informing their mother's friends about her views. So the answer would be A.\n"
