      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting night duties for a baby when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. They don't see the need to split the overnight shifts since one parent is working every morning and the other isn't working for six weeks. The question is whether the author is at fault (AITA) for this opinion.\n\nI should consider common societal views on parental responsibilities. Typically, parental leave is meant to give the parent time to bond with the baby and manage early childcare. However, some might argue that shared responsibilities are better for both the parents and the child. But in this case, the working parent has to get up early for work, which might limit their availability. The parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that splitting the nights isn't necessary because the working parent is already up in the morning for work. They might be suggesting that the parent on leave should take the overnights so the working parent can get more rest. But others might counter that both parents should share the duties equally, regardless of work schedules, to maintain fairness in the relationship.\n\nI need to check if there's a general consensus on this. Some sources say that sharing duties can prevent resentment and ensure both parents are equally involved. However, practical considerations like work hours might make it logical for one parent to take more responsibilities temporarily. \n\nIn this case, the parent on leave has the time to dedicate to the baby, which could make their role more natural for overnight duties. The working parent might need more sleep to function well during their work hours. So the author's stance might be seen as practical rather than selfish.\n\nBut maybe the other parent might feel it's unfair if they're always up at night while the working parent gets to sleep. However, the author is arguing against splitting when it's not necessary. So if splitting isn't necessary due to the different work schedules, then the author isn't wrong in their reasoning.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasoning is based on practicality and the differing work circumstances of each parent.\n"
