      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle nighttime feedings. The situation involves splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave often allows the parent not working to focus on the baby without the stress of a job. If the working parent is up early for work, maybe they can't handle the middle-of-the-night feedings. The parent on leave might have more flexibility. But does that mean the working parent should get up? Or is it fair for the parent on leave to take over since they're not working?\n\nI should think about common practices. Sometimes, parents alternate or the one who can sleep longer is the one who gets up. If the parent on leave is already home and not working, maybe they can handle the feedings. However, it's also about physical recovery from childbirth. If the parent who gave birth is on leave, they might need rest. But the other parent might be working and also need rest. \n\nI think the key here is mutual agreement and what's best for the family's situation. If the author assumes the parent on leave should do all the overnights without discussing it, that could be problematic. But if they're suggesting it's logical for the parent on leave to take care of the baby during the night since they're not working, maybe that's a reasonable perspective. However, expecting the non-working parent to do all the overnights might not consider their need for rest as well. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the specific circumstances. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if they're making a general statement without considering the parent on leave's needs, they could be in the wrong. It's a shared responsibility, and assuming one parent should bear it all could be unfair. Hence, the author might be at fault for not considering the other parent's situation. But I'm a bit torn because sometimes practicality plays a role. Hmm.\n"
