      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking that when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to get up for work every morning.\n\nFirst, let me break down the scenario. There are two parents: one is on parental leave, so they're not working, and the other is working, needing to get up early each day. The question is about who should take care of the baby at night. The author's stance is that the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties because the working parent has to get up for work. But they're asking if that makes them the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, what's the general expectation here? Parental leave typically allows a parent to take time off work to care for their child. The parent on leave might have more flexibility to handle the baby's needs during the night. The other parent, who's working, might be more tired during the day and need to maintain their work schedule. \n\nHowever, parenting responsibilities are usually shared, and it's common for both parents to take turns, especially if the one on leave is already handling daytime duties. But in this case, the parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they can manage the night shifts. On the other hand, the working parent might need their sleep to be functional during the day. \n\nI think it's reasonable for the author to suggest that the parent on leave should handle the overnight feedings to allow the working parent to get enough rest. The working parent might not have the luxury of being up all night and still have to perform at work. The parent on leave can use that time to bond with the baby and adjust to the new schedule. \n\nBut some might argue that both parents should share the responsibility to promote equality and ensure both can get enough sleep. However, in this specific situation where one parent isn't working, maybe it's practical for the non-working parent to take the overnights. \n\nSo, am I in the wrong if I think that? I don't think so because the author's reasoning is based on the practical aspect of the working parent needing rest. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
