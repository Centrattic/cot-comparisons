      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and overnight responsibilities with a baby. The author is suggesting that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up at night, while the other parent, who's working, might not need to.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. Parental leave policies vary, but generally, when one parent is on leave, they might have more flexibility. But the question is about splitting overnight duties. The author thinks it's reasonable for the non-working parent to handle the night feedings or getting up, since the other parent has to go to work in the morning.\n\nBut is that fair? Well, some people might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally regardless of work schedules. Others might say that the parent who's not working can take on more nighttime duties because they're not tied to a work schedule. \n\nWait, but the baby's needs are crucial. If the working parent has to get up early, maybe they can adjust their schedule to get up with the baby so they can both sleep longer. Also, if the non-working parent is handling all the overnight duties, they might get less sleep, which isn't ideal either. \n\nBut then again, the parent on leave might have the opportunity to bond with the baby during the night. However, it's important to remember that both parents should ideally share the responsibilities. Maybe the author is assuming that the working parent can't or shouldn't get up because of work, but that might not consider the working parent's ability to adjust their routine. \n\nAnother angle: some parents might prefer the working parent to take over in the mornings to help with the baby before work, allowing the non-working parent to rest. But this situation is about nighttime. The key is whether it's fair to expect the non-working parent to handle all the night duties. \n\nI think there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on the family's circumstances and mutual agreement. However, the author is making an assumption that the non-working parent should bear the nighttime responsibilities, which might not consider the other parent's willingness or ability to help. If both parents are sharing equally, that's better for their well-being and the baby's. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering shared responsibility, even if one is working.\n"
