      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. The options are A for yes and B for no. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is suggesting that when one parent is on leave and the other is working, the parent on leave should handle the night feedings or waking up with the baby. The question is whether this is a fair expectation or if the author is in the wrong for thinking that.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they have more flexibility to stay up with the baby. That parent might be more available since they're not rushing to work. But on the other hand, parental leave can be a time for rest and bonding, and it's not necessarily fair to assume that parent should do all the night work. Both parents should share responsibilities, even if one is on leave. The working parent might have a valid point if they're tired from their job and need sleep to function the next day. Plus, taking turns might help both parents get used to caring for the baby, which is important for the child's well-being.\n\nAlso, the idea that the non-working parent should handle all nighttime duties could stem from traditional gender roles, which might not be the best approach. Modern parenting often emphasizes shared responsibilities regardless of who is working. So, if the author is insisting that the parent on leave should do all the night feedings without considering the other parent's needs or the mutual sharing of duties, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if they're just suggesting that the parent on leave might have the capacity to take on more during that period, it might be a reasonable approach. The key here is whether the author is being unfair or rigid in their expectation. Since the question is about splitting overnights, the author is arguing against splitting and instead suggesting the parent on leave should take it all. This might not be fair because the parent on leave might also be exhausted from caring for the baby all day. So, their argument could be seen as not considering the other parent's situation or the need for balance, which would mean they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
