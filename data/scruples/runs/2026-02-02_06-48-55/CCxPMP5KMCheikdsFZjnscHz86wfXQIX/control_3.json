      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. They mention that one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to go to work every morning. The author is asking if they're the a**hole for this viewpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general expectations around parental responsibilities. Parental leave typically allows a parent to take time off work to care for their newborn. The idea is to bond with the baby and manage the household during those early weeks. So if one parent is on leave, maybe they're expected to take on more of the night duties. But then again, both parents are equally responsible for the child, right? Splitting overnights might be considered fair if both parents are working similar schedules, but in this case, one is off work. \n\nI wonder if there's a cultural or societal norm here. In some places, it's common for the parent not working to handle more of the nighttime care. But does that mean it's fair? The parent on leave might already be sacrificing their career, so expecting them to do all the night shifts could be seen as unfair. They might need rest too. On the other hand, the working parent is already getting up for work, so maybe they should get more sleep. \n\nBut wait, the parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility. They could adjust their sleep schedule to accommodate the baby. However, the physical and emotional toll of lack of sleep is significant. If the parent on leave isn't getting enough rest, that could affect their well-being and ability to care for the baby. \n\nAlso, the question is about the author's stance. They're saying they don't understand splitting overnights in this scenario. So they believe the parent on leave should take the night shifts. Are they wrong to think that? If the other parent is working, they might need more sleep to function during the day. The parent on leave can take turns. But is it right to assign that responsibility solely to them without considering their needs?\n\nAnother angle: parental leave is meant to allow both parents to bond with the baby. If the parent on leave is up all night, they might not have the energy to engage with the baby during the day. The working parent, while busy during the day, might miss out on bonding time if they're not involved at night. So maybe splitting the duties could help both parents bond, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut the parent on leave might not have the same commitments as the working parent. They can adjust their schedule to take the night shifts. It's a matter of fairness and mutual agreement. The author is suggesting that splitting overnights isn't necessary here, but others might argue that both parents should share the load regardless of work schedules. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective might stem from a practical standpoint: the working parent needs rest for their job, and the stay-at-home parent can handle the night shifts. But others might see it as unfair to the parent on leave. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not imposing this but is just questioning the fairness of splitting overnights in this specific scenario, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's their opinion, and it's based on the given circumstances. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
