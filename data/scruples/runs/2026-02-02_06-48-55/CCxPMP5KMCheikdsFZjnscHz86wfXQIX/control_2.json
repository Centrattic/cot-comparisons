      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is confused about splitting the overnight duties when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices and societal norms around parental leave and childcare. In many cases, the parent on leave might have more flexibility to handle nighttime duties since they don't have to work the next day. The working parent might need more sleep to function well at work.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of shared responsibility. Some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, even if one is on leave. However, practical considerations like work schedules and physical stamina could influence this. The parent on leave might be more rested and available to take care of the baby, which could be beneficial for the working parent's productivity and mental health.\n\nI should also think about the well-being of the parents. If the working parent is exhausted from getting up at night, it could affect their job performance and stress levels. On the other hand, the parent on leave might need the rest to stay healthy and engaged during the day.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on the family's specific circumstances, their agreement, and what works best for them. The author's question is whether their belief is wrong. Since there's no universal right or wrong in such personal situations, the answer might hinge on whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since the author is considering the practical aspect of work schedules, it's a reasonable stance. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
