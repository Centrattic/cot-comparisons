      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working. The author thinks the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties because they're not working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common expectations. Parental leave is usually about allowing the parent to bond with the baby and share the responsibilities. However, the other parent is busy with work, so maybe they need rest to perform well at their job. \n\nBut the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take over the nights. That might be expected in some families, but it's not a universal rule. Each family might have different arrangements based on their needs. The parent on leave might have already been doing most of the daytime work, so expecting them to do the nights too could be overwhelming. \n\nOn the other hand, shared responsibilities can help both parents adjust and bond with the baby. If the working parent doesn't participate in nighttime care, they might miss out on that bonding time. Also, the parent on leave might need their rest too, especially if they're handling most of the childcare during the day.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that way. The answer depends on whether this expectation is fair. Some might argue that the parent on leave should take the night shifts since they're not working, but others might say it's important for both parents to share equally. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is making an assumption without considering the other parent's perspective. The parent on leave might be juggling a lot already, but equally, the working parent might need their rest. The right approach would be for them to communicate and find a solution that works for their specific situation. Since the author is making a judgment without context, they might be in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
