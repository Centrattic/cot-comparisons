      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a situation is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night, especially when the other parent is working and has to get up early in the morning. The author questions splitting the overnights in this case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Parental leave typically means one parent is off work to care for the child. The idea is to give both parents time to bond with the baby and manage the responsibilities of a newborn. However, there's a common belief that the parent on leave should take on more nighttime duties so the working parent can rest and be more alert for work the next day. \n\nBut is it necessarily the case that the parent on leave must take all the overnights? Maybe the couple has different circumstances. For example, if the working parent has a night shift, or if the other parent is also available and wants to share the load. Also, the physical and mental health of both parents matters. If the parent on leave is already exhausted from being the primary caregiver during the day, getting up all night might not be fair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that. The author's reasoning might be that the parent not working can afford to stay up, while the working parent needs rest. But others might argue that both parents should share the responsibility regardless of work status. It could depend on cultural norms, the family's agreement, or individual situations. \n\nSo, is there a right or wrong here? It's possible that the author is not in the wrong, as their perspective is common. However, assuming that the parent on leave is solely responsible might be an unfair assumption, especially if there's no prior agreement. Without more context, it's hard to say. But if the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for that opinion, maybe the answer is B (No), because it's a personal choice and varies by family dynamics. Alternatively, A (Yes) if it's seen as an imposition or not considering the other parent's needs. \n\nI should consider typical responses to AITA questions. Often, they look for fairness and mutual consideration. If the couple agreed to split the overnights, then the author's suggestion might not be the right approach. But if there's no such agreement, maybe it's reasonable. However, the author is implying that splitting overnights is not appropriate when one is on leave, which could be seen as a valid point. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
