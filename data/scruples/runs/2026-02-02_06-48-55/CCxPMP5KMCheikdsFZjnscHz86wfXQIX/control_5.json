      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to go to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around parental leave and nighttime duties. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they might take on more childcare responsibilities, including night feedings. This allows the working parent to get more rest for their job. But there are exceptions based on individual circumstances, like physical health, mental health, or previous agreements between the parents.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the parent not working should handle the overnights since the other has work in the morning. That seems logical because the working parent needs to be rested for their job. However, some might argue that both parents should share responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nLooking at societal norms and practical considerations, many experts suggest that the non-working parent should take over night duties to allow the working parent to rest. This helps in maintaining the working parent's job performance and reduces stress. However, if the non-working parent is also dealing with postpartum recovery or other challenges, it's important to adjust accordingly.\n\nIn this case, the author is justifying their stance based on the work schedule. Unless there are other factors affecting the non-working parent's ability to handle overnight duties, the author's perspective seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're making a practical consideration based on the parent's work commitments.\n"
