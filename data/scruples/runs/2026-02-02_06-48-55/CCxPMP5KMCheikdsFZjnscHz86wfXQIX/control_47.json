      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about dividing overnight responsibilities with a baby when one parent is on parental leave. The author thinks the parent on leave should be the one dealing with the night feedings, since the other parent has to get up for work.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider different perspectives. Parental leave is usually intended to give a parent time to bond with the baby and manage childcare, so maybe the parent not working could be expected to take on more of the night duties. On the other hand, the parent on leave might be exhausted from caring during the day, so switching might be fair. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave should handle the overnight because the working parent needs to be rested for work. That seems logical from a practical standpoint. However, some might argue that both parents should share the load equally regardless of work schedules. \n\nBut is there a cultural or societal norm here? In some places, it's common for the parent not working to manage night feeds. Also, the parent on leave might have more flexibility to adjust their schedule. However, it's important to note that each family's situation is different. Some might prefer alternating to ensure both parents get rest. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's expectation is unreasonable. If the parent on leave voluntarily agreed to take on more responsibilities, then the author's stance isn't wrong. If there's an expectation of equal sharing despite different work schedules, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But traditionally, when one parent is on leave, they often take on more childcare duties. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a practical argument based on work schedules. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
