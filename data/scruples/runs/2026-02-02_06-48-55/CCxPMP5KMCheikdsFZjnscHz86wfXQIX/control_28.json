      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) for thinking that.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. There are two parents. One is on parental leave, so they're not working, and the other has to go to work every morning. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the night feedings and getting up with the baby, while the working parent can sleep through the night since they don't have to get up as early. But the other parent might be arguing for splitting the nights, maybe to share the responsibility equally.\n\nNow, I need to consider different perspectives. From a fairness standpoint, some might say that both parents should share the responsibilities, even if they're not working. However, the parent on leave might need to get up earlier for feedings and then still have the whole day to take care of the baby. The working parent, on the other hand, might be exhausted from their job and need more rest to function the next day. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of how parental leave works. The parent on leave is there to bond with the baby and take on more childcare duties. It's possible that the author is suggesting that the parent who is home should naturally take on those night duties since they're not working. But others might argue that it's unfair to expect the parent on leave to do all the work, especially if the other parent is also a parent and should share the load.\n\nAnother angle is the physical and mental health of both parents. Constantly getting up at night can be tiring. If the working parent already has a demanding job, getting no sleep might affect their performance and well-being. Conversely, the parent on leave might be dealing with the stress of early parenthood and also the fatigue from lack of sleep. \n\nThere's also the possibility of differing expectations between the parents. The working parent might feel that because they are not on leave, they should be able to sleep, while the parent on leave is expected to handle more. But maybe the parent on leave is already doing a lot during the day, so adding night duties could be overwhelming. \n\nI should also think about common practices. In many cultures, there's an expectation that the parent who is home takes on more of the childcare, including night feedings. However, this can vary, and some families choose to split responsibilities regardless of work schedules. It's also possible that the working parent is not able to get up in the middle of the night because they have to be up early for work and wouldn't be able to get enough rest. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's reasoning is that since one parent is on leave and the other is working, the on-leave parent should take care of the baby at night. Whether this is fair or not depends on the specific circumstances and the agreement between the parents. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but the author is not necessarily in the wrong. Their perspective is based on the idea that the parent not working can afford to give up sleep, while the working parent needs rest for their job. However, others might argue for equal sharing. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often expect both parents to share equally, but the reality can be more complex. The author's stance is a common viewpoint, especially if the other parent is working. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
