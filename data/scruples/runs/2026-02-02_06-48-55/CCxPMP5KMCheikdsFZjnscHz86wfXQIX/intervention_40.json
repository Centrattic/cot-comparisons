      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is suggesting that if one parent is on leave and the other is working, the non-working parent should take the nighttime duties. The reasoning is that the working parent is up early for work anyway. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. Parental leave is supposed to allow a parent to bond with the baby and share the responsibilities. If the working parent is up early for work, maybe they can handle some of the early morning duties, but nighttime feedings might still be more manageable for the non-working parent who is at home all day. However, this can vary based on individual circumstances, like the parents' energy levels, the baby's schedule, and their own preferences.\n\nAnother angle is that splitting duties can help both parents get rest, but if one parent is already on leave, they might have more flexibility. But the working parent might be more tired from work and need rest. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. The question is whether the author's stance is wrong.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the non-working parent is getting up at night, they might not get enough rest either. Some people might argue that both parents should share the nighttime duties if possible, but practicality plays a role. The author's assumption that the non-working parent should take on this role might not account for all factors.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on context. If the non-working parent is already handling the majority of daytime duties, adding nighttime could be overwhelming. On the other hand, the working parent might have a more demanding schedule. There's no universal right or wrong here. The author's position might be based on a practical approach, but it's not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the situation varies and the author's reasoning isn't inherently incorrect.\n"
