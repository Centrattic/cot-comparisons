      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to go to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspectives on this. Parental leave usually allows one parent to take time off work to care for the newborn. The parent on leave might have more flexibility, while the working parent has to be up early for work. So, the idea that the non-working parent should handle the night feedings makes sense because they can take turns without the pressure of needing to be up early. \n\nHowever, this isn't a universal rule. Every family has different circumstances. Maybe the parent on leave is exhausted or has other responsibilities. Also, some parents prefer to share the duties regardless of work schedules. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for this opinion. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that splitting nights isn't fair when one parent needs to be up for work. This is a common argument. The parent on leave can adjust their sleep schedule more easily, while the working parent needs to be rested for the next day. So, expecting the working parent to get up at night might lead to them being more tired during the day. \n\nBut should the author be in the wrong? Well, suggesting that the parent on leave should take over nights isn't necessarily wrong. It's a valid perspective based on practical considerations. However, it's also important to recognize that some parents might feel they should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit often looks at whether the person's actions or opinions are unreasonable. The author is expressing a viewpoint, not necessarily doing something harmful. Unless there's a specific context where this is causing conflict, the author's opinion is just that\u2014a personal view. \n\nIn many cases, families do adjust so that the working parent gets to sleep more. So the author isn't wrong for thinking that. However, if the situation is causing resentment or one parent is being forced to take all the nights, that's different. But based on the given information, the author's reasoning seems logical. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
