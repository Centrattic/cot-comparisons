      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author also mentions that splitting overnights doesn't make sense when one parent is working every morning and the other is on leave for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental responsibilities can be a sensitive topic. The author's point is that the parent not working should handle the middle-of-the-night feedings or care, allowing the working parent to rest for their job. But is that a fair assumption?\n\nOn one hand, the parent on leave isn't tied to a strict work schedule, so they might have more flexibility to adjust their sleep. This could be practical because the working parent needs to be alert for their job. However, parenting often requires teamwork. Sharing responsibilities, even if one parent is on leave, can help build a stronger bond between both parents and the child. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that the parent on leave is still working in a different capacity\u2014raising the child. So expecting them to take on all the night duties might be unfair. Also, both parents might be exhausted, and sleep deprivation can affect anyone, regardless of their current job status. \n\nAnother angle: cultural or societal norms vary. In some cultures, it's expected that the non-working parent handles more night duties, while others push for equality. The question is whether the author's expectation is reasonable. If the working parent is completely off the hook, that might create resentment later when the leave ends. But if the parent on leave is also handling all the night shifts, that could lead to burnout.\n\nThe key here is that the situation is unique to each family. What works for one might not work for another. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong, but it depends on the family's agreement and circumstances. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is insisting that it's a given that the parent on leave should handle all night duties without considering the other parent's input or the potential for shared responsibility, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if they are just expressing their opinion, it's a matter of perspective.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being rigid or if they're open to negotiation. Since the question is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering that parental responsibilities should ideally be shared based on mutual agreement and what works for the family, the author's assumption might not be wrong, but it's not necessarily right either. However, the fact that they are asking if they're in the wrong suggests they might be aware of possible inflexibility. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're voicing a common practical approach. However, if the other parent isn't involved in the discussion, that could be problematic. Since the scenario doesn't mention any conflict yet, just the author's opinion, the answer might be that they aren't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. The correct answer might be A or B. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B. Hmm.\n"
