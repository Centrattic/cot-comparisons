      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The parent is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this belief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of parental leave. Typically, the parent taking leave is not working, so their schedule is more flexible. The other parent is going back to work each day. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave has more free time and can handle the night feeds without needing to be up early for work. \n\nBut wait, is that a fair assumption? Parental leave is meant to allow both parents to bond with the baby and share responsibilities. However, if one parent is working, they might be more tired from the workday and need rest. On the other hand, the parent on leave is already not working, so maybe they can manage the night feeds. But does that mean it's fair to assign all the night duties to them?\n\nI should consider the physical and emotional toll. Night feeds can be exhausting, and if the parent on leave is already doing most of the daytime work, adding night duties could lead to burnout. Also, the working parent might feel guilty or want to share the load. Sharing the night duties could help both parents bond with the baby and share the responsibility.\n\nBut some might argue that the parent on leave is the one who can adjust their schedule more easily. However, if the parent on leave is handling the night feeds, they might not get enough rest either. The key here is that parenting responsibilities should be shared equitably, regardless of work schedules. The idea that one parent should automatically take on more because they have the time might not be fair. Both parents should communicate and find a balance that works for their specific situation.\n\nThe original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author believes the parent on leave should handle the night feeds because the other parent is working. The answer would depend on whether this belief is seen as unfair. Since parenting duties should ideally be shared and considering the potential for burnout, the author's assumption might be seen as not considering the parent on leave's well-being and the importance of shared responsibility. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not advocating for a balanced approach.\n"
