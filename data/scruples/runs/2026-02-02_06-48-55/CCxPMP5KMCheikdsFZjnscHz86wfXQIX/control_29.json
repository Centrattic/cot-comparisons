      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night.\n\nThe author is saying they think the parent on leave should be the one handling the middle-of-the-night feedings. The other parent is working every morning, so they have to be up early. The author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for that opinion.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the general norms around parental responsibilities. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they might take on more childcare duties, including overnight. But it's not a strict rule. Some families split the nights, but here the author argues against that because the working parent needs to be up early.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is fair. The parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more flexibility. The working parent needs to get to work, so staying up all night could affect their productivity. But the parent on leave is already off work, so they can adjust their schedule. However, sleep deprivation is a real issue for both parents. \n\nBut the author's argument is that splitting the overnights is unnecessary when one parent is already not working. That makes sense because the working parent needs to get enough sleep to function during the day. The parent on leave can handle the night duties since they don't have to be up early. \n\nIs there any reason why the author would be in the wrong? Well, maybe not. It's logical to prioritize the working parent's need for sleep. Also, the parent on leave has more free time to manage the nighttime care. So the author's reasoning is practical. \n\nI don't see a clear wrong here. The author is making a reasonable point based on the parents' schedules. Unless there are other factors (like the parent on leave also needs rest for future responsibilities or healthcare reasons), the author isn't in the wrong. They're suggesting a division of labor that makes sense given the circumstances. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
