      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is suggesting that if one parent is on leave and the other has to go to work in the morning, then the parent on leave should take the overnight duties. The question is whether this is a fair expectation.\n\nParenting responsibilities can be subjective. Some people argue that parents should share duties equally, while others think practical factors like work schedules should influence the division of tasks. The parent on leave might be available to take care of the baby at night, allowing the working parent to rest and be more alert for work. On the other hand, some might say that both parents should share the load regardless of work schedules to maintain equality and prevent burnout for the parent on leave.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, practicality, and mutual agreement. If both parents agree and the parent on leave is comfortable with taking over the overnight duties, then it's a matter of their arrangement. However, if the author is insisting this is the only right way without considering the other parent's feelings or circumstances, that could be problematic. The parent on leave might also need rest to manage the daytime responsibilities. If they're up all night, they might become exhausted, affecting their ability to care for the baby during the day.\n\nAdditionally, societal views on parenting roles vary. Some cultures or individuals prioritize sharing all duties equally, while others prioritize practicality. The answer might depend on the specific dynamics of the couple and their agreement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, suggesting that expecting the parent on leave to take all the overnights is unfair. But I need to consider if there's a general consensus here. If the parent on leave voluntarily takes it, maybe it's okay. However, if it's imposed without discussion, it could be seen as unfair. The post doesn't mention whether there's mutual agreement.\n\nIn summary, the answer hinges on whether the author's stance is based on mutual agreement and practicality or an assumption that the parent on leave must take over the night duties. Without more context, it's a bit tricky, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion. If they're advocating for fairness based on work schedules, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're dismissing the other parent's needs, then they might be. However, the post is asking for a general opinion, not a specific case.\n"
