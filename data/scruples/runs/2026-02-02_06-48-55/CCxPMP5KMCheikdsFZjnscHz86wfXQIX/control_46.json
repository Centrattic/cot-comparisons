      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is saying they think the parent on leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. The other parent is working and needs to get up early for work. The author is questioning if they're at fault for this opinion.\n\nI should consider the norms around parental leave and sleep responsibilities. Typically, parental leave is a time when the parent isn't working can take on more childcare duties, including nighttime feedings. This might be to help the working parent rest so they can manage their work schedule. However, it's also important to consider the well-being of both parents. The parent on leave might be equally tired, especially if they're also managing other daytime responsibilities.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that splitting overnights isn't fair when one parent is working. They're suggesting the non-working parent should handle the night duties. Is that a common viewpoint? Some people might agree that the parent not working should handle the night shifts to allow the working parent to get enough rest for their job. Others might argue that both parents should share the load to support each other, regardless of work schedules.\n\nI should also think about cultural expectations. In some cultures, the parent not working is expected to take on more childcare, including nighttime tasks. However, in other cases, there's a push for equality, even if it means the working parent sacrifices some sleep. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances and what the parents agree on.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're advocating for the parent on leave to handle the night shifts, is that a reasonable stance? It could be seen as reasonable if the goal is to let the working parent rest. However, it's also possible that this could add to the parent on leave's fatigue, especially if they're already managing the daytime care. The key here is whether the author's position is considered fair or not.\n\nIn many cases, people might agree that the working parent needs rest for their job, so the parent on leave taking over nights is acceptable. Therefore, the author's position might not be in the wrong. However, if the parent on leave is already overwhelmed, expecting them to take all the nights could be unfair. But the question doesn't mention any issues with the parent on leave's capacity, just the split of overnights.\n\nSo, considering the information given, the author's reasoning is based on the idea that the parent not working should handle the night duties to let the working parent rest. If that's a common viewpoint, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
