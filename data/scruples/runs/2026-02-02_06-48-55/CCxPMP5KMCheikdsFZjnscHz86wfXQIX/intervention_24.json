      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's reasoning is that the parent not working can handle the night shifts since they don't have to get up for work in the morning. That makes sense because the working parent might be more tired after a day job. But some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. \n\nParenting roles can vary a lot. In some families, they take turns, while others might have different arrangements. The key here is whether the author's logic is valid. If the non-working parent is available and the working parent needs rest for their job, then splitting based on work schedules could be practical. However, expecting the non-working parent to take all the night shifts might lead to burnout or an imbalance in responsibilities.\n\nAlso, cultural norms and the family's specific circumstances matter. If both parents agreed to this arrangement, maybe it's fair. But if there's an expectation of equal sharing without considering the work demands, that's different. The question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since the author is suggesting a practical approach based on work schedules, it's not inherently wrong. However, it's important to acknowledge that both parents might need support and that rigid roles can sometimes be limiting. \n\nIn the end, it's a nuanced situation. The answer might depend on the family's agreement and how they handle their responsibilities. Since the author is not forcing the other parent but suggesting a logical split, they might not be in the wrong. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground where flexibility is key.\n"
