      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent has to go to work every morning and the other is off for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on parental leave and responsibilities. Typically, parental leave is intended to give a parent time to bond with the baby and handle childcare duties. If one parent is on leave, they might be expected to take on more childcare responsibilities, especially since they're not working. The working parent might be more tired from the day job, so it could make sense for the non-working parent to handle nighttime duties.\n\nBut I should also think about the other side. Some might argue that both parents should share the load equally regardless of work status. However, the key here is that the parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility. The working parent is already up early for work, so getting up again at night could be more disruptive. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of rest. The working parent might need more sleep to function during the day. The parent on leave, not having a job, might have more time to adjust to the baby's schedule. So, in that case, the author's reasoning seems logical. \n\nBut is there a cultural or societal expectation here? In some places, it's traditional for the mother to take on more night duties, but that's changing. However, the question isn't specifying gender, just parental leave. So maybe it's more about the practicality of work schedules.\n\nI should also consider that the parent on leave might be the one who chose to take the leave, so they might have anticipated more involvement in nighttime care. The working parent, on the other hand, is balancing work and some childcare. \n\nSo, the author's stance is that the parent on leave should take over the night feedings or get-ups, which makes sense because they're not working. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for this opinion.\n"
