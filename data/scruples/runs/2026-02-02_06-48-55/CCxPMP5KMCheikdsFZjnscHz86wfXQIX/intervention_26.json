      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night.\n\nThe author is suggesting that the parent on parental leave should handle the nighttime duties, while the other parent, who's still working, should sleep. The question is whether this is the right approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices. In many families, especially when one parent is on leave, they might take turns or share responsibilities. But the author is arguing that the non-working parent should be the one up, so the working parent can get more rest for their job. That makes sense from a practical standpoint because the working parent needs to be alert for work the next morning.\n\nHowever, parental responsibilities often require teamwork. Maybe the parent on leave wants to bond with the baby and contribute by taking some nights. Or maybe they're both trying to balance their energy levels. The author's reasoning is logical, but does that mean they're in the right?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if there's a cultural or social norm that supports the author's view. In some cultures, the parent not working might be expected to handle more childcare duties during the day and night. But in others, partners might split it equally regardless of work status.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of fairness and mutual agreement. If both parents agree that the working parent should sleep and the non-working parent should take the nights, then it's their choice. But if one parent feels they're being unfair, then it could be a point of contention. The author's question is whether they're in the wrong for thinking that way.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's reasoning is practical but might overlook the partner's needs or desires. Parenting is a team effort, and assuming one parent should take all the nights might not be fair. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be seen as a valid perspective (B). But given that the user thinks A is correct, maybe A is the answer here.\n"
