      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices and societal norms. Parental leave is often taken by the parent who is not working, so they might have more flexibility to handle nighttime duties. However, it's also important to consider that both parents should share responsibilities equally. But in this case, the working parent has to get up for work in the morning, so maybe it's logical for the non-working parent to take over nighttime feedings or care to let the working parent rest. \n\nHowever, some might argue that both parents should share the load, even if one is on leave. But given the situation where one parent is already dealing with work in the morning, it might make sense for the non-working parent to handle the nights. But does that mean the author is in the wrong for thinking that way? \n\nThe answer depends on whether splitting the overnights is necessary. If the working parent is exhausted from work and needs sleep, perhaps the non-working parent should take more responsibility. However, expecting the non-working parent to do all the night duties might be placing an unequal burden, especially if they are also adjusting to being new parents. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author thinks the parent on leave should take the overnights. Is that a reasonable expectation? Well, since the working parent is already up in the morning, maybe the non-working parent can handle the night. But some might argue that both should share, regardless of work schedules. \n\nIn many cases, parents do split nighttime duties, but if one is working, they might need more rest. So the author's reasoning might be valid. However, in terms of fairness, maybe expecting the non-working parent to do all the nights isn't fair. But I'm not sure. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the situation is more nuanced. The answer might be A (Yes) if the author is wrong for not considering shared responsibility, or B (No) if the author is right given the work schedule. I need to decide based on typical family dynamics and expectations. In many families, the parent not working does take more night duties to allow the working parent to rest. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. But if the question is about the author's perspective being wrong, perhaps the answer is B. Wait, but the user says they think the author is in the wrong. The user might be expecting A, but maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, maybe there's no right or wrong, but the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because expecting the non-working parent to do all the overnights might not consider their own workload or the need for both parents to share equally. But if the working parent needs sleep, maybe it's okay. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. But in reality, many parents split duties based on work schedules. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The AITA question is from the author's perspective. If the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the non-working parent should do the nights, and if the common response is that the author is not wrong, then answer is B. If the common response is that the author is wrong, then A. Given that the user initially thought A, but I'm leaning towards B because of work schedules. So, final answer B.\n"
