      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the night feedings. The other parent is working and has to get up early in the morning. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking that way.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. On one hand, the working parent might be exhausted from a full day at work and need rest. If they have to get up at night, they might not get enough sleep, which could affect their job performance. On the other hand, the parent on leave might have more flexibility and time to care for the baby, especially since they're not working. \n\nThere's also the aspect of equal parenting. Some people believe both parents should share the responsibilities, even at night. But others argue that the parent not working should take on more of the nighttime duties to allow the working parent to rest. \n\nI should check if there are any cultural or societal norms that might influence this. In some cultures, the mother is expected to handle more nighttime duties, but others encourage equal sharing. However, the question doesn't specify the parent's gender, so it's better to keep it neutral.\n\nThe key here is the reasoning. The author's logic is that the parent on leave has the time, so they should handle the overnight duties. This could be seen as reasonable because the working parent needs to be alert for work. However, some might argue that both parents should contribute equally regardless of work schedules. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take over, it's a valid perspective. It's not necessarily wrong to prioritize the working parent's need for rest. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, others might think it's unfair to the non-working parent who is also a parent and should share the load. \n\nBut since the parent on leave isn't working, they might have more capacity. So the author's position is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
