      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take over the nighttime duties, especially since the other parent is going to work in the morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of parental leave. Typically, when one parent is on leave, they might take on more responsibilities at home, including caring for the baby. The author's reasoning is that the parent not working can handle the overnight feedings, allowing the working parent to rest for their job. \n\nBut is that fair? It depends on the couple's agreement and their circumstances. Some might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. Others might see it as practical to let the non-working parent handle the overnight duties so the other can function at work. \n\nHowever, assuming the parent on leave is willing and able to take on that role, it's a mutual decision they make. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this. The key here is that the author is making a judgment about how responsibilities should be split, which might not consider the other parent's preferences or the possibility of shared duties. \n\nIf the author is suggesting it's unfair for the working parent to have to get up, they might be in the right if they're both sharing equally. But if the parent on leave is voluntarily taking over, then maybe not. The post is asking for opinions, so the answer hinges on societal norms and whether the author's perspective is valid. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a common arrangement for the non-working parent to handle the overnight shifts. So the answer would be B.\n"
