      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author argues that splitting the overnights isn't fair when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave policies vary, but generally, the parent not working might have more flexibility. However, sleep deprivation is a big issue for new parents. If the working parent has to get up early for work, they might already be exhausted from lack of sleep, making it harder to function during the day. On the other hand, the parent on leave might have more time to adjust to the baby's schedule and help build a bond. But is it fair to assign all the night duties to them?\n\nAnother angle: some people might think it's unfair to expect the stay-at-home parent to do all the night feedings, especially if they're also managing other responsibilities. But others might argue that the working parent needs their rest to perform at work, which is crucial for the family's financial stability.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, the mother is expected to take more nighttime duties, but this is changing as more fathers take on leave. The situation might depend on the specific circumstances of the parents involved, like who chose to take leave, any prior agreements, or their physical and emotional states.\n\nThe user's initial thought was that the author is in the wrong. They might be considering that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. However, if the parent on leave can handle the night feedings better, maybe it's more practical. But expecting one parent to do all the work could lead to resentment.\n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting nights equally might not be feasible if one parent has to wake up early. Maybe a compromise is needed, like alternating nights or adjusting based on who is more rested. But the author's question is about whether they're in the wrong for thinking the on-leave parent should take it. If the other parent is working and needs rest, maybe the author's stance isn't entirely wrong. But if the parent on leave is already handling most daytime duties, adding nights could be overwhelming.\n\nI think the answer might be that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the working parent's need for rest is important. However, some might argue that shared responsibility is key. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
