      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is confused about splitting night duties when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices. Parental leave is meant to give the parent time to bond with the baby and help with early care. The parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more availability to handle overnight duties. However, some people believe parents should share responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules.\n\nBut the key point here is that the parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more flexibility. The other parent has to get up for work, which could be more tiring. It's about balancing the need for rest for the working parent and the availability of the parent on leave. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of fairness. If both parents are equally sharing responsibilities, maybe the on-leave parent can take the night shifts. However, every family's situation is different. Some might have health issues or other factors that affect who gets up. But the question doesn't mention any such exceptions.\n\nSo, in general, it's reasonable to think the parent not working should handle the night feedings. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
