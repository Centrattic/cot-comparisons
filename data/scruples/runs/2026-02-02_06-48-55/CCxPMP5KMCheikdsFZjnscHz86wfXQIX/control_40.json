      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The scenario is that one parent is on leave for six weeks and the other is working, so they're splitting overnight duties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices around parental leave and night responsibilities. Traditionally, there's been an assumption that the parent not working (on leave) might take more nighttime care. But modern views often emphasize shared responsibility, regardless of work schedules. However, the working parent has to get up early for work, which might make getting up at night more disruptive for them. The non-working parent might have more flexibility.\n\nBut is there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. Some might argue that the parent on leave isn't working, so it's more feasible for them to take the night shifts. Others might say it's unfair to make one parent do all the nighttime care, even if they're not working, because it's tiring and can lead to resentment. Also, physical exhaustion from lack of sleep is a factor for both parents.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author believes the parent on leave should take the nights. That's a valid opinion, but does it make them in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the couple agreed on splitting duties, but the author is insisting on this arrangement without considering the other parent's feelings, maybe. But if they're just stating their opinion, then it's not inherently wrong. There's no right answer here, so the answer might be \"No, the author is not in the wrong.\"\n"
