      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave. The author thinks that the parent on leave should take over the night duties because they're not working, while the other parent has to get up for work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general expectations around parental leave and nighttime duties. Parental leave is often meant to allow a parent to bond with the baby and share in the responsibilities, but it's also a time when that parent might be adjusting to their new role. However, if one parent is working full-time, they might be more tired from their job and thus less able to handle night feeds. On the other hand, the parent on leave might have more flexibility in their schedule and more time to dedicate to the baby during those early, sleepless weeks.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of equal parenting. Some people believe that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, even if one is on leave. However, practical considerations like work schedules can affect this. If the working parent needs to get up early for work, they might be less rested if they also have to get up during the night, which could affect their performance and well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the physical and mental health of both parents. The parent on leave might be dealing with postpartum recovery or other challenges, and taking on all the night duties could add stress. However, it's also about teamwork and making sacrifices for the family. Maybe the idea is that the parent not working can manage the night shifts because their schedule is more flexible.\n\nBut is there a cultural or societal norm here? In some cultures, it's expected that the parent not working takes over nighttime duties, while others advocate for equal sharing. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting that. The original poster is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the parent on leave should handle the night feeds when one parent is working.\n\nI think the answer depends on the specific circumstances of the family. If the parent on leave is willing and able to take on more, then maybe it's reasonable. But if it's creating an unequal burden or resentment, that's a problem. The key here is mutual agreement and what the couple is comfortable with. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parent on leave is the one who volunteers or agrees to take the night shifts, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if they're imposing that expectation without considering the parent on leave's needs or preferences, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer isn't clear-cut. But the user is asking for a choice between A and B. Considering that the parent on leave might have more flexibility and that some people do expect the non-working parent to take over night duties, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the parent on leave is also dealing with their own challenges, expecting them to handle all the night feeds could be unfair. But the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's stance is based on practicality (the working parent is tired from work), then maybe the author is not in the wrong. The answer could be B (No).\n"
