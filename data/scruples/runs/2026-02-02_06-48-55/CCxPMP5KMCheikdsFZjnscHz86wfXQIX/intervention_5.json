      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle night feedings. The scenario involves splitting overnight duties when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices and societal expectations. Often, parental leave is intended to allow the parent to bond with the baby and share in the care. If one parent is working, they might have less time during the day, so taking turns at night could help balance responsibilities. However, each family's situation is unique. The parent on leave might be handling more daytime tasks, so taking over at night could help them get more rest. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the parent not working should handle the night feedings. This could be based on the idea that the working parent needs their rest to function during the day, while the stay-at-home parent can adjust their sleep schedule. However, this might not account for the fact that the stay-at-home parent might already be doing more during the day and needs rest too. Shared responsibility is often encouraged, so expecting the non-working parent to take all night duties could be seen as unfair if it's not mutually agreed upon.\n\nAlso, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context suggests the author is seeking validation for their stance. If the other parent feels burdened or if it's agreed upon that they should take turns, the author's position might be considered selfish. But if both parents have agreed that the on-leave parent should handle nights, then it's not the author's fault.\n\nIn many cases, the assumption that the stay-at-home parent handles more childcare is outdated and can lead to resentment. It's important for both parents to communicate and find a fair arrangement. The author might be in the wrong if they're not considering the other parent's needs or if the arrangement isn't mutual. However, without more context about the specific family's agreement, it's hard to say definitively. But generally, expecting the non-working parent to take on all night duties without considering their own well-being might be seen as unfair. So the answer is A.\n"
