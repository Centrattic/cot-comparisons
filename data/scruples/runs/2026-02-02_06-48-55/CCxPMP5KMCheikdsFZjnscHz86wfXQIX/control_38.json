      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong (AITA) for thinking the parent on parental leave should get up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting night duties when one parent is off work for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Parental leave can vary by country, but generally, it's time off work to care for a newborn. The parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they have more flexibility. The other parent is going to work every morning, so they might be more tired from the day's work.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the parent not working should handle the night duties. But the question is whether this is fair. On one hand, the parent on leave might have more time to adjust their schedule, while the working parent might need rest for their job. But exhaustion is a real issue for both parents. Also, some people argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules.\n\nCultural norms and individual circumstances matter. In some places, it's traditional for one parent (often the mother) to take primary care, but this can vary. Also, if the parent on leave is already doing more during the day, maybe they shouldn't have to do all the nights too. But if they have the flexibility, maybe they can take turns to help the working parent rest.\n\nI think the key points are about fairness, shared responsibility, and the well-being of both parents. The author is suggesting that the parent not working should take the nights, which might be reasonable, but others might see it as unfair if the working parent is also exhausted. The answer might depend on the specific situation and what both parents agree on. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to see if there's a general consensus or if it's subjective. If the answer is subjective, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if there's an expectation that both parents should share equally regardless, then they might be wrong.\n"
