      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should get up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to go to work each morning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more flexibility to handle nighttime feedings or baby duties. The working parent has to get up early for work, so maybe they need more rest. The author argues that the non-working parent should take over the overnight responsibilities to let the working parent sleep. \n\nIs this a common viewpoint? I know that some parents believe in sharing nighttime duties equally, but others think the parent who isn't working should handle it to support the one who's working. There's also the aspect of physical recovery for the new parent, especially if it's the mother postpartum. But the post doesn't specify which parent is on leave, so maybe it's either parent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for holding this opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider societal norms, common practices, and whether the author's reasoning is valid. \n\nSome might argue that both parents should share equally regardless of work schedules to maintain equality. Others might agree that the working parent needs rest for work. The author's reasoning is based on practicality\u2014since one parent is already not working, they can manage the overnights. This seems logical. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for this opinion. It's a matter of personal choice and what works for the family. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
