      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other is going to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Parental leave is typically taken to bond with the baby and help with the transition, which can be physically and emotionally demanding. The parent on leave might be adjusting to the new routine, and getting up multiple times at night can be exhausting. They might also be dealing with postpartum recovery, which could make sleep even more important.\n\nThe other parent is going to work, which is a significant responsibility. They might be tired from work and need their rest to function the next day. However, sharing nighttime duties can help both parents get some rest and support each other. It's possible that the parent on leave has the flexibility to adjust their schedule since they're not working, while the working parent needs to maintain a consistent sleep cycle.\n\nBut the author's stance is that the parent on leave should handle the overnight feedings or duties. They argue that splitting the overnights is unnecessary because one parent is already off work. The question is whether this is a reasonable expectation.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and common practices. In many cases, parents do split duties, but when one parent is on leave, it's not uncommon for that parent to take on more responsibilities during the day. However, nighttime duties can be different because they disrupt sleep. The parent on leave might need rest as much as the working parent, especially if they're dealing with postpartum issues.\n\nThere's also the aspect of fairness and mutual support. Even if one parent is on leave, sharing the load could prevent resentment and ensure both parents are involved. However, the parent on leave might have more flexibility to adjust their schedule without the pressure of a job.\n\nThe key points here are the well-being of both parents and the baby. The parent on leave might need to be the primary caregiver at night, but it's important that both parents are involved in some way. However, the author's argument is that splitting isn't necessary in this scenario, which could be seen as a reasonable perspective given the circumstances.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The answer depends on whether the author is wrong for not wanting to split the duties. If the parent on leave is capable and it's working for them, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if it's causing strain or the parent on leave is overburdened, then maybe they are wrong. However, the question is about the author's stance being in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that splitting isn't necessary when one parent is on leave, which could be a valid point. So, the answer might be B (No) because the author isn't wrong in thinking the parent on leave should handle it, given their flexibility.\n"
