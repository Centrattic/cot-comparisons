      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about sharing nighttime duties with a baby when one parent is on parental leave. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the nighttime feedings while the other parent, who has to go to work in the morning, gets some sleep.\n\nHmm, I need to think about the dynamics here. Parental leave usually means one parent isn't working, so they might have more flexibility in their schedule. The parent going to work might be more tired in the morning after a night of baby duties. But then again, the parent on leave might already be up with the baby during the day, so getting some rest at night is important too.\n\nThere's also the aspect of fairness and shared responsibility. Even if one parent is on leave, they might still be handling a lot during the day, so getting some sleep at night is necessary. On the other hand, the working parent might need to be well-rested for their job. But maybe the parent on leave can adjust their schedule since they don't have a job to go to. However, that doesn't mean they should take all the nighttime responsibilities. It's possible that the working parent could take some nights off to balance it out.\n\nI should consider cultural norms as well. In some cultures, the parent on leave is expected to take on more infant care duties, while others emphasize equal sharing regardless of work status. The question is whether the author's expectation is reasonable. If they're suggesting that the parent not working should handle all the nighttime duties, is that fair?\n\nBut maybe the key point is that both parents should share the load. Even if one is on leave, they might still be exhausted from daytime duties. Requiring them to take all the nights might not be fair. So the author's assumption that the parent on leave should do all the overnights might be where they're wrong. They should consider that both parents need rest and that sharing the nights, even if one is on leave, is more balanced.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not considering that the parent on leave also needs rest and that the working parent might also need to share the nighttime duties to maintain their own health and ability to work effectively. It's a shared responsibility, and expecting one parent to handle all of it isn't fair.\n"
