      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe original question is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is on parental leave. The author is saying they think the parent on leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night because the other parent is working every morning. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this belief. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of parental leave. Typically, the parent on leave isn't working, so they might have more flexibility. But does that mean they should take all the night shifts? Maybe not necessarily. Both parents might want to share the load to balance their relationship and mental health. Even if one parent isn't working, they might still have responsibilities during the day, like caring for the baby or managing household tasks. \n\nAlso, the parent who is working might be more tired from the day job and need rest. But the parent on leave might be home all the time and could handle the night wakings. However, it's important to consider that both parents need sleep for their well-being and ability to care for the baby. The assumption that the non-working parent should take all the night shifts might not be fair. Partnerships in parenting often require compromise and communication. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should automatically take all the night duties without considering the other parent's needs or discussing it together, that could be problematic. It's possible that the non-working parent also needs rest to function during the day or to handle other responsibilities. \n\nBut then again, if the parent on leave is not working, maybe they can take on more of the night duties. It's a tricky balance. The key here is whether the author is imposing their opinion without considering mutual agreement. Parenting is a team effort, so expecting one parent to take all the night shifts without discussion might be unfair. \n\nSo, if the author is insisting that the parent on leave must do all the night wakings without any consideration for their own needs or the other parent's situation, that could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the parent on leave volunteers or they've agreed to split it that way, then it's different. But the original question seems to be from someone who is advising someone else, suggesting that the parent on leave should do it. \n\nI think the user's answer is \"A\" (in the wrong) because the author is making a judgment without considering the complexities. The right approach would be discussing and finding a solution that works for both parents. So the author's stance might be seen as assuming the parent on leave should take all the night shifts, which isn't necessarily fair. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
