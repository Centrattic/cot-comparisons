      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nThe situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is on parental leave and the other is still working. The author argues that it doesn't make sense to split the overnights because the working parent has to get up for work every morning, while the other parent is off for six weeks. They're asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for this belief.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know what I think. The options are A for yes (author wrong) or B for no (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning here. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take overnights, which could make sense because they're not working. The working parent might need rest to function during the day. So splitting overnights might not be necessary if one parent isn't working. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Parenting responsibilities can vary, and what's fair can depend on the family's specific circumstances. Some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. However, others might see practical reasons to have the non-working parent take more nighttime duties to support the working parent's need for rest. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reasoning is justified. If the parent on leave is available to take overnights, it could be reasonable for them to do so. However, expecting that parent to take all overnights could be seen as unfair if they also need rest. But the author is suggesting that splitting isn't needed, not that the non-working parent should take all of them. \n\nParental leave is often intended to allow parents to bond with the child and share in the care. If the working parent is exhausted from the job, having the non-working parent take overnights could be a practical arrangement. But there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're suggesting that splitting isn't necessary because of the work schedule, that's a valid point. However, some might argue that the parent on leave should also get rest for their own well-being. But the author's question is whether they're the a**hole for thinking the non-working parent should take overnights. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a personal decision. The author isn't necessarily wrong for thinking that way, especially if it's based on practical reasons. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a reasonable argument based on the work schedules.\n"
