      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should stay up with the baby at night when the other parent is working. The question is from a forum like Reddit's AITA (Am I the Asshole?) where people ask if their actions are unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical dynamics of parental leave and shared responsibilities. Parental leave is usually intended to give the parent time to bond with the baby and manage the new responsibilities. However, when it comes to overnight feedings, both parents might have their own schedules and needs. \n\nThe author's argument is that since one parent is off work and the other isn't, the one on leave should handle the night duties. But is that fair? Well, it's a common debate. Some might say both parents should share the load to maintain a balanced relationship and so both can bond with the baby. Others might argue that the parent on leave is already sacrificing work to be there, so it's reasonable for them to take on more during that time. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider each parent's physical and emotional needs. Staying up all night can be exhausting, and expecting one parent to handle all of that, even if they're on leave, might not be sustainable or fair. The parent working might also need rest to function well at work the next day. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of shared parenting. If the working parent never gets up at night, they might miss out on bonding opportunities, which can affect the relationship with the child. Plus, if the parent on leave is the only one handling the night feeds, they might feel overwhelmed, leading to burnout or resentment. \n\nBut the situation can vary. If the parent on leave is okay with handling the night duties and it's by mutual agreement, that's different. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author's assumption that the parent on leave should be the one to handle the overnights without considering the other parent's perspective or the couple's agreement might be the issue. \n\nIn some cases, the parent not on leave might still have to go to work, so taking a night feed could disrupt their sleep. But if they can adjust their schedule to help, it's better for both parents. The author's stance might come off as not considering the working parent's need for rest. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the one to handle the night duties because they're not working. However, this might not account for the fact that both parents need rest and shared responsibilities. It could lead to resentment if it's not a mutual decision. Therefore, the author's perspective might be seen as not in the wrong, but it's a situational answer. But since the question is from the AITA perspective, the community might see the author as not considering the other parent's needs. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that the parent on leave is already making a sacrifice by not working, so they should be the primary caregiver. However, others might say that both parents should share the load to maintain a healthy relationship. The answer depends on the context, but generally, expecting one parent to handle all night duties without discussion could be seen as not in the wrong, but suggesting it as a universal rule might not be. \n\nIn AITA questions, the community often looks for fairness and consideration. The author's question implies that the parent on leave should take overnights, which might be seen as reasonable, but if it's not discussed or agreed upon, it could be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion. If the author is just expressing a viewpoint and not enforcing it without discussion, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're insisting on it without considering the other parent's perspective, maybe they are. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether it's a mutual agreement. The author's stance is a valid perspective, but it's not the only one. So in the AITA context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is asking for opinions, and their viewpoint is a common one. However, some might argue that they should consider both parents' needs. But since the question is from the author's perspective, the community might not see them as in the wrong for having that opinion.\n"
