      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other is working. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should take over the night duties because the working parent has to get up for work in the morning. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspectives on this. In many cases, parental leave is meant to allow the parent to bond with the baby and take on more responsibilities. However, sleep deprivation is a huge issue for new parents. If the working parent needs to get up early for work, they might not get enough rest, which could affect their job performance or health. On the other hand, the parent on leave might argue that they are already not working and should have the chance to rest when they can.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on the specific circumstances and the agreement between the parents. Some couples might split the duties regardless of work schedules, others might prioritize the working parent's need for sleep. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave can handle the night feeds since they don't have to get up early. That seems logical, but it's also possible that the parent on leave is also exhausted and needs their rest for the next day's caregiving. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's stance is fair. If both parents are sharing equally in the responsibilities despite the work schedule, then the author might be seen as selfish. However, if they're trying to optimize for the working parent's well-being, it's a practical approach. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since it's subjective and depends on the couple's values and circumstances, I'm not sure. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they're making a practical decision based on the working parent's needs. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
