      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up at night, since the other parent is going to work in the morning. So the main point is splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices. Usually, when one parent is on leave, they might take more responsibility because they're not working. But it's also possible that both parents want to share equally. However, the parent going to work in the morning might need sleep to function during the day, which could be important for their job. On the other hand, the parent on leave might have more flexibility. \n\nBut does that mean the parent on leave should always get up? Maybe not. Some couples prefer to alternate or find a balance based on their specific situation. The author's reasoning is that the parent on leave can afford to stay up because they don't have to work, so they should take over the night duties. However, some might argue that parenting responsibilities should be shared more equitably, regardless of employment status. \n\nAlso, the parent on leave might be doing a lot already during the day, so needing rest as well. The key here is whether the author's assumption is reasonable. If the parent on leave is willing and able to take over the night duties, then maybe it's okay. But if it's causing resentment or imbalance, then maybe not. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the parent on leave is the one who chooses to take over night feedings, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if they're making the other parent feel they must do it, maybe that's an issue. However, the post is more about the author's opinion rather than enforcing it. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is suggesting a reasonable arrangement where the parent not working can handle the night duties. It's a common strategy to let the working parent get more sleep. Unless there are other factors like health or agreement between the parents, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
