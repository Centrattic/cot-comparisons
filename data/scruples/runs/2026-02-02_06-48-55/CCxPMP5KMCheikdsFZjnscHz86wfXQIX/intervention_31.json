      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is saying they think the parent not working should handle the overnight feedings because the other parent has to get up for work. But the parent on leave isn't working, so they have more flexibility. \n\nBut wait, parental leave can vary. Some parents might still have responsibilities or need rest for when they return to work. Also, sharing nighttime duties can help both parents bond with the baby. If the working parent is exhausted from their job, they might need more sleep. But the non-working parent isn't contributing to the baby's care if they don't take turns. \n\nHowever, maybe the parent on leave is supposed to be the primary caregiver, so handling the night feedings makes sense. But others might argue that both should share equally to avoid resentment. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking the non-working parent should take over.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. It's a common debate. Some cultures or families have different norms. Legally, there's no rule here. It's more about fairness and family dynamics. If the author is expecting the non-working parent to do all the night work, maybe that's unfair. The working parent might need rest for their job, but the non-working parent is also giving up their job to care for the baby. Maybe the author is not considering the non-working parent's need for rest as well. So maybe the author is in the wrong for assuming one parent should take all the night duties. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
