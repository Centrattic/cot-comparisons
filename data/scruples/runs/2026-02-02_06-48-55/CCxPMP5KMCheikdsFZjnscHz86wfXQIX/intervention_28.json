      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. The author is asking if they're wrong for thinking that the parent not working should take overnights, while the other parent is going to work the next day. The person thinks the author is in the wrong and wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general expectations around parental leave and shared responsibilities. Parental leave is typically intended to allow a parent to bond with the newborn and help with childcare. The parent on leave isn't working, so maybe they have more flexibility to take on night duties. However, this can vary based on the couple's agreement, physical ability, and personal preferences.\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable to think that the parent who isn't working can take the overnights so the working parent can get enough rest for work. That makes sense because the working parent needs to be alert. On the other hand, some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. But parental leave is supposed to provide respite from work, so maybe the non-working parent is in a better position to handle night feedings.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of fairness and the fact that taking leave is a sacrifice in itself. If they split the overnights equally, the parent on leave might not get enough sleep either, which could be tiring. The key here is that the situation can depend on the specific circumstances of the couple. If they haven't discussed or agreed on this, the author's perspective might be seen as reasonable. However, if the parent on leave is expected to handle all the overnights without question, that could be a point of contention.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the parent on leave should take overnights. If the author is making a general assumption without considering the other parent's needs or the couple's specific agreement, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if they are advocating for a logical division based on work schedules, then they might be right. The answer hinges on whether the author is being considerate and flexible.\n\nIn many cases, couples do alternate or adjust based on work, so the author's suggestion isn't unreasonable. However, if the parent on leave is already sacrificing their job, expecting them to take all overnights could be seen as unfair. But the parent on leave might have more availability, so it's a balancing act. The community in AITA threads often looks at whether the person is being inconsiderate or rigid. If the author is just stating their opinion without being judgmental, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're dismissing the other parent's valid needs, they could be.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author's stance is reasonable, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
