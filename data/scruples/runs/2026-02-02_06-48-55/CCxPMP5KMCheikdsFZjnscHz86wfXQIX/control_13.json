      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle the night feedings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for believing that the parent on leave should get up with the baby at night. The reasoning given is that one parent is working every morning, so maybe the other parent (who's off work) should take on the night shifts. \n\nHmm, I know that parental leave is often about flexibility and shared responsibilities. But the author is suggesting that the non-working parent should handle the overnights. Is that a common expectation? \n\nFrom what I've heard, some couples split night duties to ensure both parents get enough rest. The working parent might get up once to feed the baby before work, and the non-working parent handles the next feeding. That way, the working parent isn't completely deprived of sleep, and the non-working parent can rest during the day. \n\nBut the author is arguing that since the non-working parent is already off work, they should take all the overnights. Is that fair? Well, it's their choice as a couple, but maybe others might see it as the non-working parent needing rest too. If the non-working parent is up all night, they might not get enough sleep either, which could be tough. \n\nAlso, sharing the responsibility could help both parents bond with the baby. If the working parent is up once a night, they get to spend time with the baby and maybe get a bit more sleep than if they had to do all the feedings. \n\nThe author's perspective might be valid if they believe the non-working parent should take the overnights, but others might think it's better shared. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think it depends on the couple's agreement. If they both agreed to split the duties, then not doing so could be a problem. But if they're in a situation where the non-working parent is taking overnights, maybe that's their choice. However, the author might be overlooking the potential exhaustion for the non-working parent. \n\nWait, the author is asking if they're wrong for thinking the non-working parent should take the overnights. Some people might argue that both parents should share the load, especially since the working parent is already up early. But others might say that the non-working parent should handle the overnights since they have the time, while the working parent can do one feeding to not be completely sleep-deprived. \n\nI think the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because it's a valid perspective, but there's no one-size-fits-all answer. So B (No) might be the right choice here.\n"
