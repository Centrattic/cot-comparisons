      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night. The author is suggesting that the parent on parental leave should handle the overnight feedings, since the other parent has to get up for work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave can vary by country, but generally, the parent not working is supposed to have time to care for the child. However, the author is arguing that the non-working parent should take over nighttime duties. Is this fair?\n\nI know that sleep deprivation is a big issue for new parents. If the working parent has to wake up early for work regardless, maybe they're already getting less sleep. The non-working parent might have more flexibility to adjust their sleep schedule to care for the baby during the night. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's fair to expect the non-working parent to handle all the overnights. \n\nThere's also the aspect of shared responsibility. Even if one parent is on leave, both might want to share the duties. But if one parent is working, their schedule is more rigid. The author's reasoning is that the non-working parent has more time, so they should take the night shifts. That could make sense in terms of practicality. But is it right to assign all the night duties to one parent? \n\nAnother angle is that parental leave is meant to allow both parents to bond with the child. If the working parent is busy with work during the day, maybe they should still take some night duties to share the load. But if they have to wake up for work, maybe they can't get enough sleep, so the non-working parent should handle it. \n\nI think the author's point is logical from a practical standpoint. If one parent is working, their schedule is more demanding, so the other parent taking over the night shifts could be seen as reasonable. However, some might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities regardless of work schedules. But given that the working parent's sleep is already compromised by their work hours, it's fair for the non-working parent to take the overnights. So the author might not be in the wrong here. \n\nBut wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Maybe they feel that splitting the duties is better. But if splitting isn't possible, then the author's suggestion makes sense. It's about practicality rather than fairness. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
