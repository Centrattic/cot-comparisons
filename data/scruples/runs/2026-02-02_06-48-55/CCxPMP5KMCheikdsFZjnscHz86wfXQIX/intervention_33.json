      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on parental leave and the other has to go to work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the overnight feedings. The other parent isn't working and has more flexibility. The question is whether the author is right to think that way.\n\nI should consider common practices and societal norms. Some people believe that the parent not working should take on more nighttime duties so the working parent can get enough rest for their job. That makes sense because the working parent needs to be alert during the day. On the other hand, some might argue that both parents should share responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. \n\nBut the key here is the practicality. If the parent on leave isn't working, they can afford to get less sleep and still have time to rest during the day. The working parent needs to be well-rested for their job. So, it's reasonable to think that the non-working parent should take over the nighttime duties. \n\nHowever, every family is different. Maybe there are other factors, like the parents' physical or mental health, or other responsibilities. But based solely on the information given, the author's reasoning seems logical. They're trying to balance the need for the working parent to rest and the flexibility of the parent on leave. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the argument is about fairness, some might say it's not fair to expect one parent to do all the night feedings. But if it's about practicality and ensuring the working parent can function at work, then the author's stance makes sense. \n\nIn many cases, people do split responsibilities based on work schedules. The parent on leave can take more of the nighttime duties, and the working parent can handle other tasks during the day. It's about adapting to the situation to make both parents' lives manageable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their reasoning is based on practical considerations rather than an unfair assumption. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
