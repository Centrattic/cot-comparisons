      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one to get up with the baby at night. The question is presented in the context of an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent on leave is not working, while the other parent is going to work every day. The author's argument is that since one parent has the flexibility of not working, they should take the overnight shifts. \n\nI should consider common practices and societal norms around parental leave. In many cultures, it's common for the parent not working to take on more childcare duties during the day, but what about at night? Some people might argue that all parents need to sleep to function, especially if one has to go to work early. On the other hand, the parent on leave might be expected to be more available for the baby's needs.\n\nBut then, it's also important to consider that the parent on leave might be adjusting to the new role and the lack of sleep can be challenging. Plus, the parent who is working might be physically or emotionally tired from the job, making it hard for them to get up multiple times at night. However, the other parent isn't working, so perhaps they have more flexibility.\n\nThere's also the aspect of fairness and shared responsibility. Even though one parent is on leave, it's possible that both should share the nighttime duties to avoid burnout and to ensure the working parent can get enough rest for their job. But if the parent on leave is already handling most of the daytime responsibilities, maybe they need their rest too.\n\nI should also think about any cultural or family-specific factors. In some families, the parent on leave is expected to take more responsibility, while in others, it's a shared effort regardless of work status. The question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable.\n\nThe key point is whether splitting the overnight duties is necessary. If the parent on leave is already awake during the day, maybe the working parent should take turns at night to balance it out. But the author's argument is that the parent on leave has no work obligations, so they can handle the nights. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for fairness and understanding. If the author is insisting that the non-working parent should take all the nights without considering their own needs, that could be seen as unfair. However, if it's a mutual agreement based on practicality, then it's different.\n\nSo, the answer depends on context. If the author is assuming it's inherently the non-working parent's responsibility without considering mutual agreement or the non-working parent's needs, they might be in the wrong. But if it's a mutual decision based on practical reasons (like the working parent needs to be rested for work), then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that way. The AITA community might side against the author if they're not being considerate of the non-working parent's needs. However, the author's logic is based on practicality. It's possible that the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), as it's a matter of perspective and practical arrangement rather than being objectively wrong.\n"
