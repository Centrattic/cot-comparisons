      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other is going to work every morning. The author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for thinking that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general expectations around parental leave and night shifts. In many cultures, it's common for both parents to share the responsibilities, but when one parent is on leave, maybe there's an assumption that they can take more of the nighttime duties since they're not working. The working parent might be more tired from their job, so it makes sense that the non-working parent handles the middle-of-the-night feeds or care.\n\nHowever, this isn't a one-size-fits-all situation. Some parents might prefer to share the load even if one is on leave. It could also depend on their specific circumstances, like the baby's age, the parents' work schedules, their physical and mental health, and any prior agreements or cultural norms they follow. For example, if the non-working parent is already handling a lot during the day, maybe the working parent should take some night shifts to balance it out.\n\nI should also think about fairness and mutual agreement. If both parents are in agreement about this arrangement, then it's probably not an issue. But if there's conflict or resentment, that's a different story. The key here is communication. Are they discussing their needs and preferences? Are there any unspoken expectations or assumptions?\n\nAnother angle is the idea that the parent on leave might have more flexibility to adjust their sleep schedule, whereas the working parent needs to be up early and might not get enough rest if they also have to get up at night. This could be a valid reason for the arrangement the author is suggesting. On the flip side, the parent on leave might still need rest to manage the daytime responsibilities effectively, so getting up at night could be draining for them too.\n\nI should also consider any potential biases. For instance, if there's a gender assumption here\u2014like expecting the mother to take more night duties\u2014that could be problematic. But the question doesn't specify gender, so maybe that's not the case here. The main point is about parental leave and work schedules.\n\nIn some cases, the parent on leave might be the primary caregiver during the day, so taking night duties as well might help maintain bonding. However, if the working parent is also trying to manage their job, they might not have the energy. It's a balance between what's practical and what's fair.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Is the author in the wrong? If they're suggesting that the parent on leave should naturally take the night shifts without discussing it with their partner, maybe they're making an assumption. But if they're considering the practicalities (like the working parent needing to wake up early and be rested), then their reasoning might be valid. The answer depends on whether there's agreement between both parents. If there's no agreement and they're imposing this without discussion, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if it's a mutual decision based on practical reasons, then not. Since the question is about the author's stance, if they're just expressing an opinion based on practicality and not being dismissive of their partner's needs, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're not considering their partner's perspective, then they could be. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this belief. The answer might be B (No) if their reasoning is based on practical considerations and mutual agreement.\n"
