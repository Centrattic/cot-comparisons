      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night when one parent is on leave and the other is working.\n\nSo the author is saying they think the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. Their reasoning is that the other parent has to get up for work every morning, while the parent on leave doesn't have that same time constraint. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking this way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around parental leave. Parental leave is meant to give parents time to bond with their child and manage early childcare responsibilities. The parent on leave isn't working, so their schedule is more flexible. However, getting up multiple times at night can be exhausting. The working parent has an early start, which adds stress and fatigue. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the non-working parent should handle the night feedings. But is that a fair assumption? Well, parents often have to share responsibilities, and it's not always a given that the non-working parent should take over all night duties. Both parents might want to share the load to prevent burnout. Also, some parents might prefer alternating nights so they can both get some rest. \n\nOn the other hand, the working parent might need as much sleep as possible to function during the day. Letting the non-working parent take the night shifts could help the working parent get more rest. But the non-working parent might also need sleep to cope with the challenges of parental leave. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here because every family's situation is different. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is wrong for their stance. The question is whether their reasoning is valid. I don't think the author is in the wrong for suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the night feedings. It's a common arrangement in many families, especially when one parent has to work early. However, it's also important to consider the non-working parent's well-being. If they're already doing most of the daytime care, taking all the night shifts could lead to exhaustion. \n\nBut in the scenario presented, the author is just expressing their opinion without making a demand. They're asking if they're the asshole for thinking this way. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family agreements. Some might argue that both parents should share equally, but practical considerations like work schedules can influence how responsibilities are divided. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They're looking for validation that their perspective is reasonable. The answer would be B (No) because their reasoning is based on practical work commitments and it's a common arrangement.\n"
