      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to go to work in the morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on parental leave and sleep responsibilities. Typically, parents on leave might have more flexibility and time to care for the baby, especially during the early months when sleep patterns are irregular. The parent returning to work might need to get up early, so getting less sleep at night could disrupt their schedule more. However, the parent on leave might also be adjusting to being home with the baby and might need rest for their own well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of shared responsibility. Even though one parent is on leave, both parents might want to share the nighttime duties for bonding with the baby. But if one parent is off work, they might not have the same time constraints as the other. The parent working might need to be up early and thus need more sleep. The parent on leave could potentially handle it since they don't have a job to go to in the morning, which could be practical.\n\nBut then again, expecting the parent on leave to take all the overnights might not be fair either, as they also need rest. It's a balance between practicality and fairness. Some people might argue that it's reasonable for the parent on leave to take overnights since they have more time, while others might say both should share the duty regardless.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the leave-taking parent should handle the overnights. If the reasoning is based on the practical aspect that the working parent needs more sleep, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if it's dismissive of the parent on leave's need for rest, then maybe they are in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer would depend on the specific circumstances, but generally, it's a common practice for the parent not working to handle more nighttime duties to help the working parent maintain their schedule. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
