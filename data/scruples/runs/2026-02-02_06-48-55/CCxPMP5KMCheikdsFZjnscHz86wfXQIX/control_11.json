      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author is suggesting that it's unfair to split the overnight duties when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical dynamics of parental leave. Usually, the parent not working is expected to take on more childcare responsibilities, including night feedings. This allows the working parent to rest and be functional for their job the next day. But there might be exceptions depending on the family's specific situation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the parent on leave is off work for six weeks, so they should handle the overnight care. That makes sense because they have the flexibility to do so without the pressure of a job. However, some might argue that both parents should share the load equally, regardless of work schedules. But that approach doesn't take into account the practicalities of one parent needing to be alert for work.\n\nI should also think about cultural or societal norms. In many places, it's common for the non-working parent to take primary responsibility for night feedings. But this isn't a universal rule, and some families choose to share those duties. The key here is whether the author's expectation is reasonable given the context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this. If the answer hinges on the idea that the parent on leave should be the one to get up, then the author isn't wrong. However, if the family has agreed to split duties for some reason, then maybe the author is being inflexible. But the question doesn't mention any prior agreement, just the author's personal thought.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their reasoning is practical and aligns with common expectations during parental leave. The parent on leave isn't required to take all the overnight shifts, but it's a reasonable and often recommended approach to support the working parent's job performance.\n"
