      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting overnight duties with a baby when one parent is on parental leave. The author thinks the parent on leave should be the one getting up at night, while the other parent is working and needs to get up early for work.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. I need to figure out the answer based on common practices and fairness.\n\nFirst, parental leave is supposed to allow the parent to bond with the baby and share the care responsibilities. If one parent is on leave, they have more flexibility, while the working parent has a fixed schedule. It's reasonable to expect the parent on leave to take on some of the overnight duties, especially since they don't have to leave for work early. This could help the working parent get more rest during the night when possible.\n\nHowever, every family's situation is different. Factors like the parents' physical condition, the baby's schedule, and their preferences matter. But in general, the parent not working might have more availability to handle those middle-of-the-night feeds or checks. The key here is that the working parent needs to be rested for their job, so the other parent taking over at night makes sense.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is based on the assumption that the parent on leave can adjust their schedule more since they don't have a job to rush to. That seems fair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B, No.\n"
