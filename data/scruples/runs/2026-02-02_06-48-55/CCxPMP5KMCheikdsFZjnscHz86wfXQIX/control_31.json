      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working. The question is whether splitting the overnights is fair when one parent is working every morning and the other isn't working for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general expectations around parental leave and responsibilities. Parental leave is typically intended to allow a parent to bond with the child and take care of their needs. If one parent is on leave, they might have more flexibility to care for the baby at night, whereas the working parent needs to get up early for work. That could make sense because the working parent might be more tired from the commute and work stress, so getting more sleep could be beneficial. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, regardless of work schedules. But then again, if the other parent is not working, they might have more time to adjust their schedule for night feedings. Also, the parent on leave might be more available to care for the baby during the night since they don't have the added stress of an early morning job. \n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some cultures, it's common for the parent not working to take on more nighttime responsibilities. However, in other cases, parents might prefer to split duties to ensure both are involved. But the key point here is that the working parent has an early morning commitment, which might make it harder for them to get up multiple times during the night. So, maybe it's more practical for the parent on leave to handle the middle-of-the-night feedings so the working parent can get more sleep and be rested for work.\n\nAnother angle is the well-being of the working parent. If they have to get up early for work, and also have to get up multiple times during the night, they might not get enough rest. That could affect their job performance and overall health. The parent on leave, not having the work demands, can adjust their sleep schedule to accommodate the baby's needs more easily.\n\nBut does that mean the author is in the wrong? If they believe that the parent on leave should take over, then maybe they are right in terms of practicality and supporting the working parent's job. However, if the other parent is also expecting to share the responsibility, even though they're on leave, then the author's stance might be seen as unfair. \n\nI think the key here is the practical aspect. The working parent needs rest for their job, and the parent on leave has the flexibility to manage night feedings. So, the author's reasoning seems logical. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
