      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The author argues that it's unfair to split the overnight duties when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nHmm, parental leave can vary depending on the country and the company's policies. In some places, parents can take unpaid leave or have specific benefits. Let's consider the general case. The parent not working might have more flexibility to handle nighttime duties without the pressure of an early work schedule. On the other hand, maybe the working parent would appreciate help to be well-rested for work. \n\nBut wait, should the non-working parent automatically take over all the nighttime duties? That could lead to burnout. Sharing responsibilities is usually healthier for both parents and the child. Maybe the author's stance is a bit rigid. They might be assuming that the non-working parent can manage all the night shifts, but that's not necessarily fair. Both parents need rest, even if one is on leave. \n\nAlso, some people might argue that the working parent should still contribute to nighttime duties so they don't feel disconnected from the baby. The author is suggesting that the non-working parent should take over, which could be seen as practical but possibly unfair in the long run. \n\nI think the key here is fairness and mutual agreement. The author might not be wrong in their reasoning, but insisting on this without considering the non-working parent's needs could be problematic. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Let me double-check. \n\nIf the parent on leave is supposed to be the primary caregiver, maybe the author's position is reasonable. However, expecting that parent to handle all night duties without compromise might not be fair. It's a balance. But the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking that way. \n\nI think the answer is B because the author's reasoning is practical, considering the working parent's need to be rested. However, the situation isn't black and white. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean toward B. The author isn't necessarily wrong for thinking that way, but it's a nuanced situation. So, B.\n"
