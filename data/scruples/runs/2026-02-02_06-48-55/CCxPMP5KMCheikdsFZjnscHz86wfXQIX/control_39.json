      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking the parent on parental leave should handle the overnight feedings. The question is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The author doesn't understand splitting overnights when one parent is working and the other is on leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspectives on this. Parental leave is a time when the parent is not working, so they might have more flexibility. However, sleep deprivation is a big issue for new parents. Some people might argue that the working parent needs to rest to be effective at their job, so the non-working parent should take the night shifts. Others might say that both parents should share the responsibilities equally, even if one is on leave. \n\nThe key points here are the balance between work responsibilities and family duties. The working parent needs to be alert for work, so getting sufficient sleep is crucial for their job performance. On the other hand, the parent on leave might be better positioned to handle nighttime duties since they're not tied down by a morning routine. \n\nI should also think about cultural norms and what's considered fair. In some cultures, the parent not working is expected to take on more nighttime duties. However, in other cases, parents might still want to share equally regardless of work status. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong in their opinion. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the overnights because they're not working, that's a practical approach. It allows the working parent to rest and maintain their work performance. So, the author's reasoning seems logical. \n\nBut maybe some people would argue that both parents should contribute equally regardless of work commitments, which could lead to the author being seen as not considering the non-working parent's need for rest as well. However, the non-working parent is on leave, so they might have the capacity to handle it. \n\nIn the AITA context, being in the \"wrong\" usually means the opinion is seen as unreasonable or inconsiderate. If the author is suggesting that the working parent shouldn't have to get up at night because they're busy during the day, that's a reasonable argument. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author's reasoning is based on practicality and the working parent's need to rest for their job, which is a valid perspective.\n"
