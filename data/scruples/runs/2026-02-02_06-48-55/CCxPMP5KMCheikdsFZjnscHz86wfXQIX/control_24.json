      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is about splitting overnight duties when one parent is off work for six weeks and the other has to go to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on parental leave and responsibilities. Typically, parental leave is intended to allow a parent to bond with the baby and manage some of the childcare duties. However, the other parent is still working and might be more tired from their job. \n\nThe question is whether it's fair for the working parent to be responsible during the day and the non-working parent at night. Some people might argue that the parent on leave should handle night duties since they're not working, allowing the working parent to rest. Others might say that both parents should share the load equally, even if one isn't working, to maintain balance and prevent resentment.\n\nAlso, the user mentions splitting overnights when one parent is working. Maybe the working parent needs to wake up early for work, so having them deal with a crying baby at night might be more tiring. On the other hand, the parent on leave might need rest to handle daytime responsibilities, so getting up at night could help them stay rested during the day.\n\nI should think about the purpose of parental leave. It's supposed to help with adjusting to the new baby, so if the parent on leave is handling night feedings, they can bond more. But if they're exhausted, that could backfire. Alternatively, splitting duties could be a way to share the workload, but maybe the user's logic is that the parent not working can take the night shifts since they don't have to be productive in the morning.\n\nI need to check if there's a standard practice. In some cultures or families, it's common for the non-working parent to take care of night feedings. However, it's also about what the parents agree on. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for this belief. If the other parent disagrees, then it could cause conflict. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in their thinking, not the actual actions.\n\nSo, considering all angles, there's no universal right or wrong here. It's situational and depends on the parents' agreement. However, the author's reasoning might not be in the wrong if they're considering the working parent's need for rest. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
