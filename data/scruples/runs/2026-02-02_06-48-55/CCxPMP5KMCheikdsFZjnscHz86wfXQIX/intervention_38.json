      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The original question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working. The author splits up the overnights, thinking the parent on leave should take those.\n\nHmm, parental leave is a time when the parent isn't working, so they have more flexibility. But does that mean they should take all the night duties? Maybe not. Both parents should share responsibilities, right? But if one parent is already busy with work and has less time during the day, maybe it's fair for the other to take the night shifts. But I'm not sure. Some might argue that the working parent is already stressed with work, so they need rest. But the parent on leave might have more time to get up. However, it's a personal decision and varies by family. The author is assuming the parent on leave should take it, but others might think it's a shared responsibility. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not, because it's a matter of opinion. But some might say it's unfair to the parent on leave who might also need rest. But since they have the time, maybe it's reasonable. I'm a bit torn. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's a valid perspective, even if not everyone agrees.\n"
