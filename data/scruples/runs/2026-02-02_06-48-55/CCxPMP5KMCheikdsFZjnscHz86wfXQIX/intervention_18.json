      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially since one parent is at work every morning and the other isn't working for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Parental leave is typically taken to care for a newborn or newly adopted child, allowing the parent to bond and manage early childcare. The author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle nighttime feedings or wake-ups, as they're not working in the mornings. The other parent is working, so they need to get up early, and the author thinks the non-working parent should take over nighttime duties. \n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the parent on leave might be expected to take the lead in night duties since they're not working. That allows the working parent to get more rest during the day. But on the other hand, parents often alternate duties to share the workload, especially since sleep deprivation can be tough. The working parent might be exhausted from the day's job and need the night sleep to function the next day.\n\nI should also think about general parental advice. Many sources recommend that both parents help with night feedings to build a bond with the baby and to prevent the on-leave parent from being overwhelmed. Plus, the working parent might have a short leave period and wants to make the most of the time with the baby. However, if the leave is only six weeks, maybe they're expected to do more during that time.\n\nBut the author is questioning the assumption that the parent on leave should take all the overnights. Is that a valid assumption? Some might argue that it's fair because the working parent is up early anyway. Others might say it's not fair to expect the on-leave parent to handle all the overnights when they're already dealing with the majority of the daytime responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's important to recognize that each family's situation is different. If the working parent is up early, maybe they can take the first feed and then the on-leave parent handles the rest of the night. But the author's stance is that the on-leave parent should be the one getting up each time. Is that a common belief? Some people might see it as the on-leave parent's responsibility to do more, while others could argue that both should share to avoid resentment and ensure both parents are rested.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because it's a reasonable perspective that the parent not working can manage the overnights, allowing the working parent to rest during the day. However, it's also a topic where there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The key point is that the author is questioning the norm, and whether their view is valid. The answer might depend on the family's agreement and what works best for them. Since the question is about whether the author is the asshole, if the majority of people think it's fair for the on-leave parent to take overnights, then AITA would say A (the author is in the wrong). But if there's a valid argument for shared duties, then B (not in the wrong) could be the case.\n\nI should check common parenting advice. For example, many experts suggest that both parents take turns with night feedings to promote equal involvement and to prevent the on-leave parent from being solely responsible. However, practicality might dictate that the parent who isn't working can afford to get less sleep. It's a bit of a gray area. The author is not necessarily wrong, but it's a matter of differing opinions. However, the question is phrased as \"AITA for thinking...\" which implies that the author is defending their stance. If the community generally thinks it's unfair to not share the load, then the author is in the wrong. But if some see it as a valid approach given the work schedule, then they aren't. So I need to decide based on common beliefs.\n"
