      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) for thinking that the parent on leave should handle the overnight duties while the other parent is going to work every morning.\n\nFirst, I should consider common practices around parental leave and shared responsibilities. Typically, when a parent is on leave, they might take on more of the nighttime duties since they're not working. The other parent, who is working, has to get up early, so maybe it's logical for the non-working parent to get up with the baby. But I also know that some couples split the duties to share the load. \n\nThe author is arguing that it's not fair to split the overnights when one parent is off work. I should think about the reasons. The parent on leave might be able to adjust their schedule more easily since they don't have a job to wake up for. The working parent might be more tired from the workday and need more sleep. Also, the parent on leave might want to bond with the baby during the night. \n\nHowever, some people might argue that sharing the responsibilities is healthier for both parents and the baby, preventing resentment or burnout. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion. \n\nLooking at the community's usual responses to AITA questions, they often emphasize mutual agreement and the specific circumstances. If both parents haven't agreed on a plan, then the author's stance might be seen as reasonable. But if the other parent is also trying to share the load, maybe the author is being unfair. However, the scenario here is presented as the author's personal belief, not an action they're taking against another's wishes. \n\nIn AITA questions, the person is usually in the right if their actions are based on a reasonable perspective, especially when it comes to parental responsibilities. So the author's belief might be valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
