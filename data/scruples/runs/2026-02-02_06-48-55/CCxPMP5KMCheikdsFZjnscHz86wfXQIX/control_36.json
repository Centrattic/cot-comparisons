      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially when one parent has to go to work every morning and the other is off work for six weeks.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general expectations around parental leave and shared responsibilities. Parental leave policies can vary by country, but typically, the idea is to allow parents time to bond with their newborn and manage early childcare duties. However, when one parent is on leave, they might expect to take on more of the nighttime duties since they aren't working. \n\nThe author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle the nighttime feedings or wake-ups, so the working parent can get more rest for their job. On the surface, this seems logical because the working parent needs to be rested for their job. But I should also think about the physical and emotional toll of being on parental leave. Taking care of a newborn 24/7 can be exhausting, and splitting the night duties might help both parents get more sleep overall.\n\nHowever, there's the assumption that the parent on leave is the primary caregiver, but that's not necessarily always the case. Shared parental responsibilities can vary based on the family's dynamics. Maybe the working parent wants to be involved in nighttime care as well, or perhaps there's an agreement that the parent on leave should handle more during the day and the other parent takes over at night. \n\nAnother angle is that the parent on leave might be adjusting to their new role and might need rest too. If the author is suggesting that the leave parent should take all the nights, it could lead to them not getting enough sleep, which isn't healthy. So, maybe a balanced approach where they split the nights if possible would be better, even if one parent is working. \n\nBut the author's question is specifically about whether they are in the wrong for thinking the leave parent should handle the nights. If the parent on leave is capable and willing, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the leave parent is already overwhelmed, expecting them to do all the nights could be unfair. \n\nAlso, cultural norms and family agreements matter. If the family has agreed to share responsibilities differently, the author's opinion might clash with that. Without more context, it's hard to say. But generally, expecting the working parent to rest while the leave parent handles nights could be seen as reasonable, as the working parent needs to be functional during the day. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong. They're making a practical argument based on the working parent's need for rest. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
