      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is that one parent is on leave for six weeks, so they're not working, while the other parent has to be up early for work. The author doesn't understand splitting the overnight responsibilities in this case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's reasoning is that the parent not working can handle the night feedings, allowing the working parent to get enough rest for their job. That seems practical. But some might argue that both parents should share the duties regardless of work schedules. However, others might counter that the parent on leave is already adjusting to the new role and might need rest too, or that fairness in sharing duties is important even if one is not working.\n\nBut in reality, practical considerations often influence such decisions. If one parent needs to be well-rested for work, it's logical for the other parent to take on more of the night duties. However, the parent on leave might also have other responsibilities, like daytime care, and might be dealing with their own exhaustion from lack of sleep. So it's a balance.\n\nParenting decisions can vary based on family dynamics, health, and personal circumstances. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this opinion. Since there's no universally right answer, the author's perspective is valid. They're not wrong for thinking that splitting overnights unequally in this scenario makes sense. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
