      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about parental leave and who should get up with the baby at night. The author is saying they think the parent on leave should handle the night feedings since the other parent has to get up for work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parental leave can vary by country and workplace policies. In some places, parental leave is unpaid or limited, so the parent on leave might not have the option to prioritize sleep. Also, sharing night duties can be important for both parents' well-being and bonding with the baby.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the parent not at work doesn't need to wake up early, so they should take the night shifts. But others might argue that both parents should share the load, especially if the one on leave has other responsibilities or needs rest to manage daytime care. It's possible that the parent on leave is also dealing with a new baby's schedule, which can be irregular and exhausting.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here. Some people might agree with the author, thinking it's practical. Others might say it's unfair to the parent on leave, who might need rest as much as the working parent. Cultural norms and personal circumstances play a role here. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the author isn't necessarily wrong. They have a valid point based on their reasoning. However, it's also important to consider the other parent's perspective and the overall balance in the relationship.\n"
