      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially when the other parent is working and needs to get up early for work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Parental leave is typically a time when one parent takes time off work to care for the child. In many cases, especially in the early months, it's common for both parents to share responsibilities, but when one is on leave and the other is working, the balance might shift. The question is whether it's fair for the non-working parent to handle all the nighttime duties so the working parent can get rest for their job.\n\nThe original poster (AITA) is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the parent on leave should be the one up at night. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nI should consider cultural norms and typical practices. In some cultures, it's traditional for the parent not working to take on more of the nighttime duties so the working parent can stay rested for their job. However, this can vary, and some people might argue that both parents should share the responsibility regardless of work schedules. \n\nBut the working parent has to wake up early for work anyway, so they might not get much extra sleep even if they do get up. Meanwhile, the parent on leave might have more flexibility in their schedule. It's possible that the working parent could take a longer rest during the day. However, splitting the nights might still be beneficial for the working parent's energy levels, especially if they have a demanding job. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent on leave might already be managing most of the daytime care and could be exhausted from both the daytime duties and the nights. It's a balance between fairness and practicality. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. They argue that since one parent is working, the other should take the nights. There's no inherent right or wrong, but societal norms often support this idea. However, some might argue that both parents should share nighttime duties to maintain equality. \n\nI think the answer depends on the specific circumstances. If splitting the nights is feasible and doesn't interfere with the working parent's job, maybe it's better to share. But if the working parent needs to be up early regardless, maybe the parent on leave can handle the nights. The AITA format often leans towards considering traditional roles, but it's not always the case. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their reasoning is based on practicality, so the answer is B (no, they're not in the wrong).\n"
