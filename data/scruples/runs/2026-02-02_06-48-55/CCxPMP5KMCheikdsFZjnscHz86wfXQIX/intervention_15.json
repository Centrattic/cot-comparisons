      "text": "Okay, let's think through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for believing that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. The situation is that one parent is off work for six weeks, while the other has to go to work in the mornings. The author is asking if they're \"the asshole\" (AITA) for this belief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices and societal norms around parental leave and nighttime responsibilities. In many cases, when one parent is on leave, it's common for them to take on more of the nighttime duties. The reasoning might be that the parent at home is already not working, so they have more flexibility and can adjust their schedule to care for the baby. This allows the working parent to get more rest during the day when they can sleep, which is important for their ability to function at work.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. If the parent on leave works from home or has other responsibilities, they might need rest too. Also, some parents might prefer to split duties to share the load, even if one is working. But the question is about the author's belief being in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's assumption is reasonable. If the parent on leave is available and the other parent needs to be rested for work, it's a practical arrangement. But if the parent on leave also needs rest, especially if they're nursing or have health reasons, then it's not fair. The answer would depend on the specific circumstances, but the question doesn't provide those details. \n\nSince the author is generalizing a situation where the parent not working is available, it's likely that their reasoning is based on common sense. But parental leave policies and family dynamics vary. However, in many cases, the parent at home is expected to handle more of the nighttime duties. So the author might not be in the wrong here. But I need to check if there's an assumption that the parent on leave is always willing and able to take over. If there's no consideration of their needs, maybe the author is being dismissive. But without more info, it's hard to say. The question is whether the belief is wrong in general. \n\nIn most cases, expecting the non-working parent to handle night feedings is a common practice. Therefore, the author's belief isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
