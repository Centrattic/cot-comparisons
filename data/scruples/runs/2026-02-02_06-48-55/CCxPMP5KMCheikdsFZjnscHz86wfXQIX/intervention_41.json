      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author thinks that the parent on leave shouldn't have to get up multiple times at night because the other parent is working and needs sleep. They're asking if they're in the wrong for this opinion.\n\nHmm. Parenting responsibilities can be tough. When one parent is on leave, they might have more flexibility to handle nighttime duties, but it's not a strict rule. It really depends on the parents' circumstances and what works best for their family. Some might argue that both parents should share the workload equally, even if one is on leave. Others might think that the working parent needs rest, so the non-working parent takes on more responsibility. \n\nBut is there a right or wrong here? Parenting is often about what the family agrees on. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should be the only one handling nighttime duties, maybe they're not considering that both parents might want to share the responsibility, or that the parent on leave might also need rest for other reasons. However, if the working parent can't afford to be sleep-deprived because they need to be at work early, it's logical to have the non-working parent take over more.\n\nSo, the author's perspective isn't necessarily wrong. It's a matter of different viewpoints. The question is whether they're in the wrong for thinking that way. Since the answer depends on individual family dynamics, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
