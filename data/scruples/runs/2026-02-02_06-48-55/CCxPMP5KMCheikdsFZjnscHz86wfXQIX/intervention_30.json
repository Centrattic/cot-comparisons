      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe question is from someone who's asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for believing that the parent on leave should take over night feedings. The reasoning given is that if one parent is off work for six weeks and the other is still working every morning, it's unfair to split the overnight duties. The user is asking if they're wrong for this opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general expectations around parental leave and responsibilities. Parental leave typically allows one parent to take time off work to care for the newborn. The idea is to give both parents the opportunity to bond with the baby and adjust to their new roles. However, in practice, the parent on leave might take on more daytime responsibilities, while the working parent might handle other tasks when they're home in the evenings.\n\nNow, the author is arguing that since the parent on leave isn't working, they should be the ones getting up at night. The other parent has to get up for work each morning, so maybe they need their rest. But is this a valid assumption? Well, parent on leave might not have the luxury of sleep either, as they're also taking care of the baby during the day. However, they might have more flexibility in their schedule. The working parent, on the other hand, might be more exhausted from the workday and need to be rested for the next day.\n\nBut wait, parental leave is a shared responsibility. Both parents should ideally be involved in the care of the newborn, including night feedings. If the author is suggesting that the parent on leave should handle all the night shifts, that could lead to an imbalance where one parent is overburdened. The working parent might not get enough time to bond with the baby, and the parent on leave might not get adequate rest either.\n\nAnother angle is the physical and mental health of both parents. If the parent on leave is doing all the night feedings, they might become sleep-deprived and stressed, which isn't healthy. The working parent might also be missing out on being part of the baby's care routine, which is important for the child's development and for the parent's emotional well-being.\n\nMoreover, the author's suggestion could be seen as assuming that the parent on leave has more time and is less busy, but in reality, taking care of an infant full-time can be just as demanding as a job. So expecting them to handle all the night feedings might not be fair. It's important to share responsibilities to maintain a healthy balance for both parents.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parent on leave is off work and doesn't have to get up early for an office job, they might have more flexibility in their schedule to adjust their sleep and get up for feedings without the added stress of a morning routine. However, this doesn't mean that they should bear all the responsibility. It's a team effort, and both parents should communicate and find a way that works best for their situation.\n\nIn some cases, the parent on leave might have other commitments, like running errands, managing household tasks, or even caring for other children. So they might not have the same capacity to handle all night feedings. Therefore, expecting them to do so could be unfair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's opinion that the parent on leave should be the one getting up at night might not consider the shared responsibility and the need for both parents to be involved. It's important for both parents to collaborate and find a solution that allows them to share the load, ensuring that neither is overburdened and that both can bond with the baby. Therefore, the author's stance might be inconsiderate of the working parent's needs and the overall balance required in parenting.\n"
