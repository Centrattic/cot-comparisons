      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night, especially when one parent is working and the other isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices and societal norms around parental leave and nighttime duties. In many cases, the parent not working might take on more nighttime responsibilities to allow the working parent to rest for their job. This can help the working parent maintain their job performance and reduce stress.\n\nHowever, every family is different. Some couples might split the duties based on their own preferences or circumstances. The key here is whether there's a mutual agreement and understanding. If the parent on leave is comfortable taking over the nighttime duties, then it's not necessarily wrong. But if there's an expectation without discussion, that could lead to issues.\n\nThe original poster is questioning if they're at fault for thinking this way. The answer depends on context. If they're making an assumption without considering their partner's needs or preferences, they might be in the wrong. But if they're suggesting this as a practical solution for the working parent's well-being, it could be reasonable.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or situational factors. In some cultures, the parent not working is expected to handle more childcare in the early stages. Also, if the parent on leave has chosen to take that time off, they might expect to be involved in the baby's care.\n\nAnother angle is the physical and mental health of both parents. Constant night wakings can be exhausting. If the parent on leave is handling it, the working parent can get more rest, which is beneficial for their job. But if the parent on leave is overburdened, that's a problem too.\n\nThe question doesn't mention any prior agreement or conflict, just the poster's personal opinion. So, the answer would hinge on whether their stance is seen as a valid strategy for the family's situation or if it's imposing an unfair expectation. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but generally, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The key is communication and mutual agreement between the parents.\n"
