      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong. The question is about whether the parent on parental leave should be the one getting up with the baby at night when the other parent is working.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Parental leave can vary by country and workplace policies. In some places, it's common for one parent to take a leave, especially if they're the primary caregiver. The author's argument is that splitting overnights isn't fair because the working parent has to wake up early for work, while the parent on leave is off work for six weeks. So they think the parent on leave should handle the night shifts.\n\nBut is the author right? Well, parental responsibilities often require teamwork. Even if one parent is on leave, they might have other daytime responsibilities, like caring for the baby during the day. Sleep deprivation is a big issue for new parents, and fairness can be subjective. Some might argue that both parents should share the load to maintain the relationship and support each other. However, if the working parent is already stressed from work, maybe the parent on leave should take more of the night duties to let the working parent rest.\n\nCultural norms also play a role. In some cultures, it's expected that the parent not working takes on more nighttime duties. But in others, sharing equally is the norm. There's also the aspect of equal parenting. If both parents want to be involved, they might split nights, even if one is working. But if the parent on leave is already home, maybe they can handle it more.\n\nPersonal circumstances matter too. If the working parent has a demanding job, they might need the rest. The parent on leave, while not working, might still need sleep to manage daytime care. It's a balance. However, the author's stance is that splitting overnights isn't necessary in this scenario. \n\nBut expecting the non-working parent to do all the night shifts could lead to resentment or burnout. It's a tough situation. The answer might depend on the specific context, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that both parents should share responsibilities equally, then the author is wrong. But if we consider the practicality of one parent being off work, the author might be right.\n\nI think the key here is that parental leave is meant to allow one parent to bond with the child, which includes handling nighttime duties. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all. The answer might be that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but it's situational. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe I should consider that teamwork is important, so expecting the non-working parent to do all is unfair. Hmm.\n"
