For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack. The original scenario mentions that all three are sleeping in one room temporarily. The author, who's a newborn, needs a snack at 3 AM, but the roommates (their parents) have all the snacks and aren't working, so waking them isn't affecting their morning schedule.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the author. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby. That's a huge detail that changes everything. As a newborn, the baby's needs are critical. Infants can't go long periods without eating, especially in the early months. Their feeding schedules are frequent, and hunger can lead to discomfort or crying. The parents, being the roommates, are responsible for caring for the baby, which includes feeding them. \n\nThe situation isn't about a roommate waking up others for a personal snack; it's about a baby needing nourishment. The parents are awake at 3 AM anyway, so the baby's feeding is part of the normal care routine. The parents aren't working, so their sleep isn't being impacted by having to feed the baby. The baby isn't at fault here; it's a natural need. Therefore, the answer should be B, No, because the author isn't in the wrong. The initial question might have been confusing without the edit, but once the baby's age is known, it's clear that this is a necessary part of caregiving and not a matter of right or wrong in terms of inconsiderate behavior.\n"
