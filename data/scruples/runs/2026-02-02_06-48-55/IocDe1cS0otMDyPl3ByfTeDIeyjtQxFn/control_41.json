For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The setup is that they're all temporarily in one room because of some reasons. The roommates are a married couple, the user's parents, and they live in Massachusetts. The user is a 6-week-old baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A newborn baby needing a snack at 3 AM. Wait, but babies don't eat snacks. Oh, the user mentions being a newborn, so maybe the original question was a joke or a mistake. But the edit clarifies that the user is a baby. Wait, that can't be right. A real baby can't be asking about waking up roommates. Maybe it's a humorous way to say they're new in the situation? Or maybe it's a typo. But the edit says \"6 week old newborn/baby.\" That seems odd. If the person is a baby, they wouldn't be making decisions to wake up their parents. Unless it's metaphorical.\n\nAssuming it's a literal situation, a baby can't be making a choice to wake up parents for a snack. So perhaps the original Socratic situation is hypothetical, and the edit is a twist. The user's parents (the roommates) aren't working, so they can sleep in. The person is hungry and needs a snack, and if they don't eat, they get hangry. But if they're a baby, they would need to be fed by the parents, not ask for a snack. So maybe the edit is a red herring. Maybe the user is trying to say that the situation is about a newborn baby needing to eat, but the original question is from an adult perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is an adult, but the edit is a joke. Let me re-read the edit: \"State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents.\" So the user is a baby, parents are the roommates. So the situation is a baby waking up parents to feed them at night. But babies can't choose to wake up their parents; they just have needs. So the question is, is a baby in the wrong for needing to eat and waking up parents? Which would be a humorous take on the AITA format. \n\nBut since the user is a baby, they can't be blamed. However, in the original scenario, the person is acting as an adult. The edit seems to be an April Fools' joke, making the situation absurd. So the real answer would depend on the original scenario without the edit. \n\nIf we take the original question seriously (before the edit), the person is an adult roommate waking up their sleeping roommates (parents) every night at 2-3 AM for a snack. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The person claims they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat. The key factors are: \n\n- Is it reasonable to wake others for a snack? \n- Do they have access to food without waking others?\n- Are the roommates affected significantly?\n\nThe person says they don't have easy access to food, so they have to wake someone up. If they can't access food another way, maybe it's understandable. But waking up people every night is disruptive. However, if the roommates aren't working and can sleep late, maybe the disruption isn't as bad. But repeatedly waking them up could still be considered inconsiderate. \n\nIn typical roommate situations, respecting each other's sleep is important. If the person can't access food without waking others, maybe they should find a different solution, like having their own snacks stored somewhere. But if that's impossible due to the living arrangement, then it's a different story. \n\nThe answer might be B (No) if the person has no alternative. But if they could find another way, maybe A (Yes). However, the edit complicates things by making the person a baby, which is a joke. But since the user wants the answer based on the original question with the edit, which makes it a baby, the answer would be different. A baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. But the original scenario is from an adult's perspective. \n\nThis is confusing. The correct approach is to take the edit into account. Since the user is a baby, technically, they are not in the wrong. However, the original question is structured as an adult's dilemma. But since the user added the edit to clarify they're a baby, the answer would be B (No). But the user might be trying to trick us. However, according to the instructions, we need to consider the scenario as given, including the edit. So the answer is B.\n"
