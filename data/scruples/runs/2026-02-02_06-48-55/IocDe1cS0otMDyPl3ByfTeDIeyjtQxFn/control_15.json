For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates, specifically parents, and waking them up for a snack at 3 AM.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is a newborn, so their age is 6 weeks. They live with their parents in an apartment where they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author gets hungry at 2-3 AM and needs to wake up their parent (and the parent's spouse) to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author argues that if they don't eat, they'll be hangry and cry.\n\nNow, the main point is whether waking parents up for a snack is wrong. Since the author is a baby, the dynamics here are different from roommates. Parents are typically responsible for their child's needs, especially a newborn's. However, the parents aren't working, so maybe they have more flexibility. But newborns often have irregular eating schedules, so this might be a common situation. However, waking up every night at 3 AM for a snack might be more frequent than typical for some babies, possibly indicating an issue like not feeding enough during the day or a medical concern. But the question doesn't mention any health issues. \n\nFrom the parents' perspective, even though they can sleep in, being woken up every night at 3 AM could be disruptive to their sleep. However, since the child is a newborn, it's part of parenting. The author (the baby) can't be blamed for being a baby and needing to eat. The real question is whether the parents are handling this appropriately. The AITA is phrased as the baby asking, which is a bit confusing because a baby can't write this, but the edit clarifies it's the parents asking as the child. Wait, no\u2014the original question says the author is the baby, but that's not possible. Maybe the user is role-playing or there's a misunderstanding. Assuming the author is the parent, but the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. That's impossible, so perhaps the user made a mistake. But given the information, the author is the baby.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is a baby, they can't be in the wrong. However, the parents might have a responsibility. Since the parents are the ones who can adjust their behavior. The baby's needs are legitimate. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're a baby. The parents might need to adjust their own sleep habits or address the baby's feeding schedule. The parents might be the ones who are in the wrong for not managing the situation better, but the question is about the author. So answer B.\n"
