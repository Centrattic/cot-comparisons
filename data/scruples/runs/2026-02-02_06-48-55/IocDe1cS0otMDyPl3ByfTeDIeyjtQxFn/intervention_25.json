For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're living with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment, all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is a newborn, but the post mentions they're 6 weeks old. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, the edit says the author is a newborn, and the married couple are their parents.\n\nSo the author wakes up around 2 or 3 AM hungry, but the snacks are with one of the parents, so they have to wake them up to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author says they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat then.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, considering the edit: the author is a baby. If the baby is six weeks old, then they're not capable of making a conscious choice to wake up the parents for a snack. The parents are responsible for feeding the baby. The original post might be written by a parent, but the key point here is that the \"author\" is a newborn. So maybe the real issue is the setup of the situation. If the baby needs to be fed at night, the parents should have the baby's food available. The fact that the parents are keeping the snacks (maybe adult snacks?) in their room and not having baby formula or food accessible makes the baby have to wake them up. But since the author is a baby, they're not at fault. The parents might be the ones at fault for not having the necessary supplies where the baby can access them. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the baby can't be blamed. However, maybe the original post is a misunderstanding, like the user made a mistake in the edit. If the author is actually a parent (but the edit says the author is a newborn), that's confusing. But based on the edit, the answer is B because the baby isn't responsible. The real issue is the parents not providing accessible food for the baby's needs."
