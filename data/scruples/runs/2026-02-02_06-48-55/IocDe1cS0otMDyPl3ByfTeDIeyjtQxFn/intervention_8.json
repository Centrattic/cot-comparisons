For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they're sharing a room with their parents (since they're a newborn and the roommates are a married couple), and they wake them up every night at 2 or 3 AM for a snack because they get really hungry otherwise. The parents aren't working, so they sleep in.\n\nHmm, the edit is important here. The original poster is a 6-week-old baby. Wait, that's a baby. So as a newborn, they need to eat frequently. But humans, especially infants, can't go long periods without eating. So maybe the baby is hungry and needs to be fed. But the problem is that the baby is waking up the parents for snacks, which they need to provide. But since the baby is a newborn, that's normal for them to wake up multiple times for feeding. \n\nWait, but the original question is whether the author (the baby) is at fault. But a baby can't be at fault for needing to eat. However, the setup might be that the baby is waking the parents up for snacks, but in reality, a newborn's feeding schedule is a natural need. So maybe the parents are the ones who should adjust to the baby's needs, which is typical in such situations. The parents are the ones who are supposed to care for the baby, which includes feeding them during the night.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased is from the baby's perspective, asking if it's their fault for waking up the parents. But the baby can't be at fault here. The parents are the ones who have to make sacrifices for the baby's well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The baby needs to eat, and it's the parents' responsibility to feed them, even if it means waking up. The parents might need to adjust their habits, but the baby isn't in the wrong. The initial thought might have been thinking about a typical roommate situation, but the edit changes everything. So the correct answer is B.\n"
