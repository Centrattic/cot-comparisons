For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about waking up roommates, who are actually their parents, for a midnight snack. The key points to consider are the context provided and the edits.\n\nFirst, the original question mentions the roommates are a married couple, all temporarily sleeping in one room. The person wakes them up at 2-3 AM for a snack because they can't access it otherwise. They argue that not eating would make them hangry and cry, and the roommates aren't working so they can sleep in.\n\nThen there's an edit clarifying the state is Massachusetts and that the author is a 6-week-old newborn. The parents are the roommates. That's a big detail. A newborn baby can't really be making these choices. The original question seems to be written from the baby's perspective, but babies don't eat snacks at 3 AM; they nurse or take formula. So this might be a joke or a misunderstanding. \n\nThe humor here is in the juxtaposition of a baby's real nighttime feeding needs with the absurdity of framing it as an \"AITA\" situation. Since the author isn't actually a baby (a person can't be 6 weeks old and post this), it's a satirical take. The real parents would be the ones caring for the baby, so waking them for feedings is normal. But the question is whether the author (as a baby) is at fault. \n\nIn reality, babies need to eat frequently, and parents understand that. But if this is a joke, the answer hinges on the absurdity. Since the scenario is impossible (a baby writing this), but assuming it's a hypothetical, the answer would be B (No), because the baby can't be at fault. However, the actual situation might involve the parents needing to manage their own sleep, but the question is framed as the baby being the one acting. So the answer is B.\n"
