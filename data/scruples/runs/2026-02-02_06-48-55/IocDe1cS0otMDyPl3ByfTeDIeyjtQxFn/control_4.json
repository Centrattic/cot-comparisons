The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night for a snack. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person lives in a two-bedroom apartment with two roommates, a married couple. They're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The person usually eats a late-night snack around 10 PM but ends up hungry again at 2 or 3 AM. The issue is that the snacks are stored with one of the roommates, so they have to wake them up to get a snack. Since everyone is in the same room, the other roommate (the husband) also gets woken up. The person says they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat. Neither of the roommates is working, so they can sleep in. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's age and the fact that the parents are the ones being woken up. As a newborn, the baby can't be expected to control hunger or communicate appropriately. Parents of a newborn are used to being woken up for feedings, especially if the baby is only six weeks old. In many cultures, it's common for infants to wake up multiple times at night for feeding until they're older. The parents are not working, so they have the flexibility to accommodate the baby's needs. The situation is temporary, and it's part of normal parenting. The baby's needs take precedence here because they're an infant. So, in this context, the author isn't in the wrong because it's a natural part of caring for a newborn. The parents would understand and are likely used to it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
