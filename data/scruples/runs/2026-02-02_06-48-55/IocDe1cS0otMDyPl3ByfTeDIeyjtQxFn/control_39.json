For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for waking up their roommates, who are their parents, for a 3 AM snack. The key points here are the living situation and the age of the author.\n\nFirst, the author is a 6-week-old newborn, which is a critical detail. As a newborn, they can't really make decisions or interact with their parents in a typical way. The parents are the ones responsible for the baby's care, including feeding. The scenario mentions that the parents aren't working, so their schedule is flexible. Newborns often need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours, which is normal. The parents would be expected to feed the baby regardless of the time. \n\nThe original question about being \"in the wrong\" doesn't apply here because the baby isn't making a choice to wake up the parents. It's a natural part of caring for an infant. The parents are there to meet the baby's needs, which includes feeding at night. The roommates mentioned in the original scenario are actually the parents, so the dynamic is different when the author is a baby.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), as the baby isn't at fault. The parents are responsible for their care, and waking them up for feeding is necessary and part of parenting.\n"
