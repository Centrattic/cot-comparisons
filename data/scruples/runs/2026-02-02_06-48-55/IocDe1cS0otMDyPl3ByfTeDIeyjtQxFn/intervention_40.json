For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a newborn baby, and their parents living in a temporary setup where they all sleep in one room. The author needs a snack at 3 AM but has to wake up their parents because they don't have access to food otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a newborn, so their needs are essential. However, the parents are not working, so maybe they can sleep in. But the author is waking them up every night, which could disrupt their rest. Since the author is an infant, they can't help their hunger and it's necessary to feed them. But the parents might be stressed if they're constantly woken up, even if they are not working. \n\nWait, the parents are the roommates here. The author is a baby, but the question is framed as if the author is a person asking about their actions. Maybe there's a typo in the edit? Wait, the original post says the author is a 6-week-old newborn, so the person is the baby. But the question is written as if the author is a person making a choice to wake up the parents for a snack. That's confusing. How can a newborn be making a choice? Unless there's a misunderstanding in the edit. Wait, maybe the original poster wrote that they are the baby for humorous effect, but the real situation is about a baby being fed. But the user is asking if the author (the baby) is in the wrong. But a baby isn't responsible for their actions. However, the parent's perspective might be considered here. \n\nBut the way the question is phrased, the author is the one waking the parents up. If the author is the baby, then the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. The parents are responsible for feeding the baby. So in that case, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The parents should be accommodating. However, if the author is actually an adult who is pretending to be a baby, then maybe it's a joke, but the user is asking about the real scenario. Given the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby,\" it's likely the author is the baby. So the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat at night. Therefore, the answer would be B. However, maybe the user intended the author to be a person, but the edit changes that. Need to clarify the scenario. Since the edit is part of the question, I have to take it into account. So the author is the baby. The baby needs to eat, which naturally wakes the parents. So the baby isn't in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
