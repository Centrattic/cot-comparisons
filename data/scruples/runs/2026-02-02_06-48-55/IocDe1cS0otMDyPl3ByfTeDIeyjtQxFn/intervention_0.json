For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a 3 AM snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the author needs to get a snack from their parent, which wakes both parents up. The author is a newborn, so maybe that's a key point here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need to eat at 3 AM because otherwise they get hangry and cry. But since they're a newborn, they probably can't get up on their own or access food without help. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the author is waking them up every night. The parents might be getting disturbed by the newborn's feeding schedule, which is typical for infants. However, the original question is from the author's perspective, but the edit clarifies they're a baby. \n\nWait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the person writing is actually a baby? That's a bit confusing because AITA posts are usually from adults. Maybe it's a hypothetical written from the baby's point of view. But logically, a newborn can't write an AITA post. The parents are the ones who would be responsible for the baby's needs. So if the baby is waking up for feedings, it's normal and expected for parents to take care of that. The parents can't really be blamed for getting up to feed their baby. So in this case, the author (as a baby) isn't in the wrong because it's natural and necessary for their development. The parents are actually supposed to assist with the baby's needs, even if it interrupts their sleep. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The confusion comes from the initial scenario where the author is a person, but the edit changes the perspective entirely. The key here is recognizing the edit's implication that the author is a baby, making the situation standard parenting duties.\n"
