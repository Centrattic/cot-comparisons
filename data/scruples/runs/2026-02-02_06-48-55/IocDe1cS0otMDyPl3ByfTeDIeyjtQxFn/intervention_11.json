For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM for a snack. The author is a newborn, so they're a baby. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby needs to eat, but the parents have the snacks and the baby can't get them alone.\n\nFirst, since the author is a baby, they can't be held responsible like an adult. Infants don't have the capacity to make moral decisions. Their needs are biological. So the question of being in the wrong doesn't really apply to a baby. But the user is framing it as a general situation, maybe for hypothetical reasons.\n\nThe parents have to feed the baby, so they probably expect that they'll be woken up for feedings. If the baby is being fed by the parents at night, that's normal. However, the twist here is that the snacks (like baby food or formula) are stored in a way that the baby can't access them alone. But since the baby is a newborn, they can't access anything on their own. So the parents have to be woken up to feed the baby.\n\nIn that case, the baby isn't at fault. The situation might be a bit different if the baby was an adult, but since it's a newborn, the parents are responsible for their care. The baby's need to eat is essential, and not getting fed would cause distress. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The key here is the age of the author. Even if in a normal AITA scenario, but since it's a baby, the dynamics are different.\n"
