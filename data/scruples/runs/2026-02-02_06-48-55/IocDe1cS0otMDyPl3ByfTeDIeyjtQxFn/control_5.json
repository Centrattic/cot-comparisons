For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a newborn baby living with their parents in a shared room. The baby gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and has to wake the parents up to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby's hunger is causing them to be hangry and even cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is only 6 weeks old, which is really young. Newborns have small stomachs and need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours. The parents are the ones with the snacks, so the baby can't get to them otherwise. The baby is waking the parents up every night for a snack, which is understandable given their age and needs. \n\nBut the question is whether the baby is at fault. Since the baby is a newborn, they can't control their feeding schedule. It's a biological necessity to eat that often. The parents are their caregivers, so it's part of the parents' role to take care of the baby's needs, including feeding them during the night. The baby isn't doing this out of choice\u2014they're just following their natural needs. \n\nThe parents aren't working, so they have the time to accommodate the baby's schedule. Even though waking up every night is tough, the baby can't help it. It's also important to note that the baby is in a shared room temporarily, which might be a contributing factor. The situation is a temporary arrangement, so maybe the parents can adjust for now. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the parents could find a way to make the baby's feeding easier without waking them up each time. For example, having baby food or snacks within reach if the baby could access them, but the question states that the parents have all the snacks and the baby can't get to them. So the baby has no choice but to wake the parents. \n\nConsidering all that, the baby isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling a basic survival need. The parents are responsible for caring for an infant, which includes feeding them when they're hungry. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
