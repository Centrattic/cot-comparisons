For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is a bit unique because the roommates are actually the author's parents, and the author is a newborn. Hmm, the original post mentions that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the parents have all the snacks. The author gets very hungry at night and needs to wake them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so they're not an adult. The parents aren't working, so they might have more flexibility. But newborns typically need to eat frequently, like every few hours. However, the post says the snack is at 3 AM, which might be part of the parents' night. But since the parents are not working, maybe they can adjust their sleep. \n\nBut wait, the parents are the roommates. The question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author is a baby, they can't be at fault. The real issue is the parents' perspective. However, the question is phrased as if the author is an adult. The edit clarifies that the author is a baby. So the answer would be that the baby isn't in the wrong because they can't control their feeding schedule. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby. So the answer should be B (No). The parents might have the problem, but the baby isn't at fault.\n"
