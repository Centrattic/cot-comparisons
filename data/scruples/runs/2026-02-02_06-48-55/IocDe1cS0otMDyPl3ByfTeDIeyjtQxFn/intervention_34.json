For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The author is a 6-week-old baby, so that's a key detail here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is in a temporary living situation with their parents, all in one room. The parents aren't working, so their sleep schedule isn't as crucial as if they had to wake up early for jobs. The baby gets hungry at 3 AM and needs to be fed, but they don't have easy access to food, so they have to wake up the parents. The baby mentions that not eating would make them hangry and even cry because of hunger. \n\nNow, since the author is a newborn, they can't really be blamed for needing to eat. Infants have frequent feeding needs, and it's a natural part of their development. However, the question is framed as if the baby is making a choice to wake up the parents. But realistically, a baby can't control their hunger or the timing of their meals. They need to eat when they're hungry, which for a newborn can be every few hours.\n\nThe parents are the ones responsible for feeding the baby, so waking up to feed them is part of their role. The baby isn't at fault here. The situation is temporary, and the parents are not working, so the disruption might be less burdensome for them. The baby's health and well-being are priorities, and going hungry would be detrimental. \n\nBut wait, the original question from the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But in reality, the baby isn't making a conscious choice. The parents should adjust their schedules to accommodate the baby's needs. So, the answer would be that the baby isn't in the wrong. The parents are responsible for the baby's care, so waking them up is necessary, not a fault of the baby. Therefore, the correct answer is B (No).\n"
