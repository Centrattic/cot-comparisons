For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The author is a newborn, so they can't help it. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author can't access food themselves because it's all with one parent.\n\nHmm. Since the author is a baby, they don't have control over their actions. They need to eat when hungry. The parents are their roommates but also their parents, so maybe the situation is different. Roommate rules might not apply the same way. The parents are supposed to take care of the baby's needs, even at night. But the question is framed as AITA, which usually involves adult roommates. The edit clarifies that the parents are the roommates. \n\nIn a typical roommate scenario, waking someone up for snacks every night might be considered inconsiderate. But since the author is an infant, it's not their fault. The parents should understand that a baby can't control their hunger. The parents aren't working, so they can adjust their sleep. The author isn't at fault because they can't help it. The answer should be B (No), because the baby isn't responsible for their actions. The parents, as caregivers, need to accommodate the baby's needs.\n"
