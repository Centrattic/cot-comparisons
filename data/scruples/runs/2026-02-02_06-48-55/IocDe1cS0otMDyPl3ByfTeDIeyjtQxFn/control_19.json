For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The original situation says that the person lives with two roommates, a married couple, and they're all temporarily in one room. The author gets hungry at 2-3 AM and has to wake up one roommate (who has the snacks) to get something to eat. This usually wakes the other roommate too. The author mentions that without the snack, they'd be hangry and even cry from hunger. Also, the roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The edit adds that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the age of the person and the relationship dynamics. A 6-week-old baby can't really have the same responsibilities or expectations as an adult. The parents are likely the primary caregivers, so it's their responsibility to feed the baby. The baby can't cook or access food on their own, which is a natural part of being an infant. Waking up at night to feed a baby is a common occurrence; parents often adjust their sleep patterns to accommodate their child's needs. \n\nIn this case, the baby is the one needing the snack, which is actually a meal. Since they can't eat later without becoming cranky, the parents are expected to provide the necessary care. The parents aren't working, so they have the flexibility to stay up or adjust their schedule. The situation is part of typical parenting, where nighttime feedings are normal, especially for a newborn. \n\nThe original question might have been a bit confusing because it's framed as an adult roommate situation, but the edit clarifies that the person is a baby. This changes the entire context. So, the author (the baby) is not in the wrong because it's the parents' responsibility to care for their child's needs, including feeding them at night. The parents are in this situation by choice, as they're the ones who had a baby, and they should expect that their sleep will be disrupted during the early months. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), as the baby isn't at fault here. The parents are the ones responsible for their child's well-being, and waking up to feed the baby is part of that responsibility.\n"
