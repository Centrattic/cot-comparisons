For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation involves a two-bedroom apartment where the roommates (a married couple) are temporarily all sleeping in one room. The author, who is a newborn (as clarified in the edit), wakes up hungry and has to get a snack from one of the roommates, which ends up waking both. The parents aren't working, so maybe their sleep isn't as crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a baby, so their behavior isn't intentional. Newborns have limited control over their schedules and needs. The parents are the roommates here, so the dynamic is different from typical roommates. The main issue is whether waking them up for a snack is unreasonable. \n\nBabies need to eat frequently, especially if they're only six weeks old. It's a natural part of their development. The parents, being non-working, might have more flexibility. But even so, constant nighttime interruptions could affect their rest. However, given that they are the baby's parents, it's part of their responsibility to care for the child's needs, which includes feeding them. \n\nThe original question is from the perspective of the person (the baby) waking up the roommates. But since the baby isn't making a conscious choice here, the concept of being \"in the wrong\" doesn't really apply. The parents might feel the need to adjust their sleeping arrangements or find a way to make feeding the baby easier without waking the other parent each time. But the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The situation is a result of being a newborn with natural needs. The parents might need to adapt, but the baby can't be blamed for this.\n"
