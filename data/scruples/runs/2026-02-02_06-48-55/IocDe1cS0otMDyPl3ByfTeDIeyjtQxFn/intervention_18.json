For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily living in one room, the author is a newborn, and the parents have all the snacks. The author gets really hungry and cranky if they don't eat, but the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so maybe they can't help it? But the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Wait, that's a contradiction. The original post says the author is a newborn, but the edit clarifies that the married couple are the parents. So the author is a baby, and the parents are the roommates. But how does a 6-week-old baby write this? That part is confusing. Maybe it's a joke or a mistake. Assuming it's a mistake, perhaps the author is an adult who's acting like a baby, but that's unclear.\n\nIf the author is an adult living with parents, waking them up at 3 AM for a snack every night might be considered inconsiderate. Even if the parents aren't working, being woken up multiple times could disrupt their sleep and affect their well-being. However, if the author is a newborn baby, they can't be blamed for needing to eat. But the original post mentions the author being hungry and crying because of hunger, which is typical for a baby. The parents would need to attend to the baby's needs regardless. But the edit complicates things.\n\nThe key points are: the author's age (if a baby, not responsible; if an adult, responsibility applies), the necessity of the snack (critical for health?), and the impact on others. If the author is an adult, waking up parents every night for a snack might be inconsiderate unless there's a medical reason. If it's a baby, the parents are responsible regardless. The confusion comes from the age contradiction. Since the edit says the author is a newborn, but the scenario describes an adult living with roommates, there's a mix-up. Assuming the correct context is that the author is an adult, then yes, they're in the wrong. If the author is a baby, not in the wrong. The answer depends on the correct interpretation of the edit. Given the edit states the author is a newborn, but the situation is an adult's perspective, maybe it's a trick question. However, a newborn can't write this, so perhaps the author is an adult using that as a humorous excuse. Therefore, the answer might be A (wrong) because as an adult, waking parents up nightly for snacks is inconsiderate.\n"
