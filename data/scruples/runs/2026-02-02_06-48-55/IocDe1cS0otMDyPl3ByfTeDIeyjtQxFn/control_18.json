For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents. They're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The baby gets hungry at 2 or 3 AM and needs a snack, but doesn't have easy access to food, so they have to wake one of the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby says they get \"hangry\" and even cry if they don't eat, which affects the rest of their night.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the baby's age and the parents' situation. At 6 weeks old, a baby's feeding schedule is typically every 2-3 hours, so needing a snack at 2 or 3 AM is normal. The parents are the ones with the snacks, so maybe it's part of their role as caregivers to feed the baby. Also, since they're not working, they might have more flexibility to accommodate the baby's needs, even if it means waking up. \n\nBut wait, the original question is phrased as the author (the baby) asking if they're at fault. From a human perspective, a baby can't be in the wrong here because they're an infant and their needs are biological. The parents are expected to care for the baby's needs, even at night. The baby isn't choosing to wake them up intentionally; it's just their natural need. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No) because the baby isn't at fault. The situation is normal for a newborn, and the parents are responsible for feeding them regardless of the time. The parents might be tired, but that's part of having a new baby. The baby's needs come first in this scenario.\n"
