For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is a bit unique because the author is a newborn, and the roommates are their parents. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, which immediately changes the perspective. Babies can't control their hunger or sleep schedules. They need to eat frequently, especially at night. The parents are the ones who are supposed to care for the baby's needs, including feeding them.\n\nThe original question mentions that the parents aren't working, so they have more flexibility. Waking up for a baby's feeding is part of parenting. However, the question was phrased as if the author is choosing to wake them up, but in reality, a baby can't make that choice. The parents are the ones who should be attending to the baby's needs. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that without eating, they'd be hangry and cry. But since it's a baby, crying is the only way to signal hunger. The parents are responsible for feeding the baby, so the baby isn't at fault here. The parents might be frustrated if they aren't getting enough sleep, but that's part of having a newborn. \n\nThe initial thought that the author is in the wrong might come from a scenario where an adult is waking others up unnecessarily. But since the author is a baby, the dynamic is different. Babies can't be held responsible for their actions. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
