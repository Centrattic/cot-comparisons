For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates for a snack. Let me read the details again.\n\nThe setup is that there are three people in one room: the author and their two roommates, who are a married couple. The author, who is a newborn, needs a snack around 2-3 AM but can't access food without waking up the roommates. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author argues that not eating would make them hangry and even cry. The state is Massachusetts.\n\nHmm, the key points here. First, the author is a newborn. Wait, that edit is crucial. The original question didn't mention that. If the author is a baby, then the situation is different. Parents have a responsibility to care for their infant's needs, including feeding. But the parents are the roommates here. So maybe the baby can't be blamed for their actions, but the question is about the parents. Wait, the author is the baby, but the question is from the baby's perspective? That's a bit confusing. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author (the baby) is in the wrong. However, a baby can't be in the wrong in a moral sense; they can't be held responsible. But the setup is presented as a typical AITA scenario where the person is asking if they're in the wrong. The parents might feel interrupted, but the baby's needs are essential. However, the parents are responsible for the baby's care, so maybe they should adjust to handle the feeding without waking each other. But the parents might be the ones who are in the wrong if they don't accommodate the baby's needs. Wait, but the question is about the author (the baby) waking them up. So the answer would be no, the baby isn't in the wrong because they can't help it. However, the original answer the user gave was thinking the author is wrong, but after the edit, the situation changes.\n\nSo considering the edit, the answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the baby's needs are necessary. Parents should adapt to their baby's schedule as part of caregiving. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
