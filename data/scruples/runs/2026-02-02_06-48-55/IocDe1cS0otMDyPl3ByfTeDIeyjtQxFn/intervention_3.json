For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person (who is a newborn) lives with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment. They're all sleeping in one room temporarily. The person wakes up hungry at 2-3 AM, needs to eat, but the parents have all the snacks. So they wake the parents up every night to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the person gets really cranky if they don't eat at that time. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nWait, hold on. The edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. Oh, that's a big detail I missed. So the original question is from a baby's perspective? That's a twist. The parents are the roommates. The baby needs to eat at night, which is normal for infants. But the parents have the snacks, so the baby has to wake them up for food. \n\nBut the question is, is the baby in the wrong? The original question is phrased as if the author is a person living with roommates, but the edit reveals they're a newborn. So the \"roommates\" are actually the parents, and the baby is asking if they're at fault for waking them up for snacks. \n\nSo from the baby's side, they're just doing what's necessary for survival. Newborns typically need to eat every few hours. However, in the original scenario, the baby is described as needing to eat because they get hangry if they wait. But since the baby is a newborn, they can't really do anything else but wake up the parents to feed. So the parents are supposed to care for the baby's needs, even at night. \n\nIn reality, parents are expected to feed their infants during the night. The baby isn't at fault here; it's a natural part of parenting. The parents should be attending to the baby's needs. The original scenario's framing is a bit confusing, but once you realize the author is a newborn, it's clear that they're not in the wrong. The parents are the ones who need to adjust to the baby's schedule. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The baby can't help needing to eat at night, and the parents are responsible for their care.\n"
