For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about waking up roommates for a snack. The key points here are that the person is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents. The baby is waking up hungry at 2-3 AM because they don't have easy access to snacks. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the person. Since they're a newborn, their needs are different. A baby can't help it if they wake up hungry. The parents, as roommates, are taking care of the baby, so this is part of parenting. The baby doesn't have control over their hunger cycle. The parents might be adjusting to the situation, but it's normal for infants to need frequent feedings. The question is whether the baby is at fault, but since they're a baby, it's not their responsibility. The parents should be the ones managing the baby's needs, even if it means waking up. The real issue might be the setup\u2014maybe the baby doesn't have their own snacks, but a baby can't be expected to have snacks. The parents should be the ones feeding the baby. So the answer here is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're a baby and can't be held responsible. The parents need to adjust to their baby's needs. The original post might be written by the parents, but the edit says the author is the baby, which is a joke, but in reality, a baby can't post. But assuming the scenario is as stated, the answer is B.\n"
