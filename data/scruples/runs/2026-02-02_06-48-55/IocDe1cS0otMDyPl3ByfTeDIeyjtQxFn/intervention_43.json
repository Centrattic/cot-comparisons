For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is a bit unique because the roommates are actually the author's parents, and the author is a newborn baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, which means they can't really help their situation. Newborns don't have the ability to make choices or understand the consequences of their actions. They eat when they're hungry, regardless of the time. The parents, being the roommates, aren't working, so their sleep schedule isn't as strict. The author mentions being hangry if they don't eat, which makes sense for a baby.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is a baby, they can't be held responsible for waking up others. The parents are aware of the situation and are taking care of the baby's needs. The real issue here might be the living arrangements, but that's more of a practical problem rather than the baby being at fault. The parents probably understand that a newborn has these needs and can't help it. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions are unreasonable or inconsiderate. But in this case, the author isn't making a choice; it's a natural need of a baby. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. The parents are adults and should handle the situation as part of caring for their newborn. The situation might need adjustments, but the baby isn't the one at fault.\n"
