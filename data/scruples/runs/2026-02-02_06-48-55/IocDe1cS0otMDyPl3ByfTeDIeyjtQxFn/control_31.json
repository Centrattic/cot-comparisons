For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents. \n\nFirst, the original question says they live in a two-bedroom apartment with two roommates (a married couple), and they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is waking them up for a snack because they don't have access to food otherwise. They mention being hangry and crying if they don't eat.\n\nBut the key detail in the edit is that the author is a newborn. So, the situation is a baby waking up parents for feedings. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The question is whether the baby is at fault.\n\nWell, babies can't control their eating schedules. They need to eat frequently, especially at 6 weeks old. The parents are the ones responsible for feeding them. Even if the baby is waking them up multiple times a night, it's a normal part of having an infant. The parents chose to have a baby, so they should expect this. The baby isn't doing anything wrong; it's natural for their age. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're an infant and parents are expected to care for their baby's needs, even if it disrupts their sleep.\n"
