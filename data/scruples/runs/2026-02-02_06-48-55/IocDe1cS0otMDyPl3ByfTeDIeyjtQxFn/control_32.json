For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is living with their parents, all in one room temporarily. They get hungry around 2 or 3 AM and have to wake up their parents to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. But the question is whether the author is at fault for waking them up every night.\n\nFirst, the edit is important here: the author is a 6-week-old baby. That changes things a lot. Newborns have different needs compared to adults. They need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours. But the original post mentions a 3 AM snack, which for a 6-week-old is part of their normal feeding schedule. However, the parents are the ones providing the snack, which might imply that the baby is being fed by them. But if the baby is this young, they can't really \"wake up\" for a snack on their own; they need to be fed. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here in the original post's framing. The parents are probably the ones getting up to feed the baby, but the baby's needs are essential. \n\nBut wait, the original post says the author is the one who has to wake up the roommates (the parents) to get a snack. If the author is a baby, they can't really choose to wake up; they might be crying or needing to be fed. But the way it's written sounds like the author is an adult making a choice to wake up the parents for a snack. That's conflicting with the edit. The edit clarifies that the author is a newborn, so the initial description might be from the perspective of an adult, but that's not possible. Maybe there's a mistake in the original post's framing. \n\nAssuming the edit is accurate, the baby's needs are legitimate. Newborns require frequent feeding, and parents are used to getting up for that. However, the post mentions a \"snack,\" which is a bit odd for a 6-week-old. Typically, they would be breastfed or bottle-fed, not having solid snacks. So maybe there's a translation or framing issue here. Perhaps the parents are giving the baby something other than regular feeds, but regardless, the core issue is the baby needing to be fed at night. \n\nIn that case, the parents are the ones who need to wake up to feed their baby. The baby isn't at fault for needing to eat; it's a natural biological need. Therefore, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. However, the question is phrased as if the author is an adult, which is confusing. But given the edit, the answer should be B (No) because the baby has a legitimate need, and parents are expected to care for their child's needs, even at night.\n"
