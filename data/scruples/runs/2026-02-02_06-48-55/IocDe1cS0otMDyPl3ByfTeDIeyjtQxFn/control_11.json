For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is a 6-week-old baby, wakes up their parents (who are roommates) at 2 or 3 AM for a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby gets hangry and even cries because they're so hungry if they wait until morning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is very young, only six weeks old. At that age, it's normal for infants to wake up frequently during the night for feeding. Their stomachs are small, so they need to eat more often. It's part of their development and necessary for their health and growth. From what I know, newborns typically feed every 2-3 hours, so waking up at 2 or 3 AM is within the normal range.\n\nThe parents, being the roommates, are used to this. The baby can't access food on their own, so they have to rely on the parents to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they don't have an early schedule to maintain. Even if they are disturbed, they can still sleep in later. The baby's need for food is urgent and necessary for well-being, not just a preference.\n\nNow, considering the AITA aspect. The parents are the ones responsible for caring for the baby. Waking up to feed the baby is part of their role as caregivers. It's not something they can avoid, especially when the baby is in a critical developmental stage. The baby isn't making a choice here; their body requires the feeding. So, the baby isn't doing anything wrong. The situation is not the baby's fault. The question of being \"in the wrong\" doesn't apply here because the baby is acting on a natural, biological need.\n\nThe parents might be feeling tired, but that's part of parenting a newborn. It's common for new parents to have disrupted sleep. The answer should take into account that the baby's actions are necessary and not a choice they can control. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
