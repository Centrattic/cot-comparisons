For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves waking up roommates for a 3 AM snack. The key details here are that the person is a newborn, so \"6 weeks old baby,\" and the roommates are their parents. They all temporarily live in one room because of unknown reasons. The baby gets hungry at night and has to wake up the parents to get a snack, which also wakes the other parent. The parents aren't working, so their sleep isn't affected by the baby's feeding schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is a newborn, which naturally requires frequent feedings. Newborns can't sleep for long stretches and need to eat every few hours. The parents, as roommates, are already taking care of the baby, so waking up for feedings is part of their routine. The baby isn't doing this out of laziness but out of biological necessity. \n\nIn the original post, the user is a human, but the edit clarifies that the author is a newborn. So the question is whether a newborn is in the wrong for waking up their parents for feedings. But babies can't be held morally responsible for their actions. They don't have the cognitive ability to understand right or wrong. The real issue here is whether the parents are in the wrong, but the question is about the author (the baby). \n\nSince the baby is the one asking, and considering that it's a natural part of being an infant, the answer would be that the baby isn't in the wrong. The parents might have their own frustrations, but the baby's actions are necessary for survival and growth. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), because the baby can't be at fault for needing to eat. The situation is a normal part of having a newborn, and the parents are aware of the circumstances. The baby doesn't have alternative options for getting food without waking the parents, and the parents aren't working, so their schedule is flexible. Therefore, the baby isn't in the wrong here.\n"
