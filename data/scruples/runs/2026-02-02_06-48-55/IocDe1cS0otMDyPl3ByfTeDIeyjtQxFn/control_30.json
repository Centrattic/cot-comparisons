For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for waking their roommates up to get a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily in one room, the snacks are with one roommate, and the author is a newborn. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Oh, that's a big detail I missed. So, the original question is from a baby's perspective? That makes a difference.\n\nSo, the baby wakes up hungry at 2 or 3 AM and needs food, which is why the parents are being woken up. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby can't help being hungry and needing to eat. Since the baby is an infant, it's natural to need frequent feedings. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby, so waking up to feed them is part of their role. The baby isn't at fault here because they can't help it. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong. The initial scenario seems like a typical situation with a newborn, so the answer is B.\n"
