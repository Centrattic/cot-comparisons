For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a newborn baby, living with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment where all three are temporarily sleeping in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and needs to wake up the parents, who are not working, to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby is waking them up every night. The question is whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, the baby is an infant, so they don't have control over their actions. They need to eat when they're hungry, which is a basic human need. However, the setup is that the parents have all the snacks, and the baby can't access them, so they have to be fed by the parents. Since the parents aren't working, maybe they can adjust their schedule? But newborns typically need to eat every few hours regardless of the parents' schedule. The parents might be adjusting their sleep to accommodate the baby's feeding needs, which is normal for new parents. But in this case, the baby is considered the author here, which is a bit odd because a baby can't write, so maybe it's a humorous or hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe key points are that the baby's need for food is essential, and the parents should be handling feedings as part of their role in caring for the infant. The parents might be getting enough sleep since they aren't working, but waking up multiple times a night is still tiring. However, it's expected for parents of a newborn to adjust their routines to meet the baby's needs. So, the baby isn't in the wrong because they can't help their hunger, and feeding is necessary. The parents are responsible for providing care. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, but the original question from the user says \"I think the author is in the wrong,\" but the user is asking for my opinion. But since the author is a baby, it's not their fault. The parents are the ones responsible, so the answer should be B.\n"
