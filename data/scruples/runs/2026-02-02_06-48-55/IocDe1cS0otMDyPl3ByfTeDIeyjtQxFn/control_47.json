For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the person needs to eat at 2 or 3 AM. They have to wake up one roommate (the married couple's spouse) to get the snacks, which also wakes up the other roommate. The person says they get hangry and cry if they don't eat, and the roommates aren't working so they can sleep in. The edit clarifies that the author is a newborn, and the roommates are their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, so they can't really be expected to get a snack themselves. Newborns can't go to sleep when they're hungry at night; they need to be fed. The parents are the ones responsible for the baby's care. So waking them up for feedings is part of the normal parenting duties. The original question might have been confusing because it framed it as the author waking up others for a snack, but with the edit, it's clear that the author is a baby, so the situation is different. \n\nIn that case, the baby isn't doing anything wrong. Parents are expected to feed their infants as needed, which includes multiple times during the night. The parents might be the ones who are tired, but the baby's needs come first. The original answer without the edit might have been different, but with the clarification, the answer should be that the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B, No.\n"
