For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night around 3 AM for a snack. The author is a 6-week-old baby, so that's a key detail here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is very young and likely has no control over their eating schedule. Infants need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours, and their parents are expected to care for them regardless of the time. The roommates are the parents, so this is a family situation.\n\nThe original question mentions that the baby wakes up hungry and needs a snack. In a typical scenario, parents would attend to their baby's needs, even at night. The baby isn't choosing to wake up; it's a natural part of their development. The fact that they're in a temporary living arrangement with the parents might complicate things, but the parents are there to care for the baby regardless.\n\nThe user initially thought the author (the baby) is in the wrong, but that's from the baby's perspective. However, since the baby is an infant, they can't be at fault because they don't have the capacity to make choices. The situation is a result of the baby's biological needs, not intentional behavior.\n\nThe parents might have concerns about sleep or other factors, but the primary responsibility of parents is to meet their child's needs, even if it disrupts their rest. So the answer here should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the baby is doing what's necessary for survival and health, and parents are expected to handle such situations.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up the roles. The original question is from the baby's point of view, but since the baby isn't a decision-maker, the AITA question might actually be more about the parents' perspective. However, the way the question is framed, the \"author\" is the baby, so the answer must consider the baby's inability to be in the wrong here. The parents might be the ones who need to adjust, not the baby.\n"
