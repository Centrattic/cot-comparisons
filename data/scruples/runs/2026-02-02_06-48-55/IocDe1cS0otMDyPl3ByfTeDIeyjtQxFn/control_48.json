For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault for waking up their roommates every night for a snack. The context provided has some key details.\n\nFirst, the author is a newborn, which is crucial. The roommates are the author's parents, and they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The parents aren't working, so their sleep schedule isn't affected by early morning obligations. The author needs to eat at 2-3 AM because waiting until morning would make them hangry and upset. The parents have the snacks, and the author can't access them without waking them up.\n\nConsidering typical norms, waking up others for snacks might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author is a baby, so their needs are different. Infants can't wait for scheduled feedings if they need to eat. The parents, being caregivers, are expected to attend to the baby's needs regardless of the time. The situation is temporary, which also lessens the long-term impact. Since the parents aren't working, their sleep disruption isn't causing them to miss work or other responsibilities. Therefore, the baby isn't at fault here because their needs are essential and unavoidable. The answer should be B.\n"
