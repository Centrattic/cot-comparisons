For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a baby waking up parents for a snack at 3 AM. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. So the original question is from the baby's perspective, but the edit clarifies the baby is the one involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is a newborn, so waking up multiple times at night for feeding is typical and necessary. Newborns don't have a developed sleep cycle yet and need to eat frequently. The parents aren't working, so they can adjust their schedule. The baby can't help being hungry and needing to eat. Since it's a newborn, it's not the baby's fault. The parents should understand that this is part of caring for an infant. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the baby isn't responsible for their actions and it's a normal part of being a new parent.\n"
