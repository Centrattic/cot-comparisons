For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM to get a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room because of some unspecified reasons. The author is a 6-week-old baby, so that's a key detail.\n\nFirst, the baby's needs. Newborns have very different schedules and needs compared to adults. They need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours. So, waking up parents for feeding is normal and expected. The parents, being the caregivers, are responsible for the baby's care, which includes feeding. The baby isn't doing this on purpose; they can't control their sleep-wake cycles yet. \n\nThe parents aren't working, so they're not missing out on early morning activities. The baby is in a new environment, and the situation is temporary. The baby's health and well-being are the priority here. Parents understand that their newborn's needs come first, even if it disrupts their sleep. \n\nThe original question is phrased as an AITA scenario, but since the author is a baby, the responsibility isn't on them. Parents sign up for this when having a child. The situation is temporary, so there's no long-term issue expected. \n\nThe key here is the age of the author. Being a newborn, they can't be held responsible for their actions. The parents are aware of this and are managing it as part of parenting. There's no wrongdoing on the baby's part because it's a natural part of infancy. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
