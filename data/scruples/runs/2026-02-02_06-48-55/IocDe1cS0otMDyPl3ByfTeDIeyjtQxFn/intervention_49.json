For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the parents have all the snacks, so the author (a 6-week-old baby) has to wake them up to get food. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the person involved. The edit says the author is a newborn/baby, which changes things a lot. As a baby, they can't control their hunger or their need to eat at night. Infants typically wake up multiple times for feeding, so this isn't something they can help. The roommates are the parents, so they're responsible for the baby's care. \n\nIn the original question, the user thought the author might be in the wrong, but considering the baby aspect, the answer should be different. The parents are there to take care of the baby's needs, which include feeding at night. It's part of having a newborn. So, the baby isn't in the wrong because they can't help it, and the parents are expected to respond. \n\nThe question mentions Massachusetts, but I don't think the state law matters here because it's about social responsibility and family dynamics. The age edit is crucial. Without that, if it was an adult waking up roommates every night, it would be different. But since it's a baby, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
