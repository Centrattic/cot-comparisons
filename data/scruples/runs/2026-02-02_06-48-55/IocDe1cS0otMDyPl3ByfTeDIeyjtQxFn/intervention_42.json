For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that the author, who is a newborn, is sharing a room with their parents (the married couple). The parents have all the snacks, and the author can't access them without waking them up. The author says they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat then, and since the parents aren't working, they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, which is a key detail. Newborns have different needs compared to adults. They require frequent feeding, especially in the early weeks. However, the question mentions that this is happening every night around 3 AM. For a newborn, this could be part of their normal feeding schedule, but it's important to check if that's typical. Newborns usually do need to eat every 2-3 hours, so 3 AM might be within that range. But the problem is that the parents are being woken up each time, even though they can sleep in later.\n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective: they are not working, so maybe they can adjust their sleep schedule. However, being woken up multiple times a night could still be disruptive. But since the author is a baby, the parents might have expected this when taking care of an infant. It's part of parenting to adjust to the baby's needs, even if it's inconvenient.\n\nThe question is about whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong. Since the baby can't be held responsible in the traditional sense, but the question seems to be framed as if the baby is the one making a choice, which isn't accurate. However, the parents might be asking if they're in the wrong for allowing or continuing this. But the edit clarifies that the author is the baby, and the roommates are the parents. So the real point here is whether the baby's need for frequent feeding at night is unreasonable given the parents' situation.\n\nIn most cases, newborn care requires parents to accommodate the baby's needs, even if it means disrupted sleep. It's a temporary phase, and parents typically adjust. Therefore, the baby isn't in the wrong because they can't control their feeding schedule. However, the parents might need to find solutions, like establishing a routine or ensuring the baby isn't waking unnecessarily. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing, which is the baby here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the baby's needs are legitimate and beyond their control.\n"
