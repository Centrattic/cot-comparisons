For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily living in one room, the author is a newborn, and the roommates (their parents) aren't working. The author gets very hungry and cranky if they don't eat at 3 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, which is a baby. Their parents are the roommates. The parents aren't working, so their schedule is flexible. The baby needs to eat, which is a basic necessity. Waking the parents up is part of caring for the baby. But the question is framed as if the baby is an adult, which is confusing. Maybe there's a translation error or a mistake in the edit. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. That changes things. If the baby is a newborn, then the parents are responsible for feeding them. Waking up for feedings is normal. However, the original question is from the baby's perspective, which is odd. But in reality, the parents would be the ones taking care of the baby. So maybe the situation is presented incorrectly. The original poster might be misunderstanding their role. If the parents are the ones waking up to feed the baby, that's their responsibility. But the question seems to be from the baby's perspective, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the parents are the ones waking up because the baby is crying for food, but the parents aren't providing it. But the edit clarifies the author is the baby. So the real question here is whether a newborn is in the wrong for needing to eat and waking up their parents. But that's not how this works. The parents are supposed to care for the baby. So the author is a baby, so they can't be in the wrong. But the original post is written as if an adult is asking about waking up roommates. There's a contradiction here. The edit changes the scenario completely. If the author is a baby, then the parents are responsible, and the baby isn't at fault. So in that case, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, if the original scenario is taken as is (without the edit), where someone is a roommate waking up others for snacks, then maybe A. But the edit is part of the scenario, so the correct analysis is that the author is a baby. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
