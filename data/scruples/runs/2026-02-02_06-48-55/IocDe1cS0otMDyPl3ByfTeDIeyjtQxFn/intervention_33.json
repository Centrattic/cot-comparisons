For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for waking their roommates up every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation says they live in a two-bedroom apartment with two roommates, a married couple. They're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The person usually eats a late-night snack around 10 PM but wakes up really hungry at 2 or 3 AM. The problem is that one of the roommates (probably the mother, since they mention it's a married couple and the edit says the parents) has all the snacks, and they have to wake her up. Since everyone is in the same room, the other roommate (the father) gets woken up too.\n\nThe person argues that if they don't eat at 3 AM, they'll be hangry and cry until morning. Also, the roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The edit adds that the person is a 6-week-old newborn, and the roommates are their parents. So the original question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, so they can't really be at fault in the traditional sense. But the question is phrased as if the author is a person making a choice. However, a newborn doesn't have the capacity to make choices, so maybe the real issue is with the parents. But the question is about the author's responsibility.\n\nIn the original post, the author (the baby) can't be blamed for needing to eat, as that's a biological necessity. Newborns feed frequently, especially every few hours. But the way the question is framed, it's presented as if the author is making a conscious decision to wake up the parents for a snack. That's a bit confusing because a baby doesn't choose to wake up to eat. So maybe the real issue here is the parents' responsibility to provide care for their infant, which includes feeding them when they're hungry, even if it means being woken up.\n\nBut the question is asking if the author (the baby) is in the wrong. If we take the original scenario without the edit, the person is asking about waking up roommates for a snack. But with the edit, it's clear that this is a baby being fed by the parents. So there's a bit of a mistake in the premise. However, assuming the person is an adult (since they're using the term \"AITA\" \u2013 Am I the Asshole \u2013 which is typically used by adults on forums), but the edit reveals they're a newborn. This could be a joke or a mistake.\n\nIf we take the edit into account, the answer is straightforward. The baby is not at fault for needing to eat. Parents are expected to care for their infants, including feeding them during the night. So in that case, the baby is not in the wrong. But if we ignore the edit and consider the original scenario where the author is an adult, then the answer might be different. An adult waking up their roommates every night for snacks could be considered inconsiderate, especially if the roommates are disturbed. However, the author mentions that they can't help being hungry and that the roommates aren't working. In that case, maybe it's a bit of a grey area. But given the edit clarifies it's a baby, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong) because the baby has no control over their hunger and the parents should be feeding them as part of childcare.\n"
