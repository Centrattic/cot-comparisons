For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a 3 AM snack. The original post mentions that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents. Wait, that's a key detail I might have missed initially. So the situation is actually about a newborn baby needing a snack (probably a feeding, since they're a baby) in the middle of the night.\n\nFirst, the user thought the author was in the wrong, but after the edit, it's clear the author is a baby. So the initial context is different once you know they're an infant. The parents are the ones who are supposed to care for the baby, which includes feeding them. If the baby is waking up hungry, the parents are expected to provide the feeding. The original question framed it as the author (a baby) waking up the roommates, but the roommates are their parents, who aren't working and can sleep in. \n\nBut wait, the problem here is a bit of a misunderstanding. The baby is the one who's hungry and needs to be fed, which naturally wakes them up. The parents are the ones who should be feeding the baby, so it's not the baby's fault. The original post might have been a bit confusing because it's from the baby's perspective. The real issue is whether the baby is in the wrong for needing to be fed at night, which is a normal part of infant care. \n\nIn most cases, parents are used to getting up at night to feed their babies. The baby's need for frequent feedings is typical, especially in the first few months. The parents might be tired, but it's their responsibility as caregivers. The user initially thought the author (a person) was in the wrong, but once you know it's a baby, the perspective changes. So the answer would be B (No), because the baby isn't in the wrong for needing to eat at night. The parents should be handling the feedings, and the baby's natural needs shouldn't be blamed.\n"
