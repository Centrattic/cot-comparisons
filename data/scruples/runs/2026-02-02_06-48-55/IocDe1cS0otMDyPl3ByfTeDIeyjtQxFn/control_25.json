For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves waking up roommates for a snack at 3 AM. The user provided an edit that says the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents. That changes things a lot.\n\nFirst, the original question is from the perspective of someone living with roommates, but the edit clarifies it's an infant. Babies can't control their hunger or sleep schedules. They need to eat when they're hungry, regardless of the time. The parents aren't working, so they're probably used to being up at night with a newborn. Waking them up to feed the baby is a normal part of parenting, especially in the early weeks when babies need frequent feedings. The parents would be the ones caring for the baby, so it's their responsibility. The baby isn't at fault here. The answer should be B, No, because the author is a baby and can't be blamed for needing to eat.\n"
