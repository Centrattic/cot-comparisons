For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, who is a newborn baby, wakes up their parents at 3 AM for a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby is hungry and gets cranky if they don't eat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The key points here are the age of the author, which is a critical factor. A newborn has no control over their eating schedule and needs to eat frequently, especially during the night. The parents, as roommates, are sharing a space temporarily. The baby's hunger is a basic survival need, and waking up for feedings is normal for infants. \n\nThe parents not working means they can adjust their sleep schedules. The baby can't help being hungry and needing to eat at 3 AM. Since the baby is a newborn, it's expected that they'll need to feed multiple times a night. The parents, being asleep, might be bothered by the baby's crying, but it's part of having an infant. The parents might have to deal with this as part of caring for a newborn. \n\nThe situation is more about the natural needs of an infant rather than a choice. The author isn't a responsible party here because they're a baby. The parents should be understanding and adjust accordingly. There's no malicious intent; the baby just needs to eat. Therefore, the baby isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
