For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a newborn and their parents are roommates. The parents are sharing a room with the baby, and the baby wakes up hungry around 2 or 3 AM. The baby needs a snack, but the parents have all the snacks. So the baby has to wake them up to get food. The question is whether the baby is in the wrong for doing this every night.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the ages and relationships. The author is a newborn, so they can't be held responsible for their actions. The parents are adults and the ones in charge of caring for the baby. The baby needing to eat at night is natural and expected. Newborns typically wake up multiple times for feedings. Since the parents are not working, they can adjust their schedules to accommodate the baby's needs.\n\nThe original situation mentions that if the baby doesn't eat, they get hangry and cry. That's a normal reaction for a hungry baby. The parents are supposed to respond to the baby's needs, including feeding them. Even if it means waking up, it's part of parenting. The edit clarifies that the roommates are the parents, so the dynamics are different from roommates without a parent-child relationship.\n\nSo, considering the baby's age and the parents' responsibility to care for them, the baby isn't in the wrong. The parents should expect that a newborn's needs, like feeding, require them to wake up. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
