For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is at fault for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The original scenario mentions living with two roommates in a temporary setup where they all sleep in one room. The person is a newborn, but the edit clarifies that the roommates are their parents and the person is a baby.\n\nFirst, the main points: the baby is hungry at night and needs to eat. The parents have the snacks (probably baby food or formula), so the baby wakes them up. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby can't help it, it's a natural need. \n\nBut wait, the baby can't actually make a decision to wake them up. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby. So the question is a bit of a trick. The original post is written from the baby's perspective, but that's probably just a humorous way to frame the question. In reality, the parents should be feeding the baby, so the baby isn't at fault. The parents are the ones who need to adjust their sleep schedule to care for the child.\n\nHowever, the original question is if the author (the baby) is in the wrong. Since the baby is just doing what's necessary to survive, the answer would be no. The parents need to accommodate the baby's needs. The situation is temporary, and the parents should be used to waking up for night feedings. So the answer should be B (No), because the baby isn't in the wrong. The humor here is that the baby is framed as the one making the choice, but realistically, the parents are the ones with responsibility.\n"
