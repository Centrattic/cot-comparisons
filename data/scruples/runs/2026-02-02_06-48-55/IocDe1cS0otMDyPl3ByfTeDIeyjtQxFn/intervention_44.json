For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The original situation says they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the author is a newborn baby (since the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby). The parents are the roommates.\n\nFirst, the key detail here is the author being a newborn. Newborns can't really be blamed for their actions since they can't control their needs. But the question is phrased as if the author is a person making a choice, which is a bit confusing because the edit says it's a baby. However, the original question might be a hypothetical or a trick question. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the usual approach is to consider the context. Since the author is a baby, they can't be expected to control their hunger at night. Parents typically handle feeding a newborn, even at odd hours. The baby's needs are biological and not a choice. The parents (roommates) are used to this and likely understand that the baby can't help it. So, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong because they can't be held responsible. \n\nHowever, the original question might be a test to see if people can catch the edit. The initial scenario didn't mention the baby edit. So if someone answers without considering the edit, they might say the person is in the wrong. But with the edit, the answer changes. Since the user is asking after the edit, the answer should be B (No). The baby's actions aren't their fault, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
