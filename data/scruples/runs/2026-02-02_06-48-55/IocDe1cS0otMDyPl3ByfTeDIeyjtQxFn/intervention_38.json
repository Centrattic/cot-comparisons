For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM to get a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in one room, and the author, as a newborn, needs a snack that the parents have control over. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so they can't really be expected to manage without food at those hours. But wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. That changes things completely. The original question was written from the perspective of someone who's a baby, not an adult. The parents are the roommates mentioned. So the real question is whether a baby waking up parents for a snack at 2-3 AM is wrong.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased makes it a bit confusing. The original setup says the author is a person living with roommates, but the edit clarifies they're a baby. So the parents are the ones who have the snacks and the baby needs to wake them up. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the baby's actions aren't judged the same way as adults. Since the baby is very young, it's natural for them to need frequent feedings. However, the question is framed as if the baby is choosing to wake up the parents, which isn't the case. Babies can't control their sleep cycles yet, so they wake up hungry regardless. \n\nBut the parents are the ones who have the snacks, so maybe the issue is about the parents not having the snacks accessible for the baby. If they're all in the same room, the parents might be expected to have the baby's feeding supplies nearby. Alternatively, maybe the parents are being strict about giving food only when they're awake. \n\nHowever, considering the baby's needs, it's essential for their health and development to be fed when hungry. If the baby isn't getting enough food during the day, leading to extreme hunger at night, that's a problem that needs to be addressed. But the baby isn't making a conscious choice here. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the parents are being unreasonable. If the baby is waking up naturally and needs to eat, it's not the baby's fault. The parents should adjust to the baby's needs. However, the way the original question is framed makes it seem like the author (baby) is making a choice, which isn't accurate. \n\nBut since the question asks if the author is at fault, and the author is a baby, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), because the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. The real issue is the parents' responsibility to care for the baby's needs. However, the original scenario is a bit confusing because it's a baby in an apartment with parents, not typical roommates. The parents are the caregivers, so expecting them to feed the baby at night is normal. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because as a newborn, they have no control over their hunger and need to be fed by their parents regardless of the time.\n"
