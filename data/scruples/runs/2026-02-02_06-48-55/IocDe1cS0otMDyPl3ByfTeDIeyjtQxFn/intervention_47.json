For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 2-3 AM to get a snack. The main points here are that the author is a newborn, all three are temporarily sleeping in one room, the author is hungry and gets hangry if they wait, and the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author's parents have all the snacks, and the author can't access them without waking them up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so their needs are basic and immediate. They can't control their hunger or sleep schedule yet. The parents are also in the same room, so it's a shared space. The parents aren't working, so they might have more flexibility. The situation is temporary, which is mentioned as a reason for the setup.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're not considering that a newborn can't help their habits. The parents chose to have this arrangement, so they might have expected this. However, waking someone up multiple times a night could affect their rest, even if they aren't working. But since the author is a baby, it's a natural need. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a newborn, the author can't be held responsible. The parents might need to adjust the situation, perhaps by having more accessible snacks for the baby. The fact that they're all in the same room complicates things, but it's a temporary situation. The parents might need to find a way to manage the baby's needs without being disturbed too much, but the baby isn't at fault here. \n\nSo the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the baby can't be expected to control their hunger and the situation is temporary. The parents should adjust to the baby's needs since they've chosen the current setup.\n"
