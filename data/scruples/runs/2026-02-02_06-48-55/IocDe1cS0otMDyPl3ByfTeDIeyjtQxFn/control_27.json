For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM to get a snack. The situation is that all three are sharing one room temporarily, and the roommates (the couple) have all the snacks. The author can't access them without waking them up. The author gets very hungry if they don't eat at that time and ends up hangry and crying. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Oh, that's a big detail! So, the original question was written from the perspective of an adult, but the edit clarifies it's a newborn. So, the real person in question is an infant, and the parents are the ones being woken up. \n\nSo the original question is a bit confusing because it's written as if the author is an adult, but it's actually a baby. The parents are the roommates, but they're already the baby's caregivers. The parents aren't working, so they can adjust their sleep schedule. For a newborn, feeding at night is standard. Babies need to eat frequently for proper growth and development. Waking up multiple times a night is normal for infants. \n\nThe parents might be tired, but that's part of having a newborn. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby, which includes feeding them. The baby can't help it that it's hungry at 3 AM. So in this context, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The question's premise is a bit of a humorous twist since it's a baby, not an adult. The parents can't really hold the baby accountable for needing to eat. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. It's a typical situation for a newborn, and the parents need to adjust to the baby's needs.\n"
