For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a newborn baby waking up parents at 3 AM for snacks, which in turn wakes the other parent too. The baby can't access food on their own, so they need to ask the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby gets hangry and cries if they don't eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, which is a baby. So it's not a typical roommate situation. The parents are the roommates here. The question is whether waking up the parents for a snack is wrong. \n\nIn a normal adult scenario, waking people up for snacks might be considered rude, especially if it's every night. However, this is a baby. Newborns have different needs. They can't make their own food, and their hunger can't be ignored. The baby can't help waking the parents up; it's a biological need. The parents, being the caregivers, are supposed to take care of the baby's needs, including feeding them. So in this context, the baby isn't in the wrong. The situation is part of parenting responsibilities. The parents might be adjusting to the demands, but the baby's actions are not morally wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
