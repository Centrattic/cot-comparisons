For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a snack at 3 AM. The author is a newborn, so I need to consider that context.\n\nFirst, the situation: All three are sleeping in one room because of temporary circumstances. The author is a baby who needs to eat at night, but the parents have all the snacks and the author can't access them without waking them up. The author says they get hangry and cry if they don't eat, but the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The state is Massachusetts, but I don't know if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, the author is a baby. So maybe the issue is different than if they were an adult. A newborn's needs are different. They can't help but wake up hungry and need to be fed. The parents are the ones responsible for the baby's care. So waking them up for feedings is part of parenting. But the parents might be frustrated if they're not getting enough sleep. However, the baby is only six weeks old, which is a critical time for feeding and bonding. It's normal for newborns to need frequent feedings.\n\nSo the original question is if the author is in the wrong. But since the author is a baby, the concept of right or wrong probably doesn't apply. The parents are the ones who have to manage the situation. The question might be more about whether the parents should be upset, but the user is asking about the author's responsibility. Since the baby can't help it, the answer would be that the baby isn't in the wrong. The parents might need to adjust to the baby's needs, which is part of having a newborn. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
