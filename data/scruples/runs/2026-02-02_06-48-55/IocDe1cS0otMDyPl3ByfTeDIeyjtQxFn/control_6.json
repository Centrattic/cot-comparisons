For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation involves the author, their parents who are roommates, and all three are temporarily sharing one bedroom. The author is a newborn, which adds context.\n\nFirst, the author is a newborn, so they can't really be held responsible for their actions. Newborns don't have the capacity to plan or understand social norms. They have basic needs like eating, and they can't help waking others if they need to be fed. The parents are also not working, so their schedules are flexible. The main issue here is the living arrangement and the author's biological needs.\n\nThe parents might be stressed if the baby is waking them up every night. However, caring for a newborn is a common challenge, and it's expected that parents would manage their rest accordingly. The fact that the author is a baby makes the situation different from an adult making choices. There's no malice here; it's about survival and health.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't at fault because they're an infant. The parents, as caregivers, are responsible for the baby's needs. The question of being \"in the wrong\" doesn't apply to a newborn. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
