For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily living in one room because of some circumstances. The author is a newborn, which is a key detail.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author. A newborn baby can't be expected to control their eating schedule. Parents usually accommodate a baby's needs, even at odd hours. However, the question is phrased as if the author is an adult, which seems conflicting because a newborn can't be a roommate. But the edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are the parents. That's an unusual setup. Maybe the parents are staying with someone else, but the edit says they're the parents. Wait, maybe the parents are the roommates, and the baby is the author? That's a bit confusing. \n\nAssuming the author is a baby, then the parents would naturally have to feed them at night, even if it disrupts their sleep. However, the parents aren't working, so they have flexible schedules. The baby is in the same room, so waking them up is unavoidable. The parents might be adjusting to having a newborn, but as parents, it's part of their responsibility. However, the question is framed as AITA (Am I the Asshole?), which suggests the author feels guilty about disturbing the parents. But given that the author is a newborn, it's not their fault. The parents are there to care for the baby's needs. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If the parents are not the primary caregivers and the baby is staying with them temporarily, perhaps there's a different dynamic. However, typically, parents would manage their sleep accordingly when caring for an infant. Since the parents are awake anyway, it's part of their role. The fact that the baby is hungry and needs to eat is a natural need. Therefore, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The parents might need to adjust their routines, but the baby can't control their hunger. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), because the baby isn't responsible for their actions and feeding is a necessity.\n"
