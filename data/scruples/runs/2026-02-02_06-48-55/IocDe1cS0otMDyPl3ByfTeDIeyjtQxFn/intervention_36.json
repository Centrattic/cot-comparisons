For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is a bit complex. The author is a newborn, living with their parents in a temporary arrangement where they're all sleeping in one room. The parents have all the snacks, and the author can't access them without waking them up. The author explains that if they don't eat at 3 AM, they get very cranky and even cry from hunger. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is a baby, which is a crucial detail. Newborns have different needs compared to adults. They require frequent feeding, especially in the early weeks. The parents are the roommates here, which adds another layer because it's a parent-child dynamic rather than just roommates. The temporary living situation might mean that the usual roommate rules don't apply directly. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is at fault. Since the author is a newborn, they don't have control over their feeding schedule. Parents of newborns know that babies wake up frequently for feedings, which is a natural part of their development. In this case, the author is waking up hungry and needing to eat, which isn't something a baby can help. The parents, being adults, can adjust their sleep to accommodate the baby's needs, especially since they aren't working.\n\nHowever, maybe the parents could have arranged the living situation differently to make it easier for the baby. For example, having a crib or a separate sleeping area that allows the baby to be fed without waking the parents. But since they're in a temporary setup, there might be limitations. The parents might also be managing their own needs, but the baby's needs are more critical here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault because they're an infant. The parents are responsible for the baby's care, so the situation is more about how the parents handle it rather than the baby's actions. The question is phrased as an AITA (Am I the Asshole?), but given the baby's age, it's not a case of the author being wrong. Instead, the focus should be on the parents' ability to manage the living situation to minimize disruptions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they're a newborn with natural feeding needs that can't be controlled. The parents need to adapt to the baby's schedule as part of their caregiving role.\n"
