For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates, who are their parents, for a 3 AM snack. The author is a newborn, so that's a key point.\n\nFirst, the situation is that they're all temporarily in one room. The author needs a snack around 2-3 AM but doesn't have easy access. They have to wake up one parent, who has the snacks, and usually both parents get woken up. The author mentions that without eating, they get really hungry and upset, even crying. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the author can't wait until morning.\n\nNow, considering the author is a baby, they probably can't help being hungry at night. Newborns need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours. So waking up the parents is part of having a newborn. The parents, as adults, should expect that having a baby means disrupted sleep for feeding. The author is 6 weeks old, so this is a temporary phase. The parents might be adjusting to having a baby in the house, which changes their routine.\n\nThe question of right or wrong here might depend on cultural norms or expectations. But given that it's a newborn, it's a natural part of parenting. The parents should have anticipated this when they decided to have a baby. Also, the baby can't control their hunger, so it's not their fault. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby, which includes feeding them even if it means getting up at night. \n\nSo, in this context, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
