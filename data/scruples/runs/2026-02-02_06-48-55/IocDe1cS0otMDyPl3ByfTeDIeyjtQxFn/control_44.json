For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for waking up their roommates for a snack. They live in an apartment with two roommates, a married couple, and all three are temporarily sleeping in one room. The person usually eats at 10 PM but gets hungry again at 2-3 AM and has to wake one of the roommates to get a snack. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The edit says the person is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents.\n\nHmm. So first, the user is an infant. The parents are the roommates. The baby is waking up hungry at night and needs to eat. The parents are supposed to feed the baby, right? But in this case, the baby is waking them up. Wait, but isn't it normal for a newborn to need feedings during the night? Newborns typically need to eat every few hours. So the parents are expected to feed the baby, even if it's at 2 or 3 AM. So the baby isn't at fault here. The parents are the caregivers, so it's their responsibility. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The parents are supposed to take care of the baby's needs, even if it means waking up. The original question is phrased as AITA, but in reality, the parents are the ones who should be accommodating the baby's needs. The user's situation is a normal part of having a newborn.\n"
