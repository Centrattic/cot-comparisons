For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation involves the author living with their parents in a temporary setup where they all sleep in one room. The author is a newborn, so they can't really be expected to ask for a snack themselves. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author wakes them up to get fed, otherwise they get cranky and cry.\n\nFirst, the edit is crucial here. The author is a baby, which changes everything. If they're a newborn, they can't help waking the parents up when they're hungry. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby, so it's part of parenting. The original question might have been tricky without that edit, but once you know the author is a baby, the answer becomes clear. Newborns need to eat frequently, and parents expect that. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong. But wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but that's before considering the edit. The key here is the edit that says the author is a baby. So the answer should be B because the baby can't help it, and the parents are there to take care of them. The parents not working also means they can sleep in, but the baby's needs take priority. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
