For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in the same room because of some unspecified reasons. The author mentions being a 6-week-old baby, which is a key detail I almost missed.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the edit properly. The author clarifies that they are a newborn, so the original post might have been a bit confusing. Wait, how can a baby be eating snacks? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the original post was a hypothetical or a mistake. But the edit says they're a baby, so the scenario is that a newborn is waking up hungry at 3 AM. But babies typically feed on demand, so parents usually accommodate that. However, here the parents are the roommates, and they're not working, so they can sleep in. \n\nThe author is asking if it's their fault (AITA) to wake them up for a snack. But as a baby, they can't ask for a snack; they cry. But the post is written from the perspective of the baby, which is odd. Maybe it's a humorous take or an error. The parents are the ones who should be caring for the baby's needs, including feeding. If the baby is hungry and needs to be fed, the parents are the ones who should respond. However, the original question frames the author as the one doing the waking up. \n\nWait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby, so the scenario must be that the baby is waking up hungry and needs to be fed. But the parents (roommates) are the ones who should be feeding the baby. If the baby's feeding is causing the parents to be disturbed, maybe the parents should adjust their schedules. Since the parents aren't working, they can adjust their sleep. But the original question is from the baby's perspective, which is a bit confusing. \n\nIn reality, a baby can't ask for a snack; they cry, and the parents are responsible. So the parents are the ones who should be responsive. However, the question is phrased as the author being in the wrong for waking them up. But if the author is a baby, they're not at fault. The parents might be struggling with sleep, but the baby's needs are essential. \n\nSo the answer hinges on the edit. Since the author is a newborn, they can't be in the wrong for needing to be fed. The parents (roommates) are expected to care for the baby's needs even if it interrupts their sleep. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they're a baby. However, the initial question's framing is a bit off, but considering the edit, B is the correct choice.\n"
