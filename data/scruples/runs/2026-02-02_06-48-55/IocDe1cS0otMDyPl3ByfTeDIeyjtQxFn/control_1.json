For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the author, who is a newborn, needs a snack but can't access it without waking up their parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby needs to eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so they can't help it that they need to eat at night. The snack here is probably a feeding session. Newborns typically wake up frequently for feedings, which can be every few hours. Since the parents are the ones with the food (in this case, the baby's food), the baby has no choice but to wake them up to eat.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong. Since the baby is an infant, they don't have control over their feeding schedule. Parents of newborns often adjust their schedules to accommodate the baby's needs. The parents aren't working, so they can adjust their sleep accordingly. The baby's needs are essential for survival and health, so waking the parents is necessary.\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole?) angle here is tricky because it's a newborn. The baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. The parents might be the ones adjusting to the baby's needs, which is a common part of parenting. The answer would likely be that the baby isn't in the wrong because it's a normal part of having a newborn. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
