For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The original scenario says they live in an apartment with two roommates (a married couple) and they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The person gets hungry at 2-3 AM and has to wake one roommate (who has the snacks) to get something to eat. They usually end up waking both roommates. The user mentions that if they don't get a snack, they become hangry and cry. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are actually their parents.\n\nSo, first, the key points here are: the author is a newborn, the roommates are parents, and the situation is about waking them up for a snack. Now, considering that the author is a baby, the question is whether this is the baby's fault. Since a 6-week-old can't be held responsible for their actions, the answer should be B (No). However, the original question is phrased as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), but since the author is a baby, they can't be in the wrong. The parents might have their own issues, but the baby isn't at fault here. The humor in the edit probably points out the absurdity of the original question. So the answer is B.\n"
