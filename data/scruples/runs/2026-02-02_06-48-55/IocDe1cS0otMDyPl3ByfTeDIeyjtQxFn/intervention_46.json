For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their parents in a temporary setup where all three are in one room. The person wakes up hungry around 2-3 AM and needs to get a snack from their parent, which wakes both parents up. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author is a newborn? Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Oh, that's a big detail. Wait, the original post says \"I think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\" But the edit clarifies that the author is a baby. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the original post is written from the perspective of someone who is a baby, but that's not possible. Wait, the user is asking about the scenario where the author is a newborn, and the parents are the roommates. So the original question is phrased as if the person is an adult, but the edit clarifies that they're a baby.\n\nSo maybe the user is testing if I can catch that discrepancy. But the user's actual question is whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong. But a baby can't be in the wrong, obviously. However, the original question is presented as if the author is an adult, but the edit changes that. So the user might be confused here.\n\nBut according to the user's edit, the author is a 6-week-old newborn, and the parents are the roommates. So the situation is that a baby is waking up hungry at night and needs to eat, which wakes up the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The parents are the roommates, but they're the baby's parents. The question is whether the baby is in the wrong for waking them up for a snack every night.\n\nBut obviously, a baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby. So in that case, the answer would be B (No). However, the original post was written from an adult perspective, but the edit changes the scenario. The user might have made a mistake in the edit, but the key point is that the author is a baby. So the answer should be B, because the baby isn't at fault. The parents are responsible for feeding them, even if it disrupts their sleep. Since the parents aren't working, they can adjust their schedule. Therefore, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong.\n"
