For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are actually their parents) for a 3 AM snack. The key points here are the context of the living situation and the ages of the individuals involved.\n\nFirst, the original question mentions that the author is a \"6 week old newborn/baby.\" That's a crucial detail. A newborn can't really be eating snacks or waking people up on their own. This seems like a joke or a twist, but the parents are the ones who would be taking care of the baby's needs, including feeding. The baby's hunger would naturally wake the parents, especially in the middle of the night. So, the scenario is a bit of a role reversal where the baby is the one needing something, but the setup is presented as the author (baby) waking up the parents for a snack.\n\nIn a typical situation, if someone were an adult waking up their roommates every night for a snack, it might be considered inconsiderate. But here, the roles are flipped. The parents are the roommates, and the baby is the one with the legitimate need. Parents generally expect to be woken up for their baby's needs, like feeding or comfort, especially in the early months when babies require frequent attention. The situation is different because it's a newborn's necessity, not an adult's habit of late-night snacking.\n\nAlso, the parents aren't working, so their schedule is flexible. They already have to deal with nighttime feedings, which are standard for newborn care. The baby's hunger leading to being hangry and emotional is natural but part of the parents' responsibility in caring for an infant. \n\nGiven the edit clarifying the baby's age and the parents' role, the original scenario is a humorous take on the typical AITA situation. The author isn't in the wrong because the needs of a newborn are critical and expected to disrupt the parents' sleep. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
