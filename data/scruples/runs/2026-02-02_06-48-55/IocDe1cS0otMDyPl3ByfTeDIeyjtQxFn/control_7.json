For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment, but they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is a newborn, so maybe that's a typo? Wait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" Oh, that's important. So the author is a baby, and the roommates are the parents. \n\nThe baby wakes up around 2 or 3 AM hungry and needs a snack. The parents have all the snacks, so the baby has to wake them up to get a snack. The baby says if they don't eat then, they get really cranky and cry because of hunger. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The question is whether the baby is at fault for waking the parents up every night.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age of the author. If it's a 6-week-old baby, they can't really be blamed for waking up hungry. Babies typically need to eat frequently, every few hours, especially in the early months. So the baby's actions are natural and necessary for their well-being. The parents, as caregivers, are expected to attend to the baby's needs, including feeding them during the night. \n\nThe parents aren't working, so their sleep might not be as crucial as if they had to get up early for work. The baby's health and comfort are important. Waking up hungry and crying is a survival mechanism for babies to signal their needs. It's not something they can control consciously. \n\nThe situation mentions that all three are temporarily in one room, which probably isn't ideal for sleep. But given that it's a temporary arrangement and the baby's needs, the parents should be understanding. The parents are responsible for the baby's care, so waking up to feed them isn't unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the baby can't be at fault here. The parents should manage the situation by either bringing snacks to the baby's room or adjusting their own sleep schedule to accommodate the baby's needs. The baby doesn't have the capacity to be in the wrong for needing to eat. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they're a baby with natural needs that the parents are responsible for addressing.\n"
