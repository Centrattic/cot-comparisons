For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are actually their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The author mentioned they're a 6-week-old baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The family is temporarily all sleeping in one room. The author is a newborn, so they need to eat, but the snacks are with one of the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author wakes them up to get a snack, which also wakes the other parent.\n\nNow, considering the context. A newborn's needs are typically the priority because they can't feed themselves. However, the parents are the ones providing care. Normally, a baby would be fed without issue, but here, the snacks (which are presumably baby food or formula) are stored with one parent. The author is waking them up to get it. But since the parents are not working, their sleeping in isn't as essential. However, being a parent, they might have their own sleep needs. \n\nBut wait, the author is a baby, so they don't have control over when they need to eat. Hunger at 3 AM is normal for a newborn. The problem is that the author is waking the parents up every night. If the parents have to get up anyway to feed the baby, that's standard. But if they're being woken up specifically because the snacks are stored in a way that requires them to give it, maybe there's a setup issue. The parents could adjust where the snacks are kept so the author can access them without waking them. But the author is a baby, so they can't do that\u2014someone else would have to arrange it. \n\nHowever, the edit clarifies that the parents are the roommates. So the author is a baby, and the parents are the ones in the same room. The baby can't realistically be blamed for needing to eat. The parents are responsible for feeding the baby. If the baby is waking up hungry, that might be a sign that the feeding schedule needs adjustment, or the snacks (formula, etc.) need to be more accessible. The parents might need to take steps to provide the baby with what they need without being woken up, but given that it's a baby, it's part of parenting. \n\nThe question is whether the baby is at fault. Since the baby is a newborn and can't control their hunger, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The responsibility lies with the parents to manage the baby's needs without being unnecessarily disturbed. The parents might need to adjust their setup, but the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat.\n"
