For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation involves the author, their parents (the married couple), and they're all temporarily sharing one room because of some circumstances. The author is a newborn, which is a key detail I almost missed in the edit.\n\nFirst, considering the age of the author: a 6-week-old baby can't really be making decisions about waking people up for snacks. That seems like a red herring or a typo. Maybe they meant they're a new parent? But the original question says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the author is a baby. That changes everything. A baby can't be responsible for their actions, so the question of being in the wrong doesn't apply. But the scenario is written from the baby's perspective, which is unusual. Maybe it's a humorous or satirical post. \n\nThe parents are not working, so they can sleep in. The baby is hungry and needs to eat, but since the parents have all the snacks, the baby has to wake them up. However, a baby typically feeds on demand, so waking up parents multiple times at night is normal. But the parents might have different expectations once the baby is a few months old. However, at 6 weeks, it's still common for babies to need frequent feedings. \n\nThe real issue here is the setup: the parents have all the snacks, but the baby can't access them. If the baby is human, they can't access snacks independently. The parents should ensure the baby is fed, so maybe they need to adjust their own habits to make feeding easier. If the parents are the ones storing snacks in a way that's inaccessible, perhaps they should reconsider. But since the baby is a minor, the responsibility isn't on them. \n\nBut the way the question is phrased makes it seem like a human adult is the one waking others up for snacks, which is conflicting with the baby edit. The confusion here is whether the author is an adult or a baby. The original question says the author is a baby. In that case, the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, if the author is an adult posing as a baby, that's a different scenario. But according to the edit, the author is a newborn. Therefore, the answer is B because the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat. The parents should arrange things to make feeding easier without being disturbed.\n"
