For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a newborn living with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment where everyone is temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is waking up around 2 or 3 AM very hungry and needs to get a snack from their parent who has all the snacks. Because they're all in the same room, both parents get woken up. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author is asking if they're at fault for this.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the author, the living situation, and the necessity of the snack. The original post says the author is a \"6-week-old newborn/baby,\" which is a crucial detail. Newborns have very different needs compared to adults. They require frequent feeding, especially during the night. However, the initial question might be a bit confusing because a 6-week-old baby can't walk around the apartment or ask for snacks themselves. That part seems off. Wait, maybe the author is using \"newborn\" metaphorically? Because otherwise, a baby can't be writing an AITA post. Maybe there's a mistake here. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby and the roommates are their parents. So, the actual scenario is a baby needing to eat at night, which is normal. But the way the question is phrased is from the baby's perspective, which is a bit humorous because babies can't write. Maybe it's a hypothetical scenario where the author is comparing themselves to a newborn in terms of needing snacks every night.\n\nAssuming the author is using the newborn as a metaphor to emphasize extreme hunger, but in reality, the situation is a person who is an adult living with parents and waking them up for late-night snacks. The parents aren't working, so they have flexibility. The author's reasoning is that going hungry would make them hangry. However, waking up two people multiple times a night could be disruptive. On the other hand, the author's needs are valid if they're experiencing significant discomfort or health issues from hunger.\n\nBut considering the edit clarifies the author is a baby, then the answer is different. A baby needing to eat at night is typical and not the baby's fault. Parents are expected to care for their baby's needs, including feeding them during the night. In that case, the author (as a baby) isn't in the wrong. However, the original question's framing is a bit confusing because it's an adult perspective using a baby metaphor. If the actual scenario is a baby, then the answer is B (No). If it's an adult using the baby as a metaphor, then there's a balance between personal needs and consideration for others. But given the edit, the correct interpretation is the author is a baby, so the answer is B.\n"
