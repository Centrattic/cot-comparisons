For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The author is a newborn, so they're 6 weeks old. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby is hungry at night, which is normal. But since they're all in one room, the baby has to wake up the parents to get a snack. However, the parents are not working, so maybe they can adjust their schedule. But the baby is a newborn; they can't help it. They need to eat, especially if they're hungry and would get cranky otherwise. \n\nThe original question is from the baby's perspective, but since the baby is 6 weeks old, maybe the parents are handling the baby's needs. Wait, the edit clarifies that the author is the baby. So the real issue here is whether the baby is at fault for needing nighttime feedings. But the parents are responsible for caring for the baby. Newborns need frequent feedings, so it's not the baby's fault. However, the parents might be struggling with the lack of sleep. The question is phrased as the baby being in the wrong, which is a bit odd because babies can't be at fault. \n\nWait, the original AITA question is from the baby's POV? That's unusual. The answer would hinge on understanding that a newborn can't control their hunger and that parents are expected to care for them. So the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Because it's a normal part of caring for a newborn, and the parents should adjust for their baby's needs.\n"
