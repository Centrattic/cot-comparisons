For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is at fault for waking up their roommates every night for a snack. The situation is a bit specific. The roommates are actually their parents, since the user mentions being a \"6 week old newborn/baby.\" Wait, that part is confusing. Wait, the user says they are a newborn, so they're a baby. But how does a baby have roommates? Oh, maybe there's a typo. Maybe they meant that their roommate is a newborn, but the edit says the user is the newborn. Wait, that can't be. Wait, looking at the original post again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for waking up their roommates (a married couple) for a snack. Then in the edit, they clarify that the state is MA and they are a 6-week-old newborn. So the author is a baby. The married couple are their parents. Oh, okay, that makes sense. The initial post might have been confusing because the user is a baby, but the roommates are their parents. So the question is whether the baby is at fault for waking up their parents every night for a snack. \n\nWait, but a baby can't wake up their parents on purpose for a snack. So maybe there's a mistake here. Maybe the user is the parent of a newborn and the roommates are the parents' roommates? But the edit says the author is the newborn. Hmm. Let me recheck the original post. The original post says \"the person who wrote this\" and the situation is that the author is living with two roommates (a married couple) in a two-bedroom apartment. They are all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author eats a late-night snack around 10 PM, but wakes up hungry at 2-3 AM and has to wake one of the roommates (who has all the snacks) to get a snack. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The question is if the author is at fault. Then in the edit, the author clarifies that they are a 6-week-old newborn and the married couple are their parents. So the author is a baby. But a baby can't be waking up their parents on purpose for a snack. Unless the baby is hungry and needs to be fed, which is normal. But the parents are the ones who should be taking care of the baby's needs. \n\nSo the problem here is that the original post was likely written by the parent, asking if they're at fault for waking up their own roommates (maybe they have other roommates besides their parents?) but the edit clarifies that the author is a newborn, which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the edit. Let me read the original post again carefully. The user says they live in an apartment with two roommates (married couple). They are temporarily all sleeping in one room. They (the author) eat a late-night snack around 10 PM but wake up hungry at 2-3 AM and have to wake up one of the roommates (who has all the snacks) to get a snack. Then in the edit, they clarify that the author is a 6-week-old newborn and the married couple are their parents. \n\nSo the author is a baby, and the parents are the roommates. But a baby can't be the one making the request. The parents are the ones who would be feeding the baby. So the situation must be that the parents are sleep-deprived from taking care of the baby and are asking if they're at fault for waking up their own roommates (other parents or in-laws?) for a snack. But this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original poster is the parent of a newborn and is asking if they're at fault for waking up their roommates (the parents) for help or snacks. But the edit clarifies that the author is the newborn. There's a contradiction here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the edit. If the author is a newborn, then the question is about the parents' actions. But the original post is phrased as if the author is an adult. This might be a confusion in the question. \n\nAssuming the edit is correct and the author is a newborn, then the parents are the ones who are being woken up, but the question is whether the author (baby) is in the wrong. Obviously, a baby can't be in the wrong for needing to eat. But the original post is from an adult perspective. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the edit. Maybe they meant that the author is a new parent (new to parenting a baby) and the roommates are their own parents (the grandparents). So the new parent is waking up their parents every night to get a snack for the baby. But in the original scenario, the author has to wake up the roommates (parents) to get snacks for themselves. If the author is the parent, maybe they're asking if it's okay to wake up their own parents for help with the baby. But the original post mentions that the author is waking up the roommates to get a snack, not for the baby. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to parse it again. The key points: author is in a shared apartment with two roommates (married couple), all sleeping in one room temporarily. Author wakes up hungry at 2-3 AM, roommates have snacks, author has to wake them. Roommates aren't working, so can sleep in. Edit says author is a 6-week-old newborn, roommates are parents. \n\nSo the author is a baby, and the parents are the roommates. The baby is waking up hungry and needs a snack, so the parents have to feed the baby. But the baby can't help it. So the question is whether the baby is at fault for waking up the parents. Obviously not. But the original question is phrased as \"AITA for waking up my roommates for a snack?\" from the author's perspective. If the author is a baby, then they can't be at fault. But the original question is written from an adult's perspective. There's a contradiction here. \n\nPerhaps the user intended to say that they are a new parent (not a baby) and are asking if they're at fault for waking up their own parents (the roommates) for snacks. Maybe the edit was a mistake. If that's the case, then we have a parent waking up their own parents for snacks. But the original post says the author has to wake up the roommates because they have all the snacks. So maybe the parents (the roommates) have snacks, and the author (the parent) is waking them up for a snack. But that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, the author is a new parent of a newborn and is sleep-deprived, needing snacks at night but can't access them without waking up their own roommates (parents or others). But the edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the confusion, I need to make an assumption. The most plausible scenario is that the user is a new parent (not a baby) who's sleep-deprived and needs snacks but has to wake up their parents (roommates) for them. However, the edit says the author is a newborn. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant the author is a new parent. Alternatively, the author is a baby, and the parents are the ones getting up to feed the baby, but the parents are also roommates. \n\nAssuming the edit is correct and the author is a 6-week-old baby, then the baby is not at fault for needing to eat. The parents are the ones who are supposed to care for the baby's needs. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). \n\nIf the author is an adult, then we need to assess whether it's reasonable to wake up roommates every night for snacks. If the roommates aren't working and can sleep in, but it's still causing discomfort, then maybe the author is in the wrong. However, if the author is genuinely suffering (hangry, crying) and the roommates aren't working, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But given the edit clarifying the author is a baby, the answer is clearly B.\n"
