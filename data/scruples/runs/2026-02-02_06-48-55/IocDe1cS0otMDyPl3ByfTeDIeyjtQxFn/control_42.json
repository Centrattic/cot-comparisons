For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates, who are their parents, for a 3 AM snack. The author is a baby, so that's a key point. \n\nFirst, the situation: the baby is hungry at night, needs to eat, but the parents have all the snacks and there's no easy access. The baby wakes them up to get food. The parents aren't working, so maybe they can sleep in.\n\nBut wait, the baby is a newborn. Newborns have different needs. They eat frequently, and it's normal for them to wake up at night for feeding. However, the scenario mentions snacks, which might imply solid food, but a newborn typically only needs breast milk or formula. If the baby is 6 weeks old, they might not be on snacks yet. Maybe there's a mix-up here. The edit clarifies the baby is 6 weeks old, so maybe the \"snacks\" are actually feedings. \n\nIf the parents are the roommates, then they are the caregivers. It's their responsibility to care for the baby, including feeding at night. So waking them up as a newborn is part of parenting. They should expect that and adjust their schedules. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby's needs come first. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because as a newborn, they can't control their feeding schedule. The parents are there to care for them. The fact that they're the parents means they're supposed to handle this. So the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
