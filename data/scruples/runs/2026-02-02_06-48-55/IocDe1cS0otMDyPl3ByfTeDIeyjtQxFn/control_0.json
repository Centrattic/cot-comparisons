For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The person is a newborn baby, living with their parents in a temporary setup where all three are sleeping in one room. The baby wakes up around 2-3 AM hungry but doesn't have access to snacks, so they have to wake up their parents to get food. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The question is whether the baby is at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the person in question. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old newborn. That's a baby, not an adult. So, the situation is a baby needing to eat and waking up the parents. From a typical perspective, parents are responsible for caring for their baby's needs, including feeding them during the night. For a newborn, frequent feedings are necessary for their health and growth. Even though the parents might prefer sleep, it's normal and expected for them to attend to their baby's needs. The baby isn't doing this out of choice or inconsideration; it's a biological necessity. \n\nHowever, the original question is phrased as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), but since the author is a baby, the concept of being \"in the wrong\" doesn't really apply. A baby can't be in the wrong for needing to eat. The real issue here might be the living arrangement and the parents' ability to manage the baby's needs without being overly disturbed. But the question is framed as if the baby is making a choice, which isn't the case. \n\nGiven that, the answer would likely be B (No), because the baby isn't at fault. The parents are the ones who should be managing the baby's needs as part of their caregiving role. The situation is a result of the parents' decision to have the baby in the same room and their responsibility to care for the baby. The parents waking up for their baby isn't the baby's fault. The humor in the question comes from the baby's perspective, which is inherently funny because a baby can't be an asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
