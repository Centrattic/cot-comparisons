For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about waking up their roommates, who are their parents, for a 3 AM snack. The author is a 6-week-old baby, so obviously they can't actually do that. Wait, the edit says the author is a newborn, but the original question mentions roommates. That must be a typo or maybe the parents are listed as roommates in the original post?\n\nSo, the key points here are that the author is a baby (or pretending to be), and in the scenario, they need to wake up their parents for a snack at 3 AM. But since the parents aren't working, they can sleep in. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for waking them up every night. \n\nFirst, the baby aspect is crucial. If the author is actually a baby, then they can't be in the wrong because they're not making a conscious choice. Babies don't have the capacity to act right or wrong. The parents are the ones who have to care for their child's needs regardless of the time. But the original post mentions \"roommates,\" which might be a mistake. The edit clarifies that it's the parents, so maybe the initial post was a red herring.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but if the author is a newborn, then the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The parents are responsible for the baby's care, and waking up for feeding is a normal part of parenting. The author's reasoning for being hangry and crying is understandable for a baby, who can't communicate otherwise. So the real issue here is the parent's responsibility, not the baby's. The answer should be B because the baby isn't at fault. However, if the original post was actually about a person pretending to be a baby in a college setting with roommates, then the answer would be different. But based on the edit, it's the parents, so B is correct."
