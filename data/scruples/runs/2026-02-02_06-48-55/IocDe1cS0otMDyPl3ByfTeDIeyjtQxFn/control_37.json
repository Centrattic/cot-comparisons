For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is a newborn (but wait, that's the edit part), is waking up their parents, who are roommates, in the middle of the night for a snack. The parents aren't working, so maybe they can sleep in. The author says they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat at 3 AM. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the author. Oh, wait, the edit says they're a 6-week-old baby. That changes things a lot. A newborn can't really choose to wake up for a snack; they just need to eat. So the original question is framed as if the author is an adult, but the edit clarifies it's a baby. So maybe the parents are the ones who are being asked if they're in the wrong for waking others up, but that's not the case here. Wait, the original scenario says the author is the one waking up the roommates (the parents) for a snack. But if the author is a baby, they don't have the ability to do that. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait, the original question's setup is that the author is a person living with roommates (a married couple), all in one room. But then the edit says the author is a newborn, and the married couple are the parents. So maybe the parents are being asked if they're in the wrong for waking up the baby? No, the original post says the author is waking up the roommates (the parents) for a snack. But if the author is a baby, then the baby can't wake up the parents. Instead, the parents are likely the ones feeding the baby. So perhaps there's confusion here.\n\nWait, the original question is from the perspective of the author being a person (not a baby) but the edit states that the author is a baby. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the edit. If the author is a baby, then the question isn't about the baby being in the wrong, since a baby can't be at fault. But the original question is structured as if the author is an adult. So maybe the edit is a trick or a red herring. \n\nAssuming the edit is correct, and the author is a 6-week-old baby, then the scenario is different. The baby needs to eat at night, which is normal. The parents (roommates) are being woken up by the baby's cries to feed it. The parents aren't working, so their sleep is less important. In that case, the baby isn't in the wrong. But the original question is phrased as if the author is the one making the choice, which a baby can't do. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nIf we take the original scenario without the edit, where the author is an adult, then waking up roommates every night for a snack might be considered inconsiderate, even if it's for a valid reason. However, if the parents are not working and can sleep in, maybe it's more acceptable. But if the author is an adult, needing to eat at 3 AM might not be as justified as a baby needing to eat. \n\nBut given the edit clarifies the author is a baby, which is a newborn. So the parents being woken up by the baby's cries to feed it is normal and necessary. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because a baby has no control over their hunger and needs to eat. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby. However, since the original question is from the author's perspective (the baby), which is a newborn, the question seems to be a joke or a trick. \n\nBut the user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. Since the author is a baby, they can't be in the wrong. So the answer is B. However, if the user intended the original scenario without the edit (adult author), then the answer might be A or B. But because the edit is there, the correct answer is B.\n"
