For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The key points here are that the person is a six-week-old baby, all living in one room temporarily, and the parents have all the snacks. The baby wakes up hungry and needs a snack, which requires waking the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the person. The user mentioned that the author is a 6-week-old newborn/baby. That's a critical detail. Infants can't eat snacks on their own or access food without help. At that age, they need to be fed by a caregiver. So, the baby can't be at fault here because they can't control their own hunger or access food independently. \n\nNext, the parents are the ones with the snacks, and the baby has no easy access. The baby waking up hungry is a natural biological need. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in, but if the baby is hungry, they need to be fed. The baby's request for a snack (through waking up the parents) is actually part of the parents' responsibility as caregivers. \n\nThe original question is whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong. Since the baby can't be held responsible for their actions, especially basic needs like feeding, the answer would lean towards \"No, the baby is not in the wrong.\" The situation is a result of living arrangements and the baby's dependency on the parents for nourishment. The parents might need to adjust how they manage the snacks or find a way to make nighttime feeding easier, but the baby isn't at fault here. \n\nAlso, the parents are the ones who have the means to provide the snack, so it's their responsibility to ensure the baby is fed without being unnecessarily disturbed. The baby's hunger is a legitimate need, and the parents are expected to attend to it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
