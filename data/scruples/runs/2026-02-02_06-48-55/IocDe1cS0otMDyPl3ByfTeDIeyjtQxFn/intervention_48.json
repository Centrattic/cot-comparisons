For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in the same room because of some reasons. The author, who is a newborn, needs a snack at night but can't access it without waking up their parents, who are the roommates. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, which changes things a lot. Newborns have different needs compared to adults. They can't regulate hunger the same way and need to eat frequently. However, the original question is from the perspective of someone who is a \"6 week old newborn/baby,\" but the way the question is phrased might be a bit of a trick. Wait, if the author is a newborn, they wouldn't be making the decision to wake up their parents. So maybe the question is a humorous twist, but the edit clarifies that the author is the baby, and the parents are the roommates.\n\nIn that case, the parents are the ones who have to care for the baby, which includes feeding them at night. So from a typical perspective, parents are expected to handle their baby's needs regardless of the time. However, the original question was presented as if the author is an adult making the choice to wake up roommates. But when we know the author is a baby, the situation is different. \n\nIf the author was an adult, waking up roommates every night at 3 AM for snacks might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it's a regular occurrence. But since the author is a baby, it's not their fault. However, the original question is presented as if the author is an adult, and the edit is a twist. So maybe the user is testing if I consider the baby scenario. The real issue is whether the person is in the wrong when they're a newborn, but the parents are the ones responsible for feeding them. \n\nIn reality, parents are expected to care for their baby's needs, including feeding them at night. So if the author is the baby, they aren't in the wrong because they can't help their needs. But the original question is from the perspective of the author as an adult, which makes the situation different. However, the edit reveals the twist, so maybe the user is trying to see if the answer accounts for that.\n\nGiven that, the answer would depend on the actual scenario. If the person is an adult, then waking up roommates every night for snacks without any consideration might be inconsiderate, especially if it's disrupting their sleep. But if the person is a baby, they're not at fault. However, since the edit clarifies that the author is a baby, the answer should reflect that, but the original question presents the author as an adult. But the user is asking for the answer based on the scenario as presented, including the edit.\n\nSo considering all that, the correct answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is a baby, and parents are responsible for their care. However, if the original question was meant to be a hypothetical where an adult is in that situation, then the answer might be A. But given the edit, the answer is B.\n"
