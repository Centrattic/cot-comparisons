For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a newborn baby living with their parents in a temporary setup where everyone's sleeping in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and needs a snack, but the parents have all the snacks. The baby has to wake them up to get something to eat. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby gets really cranky and even cries if they don't eat at that time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so they're not an adult. Newborns typically have different needs, like frequent feedings. However, in this case, the question mentions the author is a \"6 week old newborn/baby,\" so maybe the snack refers to something beyond regular feeding, or perhaps the baby is used to a different schedule. Wait, but the edit says the author is a baby, which changes things. If the baby is a newborn, then waking the parents up for feedings is actually normal. Newborns need to eat every few hours. But the question is framed as the author being an adult, but the edit clarifies the author is a baby. That's a bit confusing. Wait, the original question is from the user, but in the scenario, the author is a baby. Wait, no, the user is asking about the situation where they are a baby. So the user is a baby, and the roommates are their parents. So the baby is waking their parents up for a snack. \n\nBut as a baby, the baby can't really make a decision to wake them up; they're just acting on instinct. However, the question is phrased as \"AITA for waking my roommates up for a snack?\" So if the author is a baby, then the question is whether the baby is in the wrong. But babies can't be in the wrong for needing to eat. However, maybe the situation is that the baby is eating snacks, which implies they're older than a newborn. Wait, the edit says \"6 week old newborn/baby.\" So maybe the baby is a very young infant. Newborns don't eat snacks; they eat breast milk or formula. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the baby is a toddler, but the edit says 6 weeks. So this is a bit confusing. \n\nAssuming that the author is a baby who needs to eat at night, it's normal for parents to be woken up for feedings. But if the baby is older and eating solid foods, but still a 6-week-old, that's not typical. So there might be some inconsistency in the scenario. Regardless, given the edit, the author is a baby, and the parents are the roommates. The baby's needs are fundamental. Parents are expected to care for their child's needs, even if it means waking up multiple times at night. Therefore, the author (the baby) is not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No. The parents (as roommates) are responsible for the baby's care, so waking them up for necessary feedings is expected and not the baby's fault.\n"
