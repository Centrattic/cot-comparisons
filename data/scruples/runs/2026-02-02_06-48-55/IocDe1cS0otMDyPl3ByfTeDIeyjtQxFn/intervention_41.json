For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author is a newborn, living with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment where they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The parents have all the snacks, and the author can't access them without waking the parents up. The author gets very hungry in the middle of the night, becomes hangry, and cries if they don't eat. The question is whether the author is at fault for this nightly disruption.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is a newborn, so they can't help their hunger or their need to eat. But wait, newborns typically eat every few hours, right? The parents, who are not working, can sleep in. The author is waking them up, but maybe that's just part of having a newborn. However, the parents are the ones who chose to have the baby stay with them. \n\nBut the question is from the perspective of the author being in the wrong. If the author is a baby, they can't be at fault because they can't control their actions. The problem might be that the parents didn't set up the situation properly, like having snacks accessible or arranging the living space differently. However, the author's edit clarifies that they are the newborn. So the question is phrased as if the author is the baby, but the AITA format usually comes from an adult's perspective. This might be a joke or a trick question.\n\nWait, the original post says the author is a 6-week-old newborn/baby. So the author is the baby, and the parents are the ones being woken up. But the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby. However, the question is phrased as if the baby is asking if they're in the wrong, which is a bit odd. In reality, the parents might be the ones to consider, but since the question is from the author's perspective, and the author is a baby, maybe the answer is that the baby isn't at fault. But the options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. If the author is the baby, then the answer would be B (not wrong), because the baby can't be blamed for eating. However, the parents might need to adjust their situation. But according to the AITA rules, the user is asking if they are in the wrong, so if the user is the baby, they can't be at fault. But this is a hypothetical scenario presented as a real AITA question. Maybe the real issue is that the parents didn't arrange for the baby to have snacks available without waking them up. But given the information, the answer would be B because the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat. Alternatively, maybe the user meant they are an adult, but the edit says they are a baby. So it's a joke, but the answer would still depend on the perspective. Since the user is asking if the author is wrong, and the author is a baby, the answer is B.\n"
