For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a newborn living with their parents, all temporarily in one bedroom. The parents have given them snacks, but the author needs to wake them up around 2-3 AM to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so waking them up isn't affecting their work schedule. The author gets very hungry and even cries if they don't eat at that time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, which is a critical time where sleep patterns are not yet established. Newborns typically breastfeed every 2-3 hours, so waking up at night is normal for feeding. If the author is breastfeeding, they might not have the option to wait until morning because they need to eat frequently. However, the question mentions a \"snack,\" which is a bit confusing because newborns don't eat solid snacks. Maybe there's a translation or wording issue here. The original problem might actually be about feeding (breastmilk or formula), not solid food. But the user edited to clarify the state and the baby aspect, so maybe the snack is a misstatement.\n\nAssuming the author is a newborn, they can't control their sleep-wake cycle. The parents, as adults, are used to the baby's needs. Since the parents are not working, their ability to sleep in isn't affected by being woken up. The author isn't at fault here because their needs are biological and necessary for survival. Parents understand that newborns need frequent feedings. So, in this context, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are aware of the situation and should be accommodating. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). However, if the \"snack\" is a solid food item and the author is older, that changes things. But given the edit specifying a newborn, it's likely about feeding, so the answer is B.\n"
