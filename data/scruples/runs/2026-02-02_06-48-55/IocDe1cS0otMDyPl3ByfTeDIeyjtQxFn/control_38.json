For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a snack every night around 2 or 3 AM. The roommates are their parents, and they're all temporarily living in one room. The author is a newborn, so maybe that affects things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is a baby, so they probably can't help their hunger at night. Babies often need to eat frequently, especially if they're only six weeks old. But the question is whether the author is at fault. Wait, the edit says the author is a newborn/baby. So the original question is written by the baby's parent? Or is the author the baby? The edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" That's confusing because the original post is written in first person. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Oh, wait, maybe the person is asking as the baby's parent, but the edit clarifies that the author is a baby. So the situation is that a baby is waking up the parents for a snack every night. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in. The baby can't help it that they need to eat that late. \n\nBabies typically need to eat every few hours, especially in the early months. So at 2 or 3 AM, a 6-week-old might need to eat. The parents are the ones who have the snacks, and since they're not working, they can handle the baby's needs. The question is whether the baby (the author) is in the wrong for waking them up. But babies aren't expected to understand social norms in the same way adults do. They can't control their hunger. The parents are the ones responsible for caring for the baby. So in this context, it's not the baby's fault. The answer would be B (No). The parents are the ones who have to deal with it because they're the caregivers. The original post might have been a trick question to see if people consider the age of the person. The edit is crucial here because without it, the answer might be different if the author was an adult. But with the edit, it's clear that the author is a baby, so it's not their fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
