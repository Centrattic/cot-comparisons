For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a snack. The situation is that they're sharing an apartment with their parents, all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is a newborn, so that's a key point.\n\nFirst, the main issue is waking up the parents multiple times a night. The author mentions they're hungry and need a snack at 2-3 AM. But they have to wake the parents, who aren't working, so maybe they can sleep in. However, being a newborn, their habits are different. Newborns eat frequently, so that's a biological need.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know the perspective. Considering the edit that the author is a 6-week-old baby, this changes things. Babies can't help their eating schedules. The parents are the ones who chose to have a newborn, so they might be expected to accommodate the baby's needs. However, the parents might also be adjusting to the baby's schedule.\n\nBut the question is from the perspective of right and wrong. If the author is a baby, it's not their fault. The parents are responsible for the baby's needs. However, the original post is written in the style of an AITA question, which is usually from an adult's perspective. The humor here is that the author is literally a baby, so the answer would be different. \n\nSo, the real question is whether a baby is in the wrong for needing to eat and waking up the parents. Since a baby can't be at fault, the answer is no. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), because the author is a baby and can't be wrong. The humor in the situation is that the baby can't be in the wrong, but the parents might be struggling, but the question is about the baby's fault.\n"
