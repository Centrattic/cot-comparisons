For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in the same room. The author is a newborn, so that's important. The parents (the married couple) aren't working, so they don't have early commitments.\n\nFirst, the author is a baby, so they can't be blamed for needing to eat. Newborns need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours. But the parents have to feed them. However, the question is framed as the author waking them up. Wait, but the author is a baby. So maybe the parents are the ones being woken up to feed the baby. The original scenario mentions the author has to wake the roommate (mom) up to get a snack. But as a newborn, the baby can't get snacks themselves; they need to be fed. So maybe there's a mix-up in the question. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby, so the parents are the ones who have to feed them. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby's needs require them to be woken up. \n\nIn that case, the parents are not at fault for waking up to feed their baby. It's a natural part of having a newborn. The baby can't help needing frequent feedings. The parents probably have to do this regardless. So the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B. But maybe I need to check if there's any aspect where the parents could adjust. But given that the baby is 6 weeks old, it's expected that feedings are frequent. The parents should be used to it by now. Also, the baby can't control their hunger. So answer B.\n"
