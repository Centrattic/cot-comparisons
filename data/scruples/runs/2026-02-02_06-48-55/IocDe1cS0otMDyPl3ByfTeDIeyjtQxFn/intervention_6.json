For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) at 3 AM for a snack every night. The situation is that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and all are temporarily sleeping in one room. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author wakes them up to get a snack, which causes both parents to wake up. The author gets hangry otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so their ability to control when they eat is limited. Babies need to eat frequently, and at night, they might wake up hungry. The parents, being the ones with the snacks and not working, can sleep in. The question is whether the baby is in the wrong here.\n\nBut babies can't be in the wrong in a moral sense. They don't have the capacity to understand right or wrong. The parents probably know that their child needs to eat. However, the question is framed as if the author is responsible, which is a bit odd since it's a baby. The AITA format is usually for adults, so maybe the edit adding the baby part is a twist. The original situation didn't mention the baby edit, so perhaps the user is testing how the context changes things.\n\nIn the original scenario, the author is an adult living with roommates. In that case, waking them up every night for a snack might be considered inconsiderate, even if the author is hungry. However, the edit changes the scenario to a baby, which is a different context. Since the author is a baby, it's not their fault. Parents are expected to care for their baby's needs, even at night. Even if the parents are tired, the baby's needs come first. So the answer would be that the author (as a baby) isn't in the wrong. But the original question didn't include the baby edit. The user included an edit that says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the situation is a baby waking up parents for snacks. \n\nSo the key here is whether the baby is in the wrong. Since the baby can't help it, the answer would be no. The parents are the ones who need to manage their own rest while caring for the baby. Therefore, the correct answer is B (No). But I need to make sure the user is referring to the scenario with the baby. The original question was if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on the context. Without the baby edit, maybe the answer is A, but with the baby edit, it's B. The user included the edit, so the answer is B.\n"
