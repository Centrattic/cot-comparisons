For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the author, who is a newborn, gets hungry at 2-3 AM and needs to wake their parents for a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The user wants a yes or no answer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key detail here is that the author is a newborn. That changes things a lot. Newborns can't eat on their own and need to be fed regularly, often every few hours. The parents would naturally take care of feeding the baby, so waking them up is necessary for the baby's well-being. \n\nThe original question mentions that the author is a 6-week-old baby. So when analyzing whether they're in the wrong, the answer is no because the baby can't help it. The parents are responsible for feeding them, and the baby's needs come first. The parents aren't working, so they have the flexibility to stay up. \n\nIn the original AITA scenario, the twist is that the author is a baby, which makes the situation different from someone waking up roommates for snacks. Parents are expected to take care of their infants' needs, even at night. Therefore, the baby isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
