She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they would be in the wrong if they broke up with their girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has a history of childhood sexual abuse by family members, which she only recently shared with her boyfriend. Their relationship has been long-term, and the boyfriend had initially thought her reasons for not having sex were religious. Now that he knows the truth, he's struggling with how to handle it. He's feeling a mix of emotions\u2014discomfort, anger, guilt, and a desire to be supportive but also a fear of not being able to handle it long-term. He mentioned that he can't have sex with her anymore because he doesn't want her to associate their intimacy with her abusers. He also feels like he's the only one she can talk to besides her therapist, so if he leaves, she might never open up again.\n\nSo, the key points here are her past trauma, her decision to confide in him, and his reaction. The question is whether breaking up with her is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend's initial reaction is understandable\u2014trauma and PTSD are serious, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. He's experiencing some negative emotions, which he's trying to process. However, he's also acknowledging that he wants to be there for her but is unsure. The dilemma is whether he's being selfish or self-aware in this situation.\n\nOn the other hand, she trusted him with her deep, painful secret. By breaking up, would he be hurting her emotionally and potentially affecting her ability to trust others in the future? Also, he's considering leaving because he's not sure if he can handle the lifelong commitment to support her through this. Is that a valid reason, or is it a cop-out? \n\nIt's important to consider the ethical responsibility here. The author isn't at fault for having an initial negative reaction; everyone processes such information differently. However, if he decides to break up because he's not equipped to handle the situation, and not because there's a lack of effort on his part to support her, then he might be in the wrong. The girlfriend has already been through a lot, and the trust she placed in him by sharing her trauma is significant. Leaving could make her feel betrayed or like she shouldn't have shared her secret. \n\nBut at the same time, he has his own emotional well-being to consider. If he's not able to support her effectively and is causing her pain by staying (due to his discomfort), maybe walking away is a consideration. However, the question is not about whether it's easier for him but whether he's in the wrong for doing so. \n\nThe line between self-care and being inconsiderate is thin here. If he's making the decision out of a genuine inability to cope and not because of her trauma itself, it's a complex issue. But given that he still loves her and is struggling with the decision, and he's trying to weigh his feelings against her needs, it's not clear-cut. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having these feelings, but acting on them by breaking up might be if he hasn't given himself enough time to adjust or if he hasn't properly communicated with her about his feelings. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering the breakup. The answer could depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, supporting a partner through trauma is seen as a responsibility in a committed relationship. If he can't do that, maybe staying would be the right choice even if it's hard. Alternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's making a difficult decision based on his own capacity to support her. \n\nI need to decide between A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No, he's not). Considering all factors, I think the answer is B (No), because his reaction isn't malicious, but it's a tough situation. However, if he chooses to leave, he should be aware of the impact it might have on her. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering it. Since he's trying to process and is conflicted, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
