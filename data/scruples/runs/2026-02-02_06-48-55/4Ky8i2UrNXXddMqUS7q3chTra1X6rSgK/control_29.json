She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was being honest about her past abuse when she finally opened up. She had been withholding that information because of the trauma, using religion as an excuse. Now that she's shared her story, the author feels uncomfortable and is considering breaking up with her. The main question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way and considering leaving.\n\nThe author mentions several reasons: he's struggling with the fact that she lied about being religious, he's uncomfortable with her trauma, and he's afraid of not being able to support her. He also admits he doesn't want to have sex with her anymore because he's worried she'll think of her abusers. That's a big issue because it's about consent and respecting her boundaries. \n\nBut wait, she opened up about her abuse because she trusted him. By considering leaving, he might be punishing her for something that's not her fault. Also, he's admitting he's not comfortable with her trauma, but that's not her fault either. The fact that she went to therapy and shared this with him shows she's trying to work through it. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nHe also says he feels like he's not the right person for her because of her \"damage,\" which is a harmful way to look at someone's trauma. Trauma doesn't make someone damaged; it's a result of abuse. He's putting the burden on himself to fix her, which isn't realistic. \n\nThe author is struggling with his own emotions and fears, but he's the one who's supposed to be supportive. He's also worried about how she'll react if he breaks up with her, which shows he cares but maybe he's not ready to handle the situation. \n\nIn relationships, when someone shares such a traumatic experience, the partner is expected to be supportive. Walking away because of trauma might be considered wrong. However, if the author isn't able to provide the support she needs, maybe it's better to leave for her well-being. But the way he's thinking about it, blaming her for the situation, seems unfair. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably yes. He's in a position where he needs to work on his feelings and seek help to support her, rather than leaving. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's struggling but hasn't acted yet, maybe the answer is A because his intentions to leave based on his inability to cope might be wrong.\n"
