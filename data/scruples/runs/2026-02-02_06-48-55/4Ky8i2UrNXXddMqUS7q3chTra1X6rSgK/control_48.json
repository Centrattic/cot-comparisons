She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she disclosed her past abuse.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a history of sexual abuse, which she didn't reveal right away. She used religion as an excuse for her hesitancy in the relationship. The author was initially okay with that, even though it frustrated him. Now that she's opened up, he's struggling with feelings of discomfort, anger, and fear about their future. He's considering breaking up because he feels he can't handle being with someone with such a traumatic past, even though he loves her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about support in a relationship when there's trauma involved. The girlfriend needed to confide in him, which is a significant act of trust. He's having emotional responses, but is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nIn relationships where one partner has trauma, the other partner's support is crucial. The author is feeling overwhelmed and doesn't know how to help. But walking away might harm her, especially since she's vulnerable. However, he might not be the right support system for her. The decision to stay or leave isn't just about his feelings but also about her well-being.\n\nThe author's guilt and conflict suggest he cares deeply. He's trying to figure out if his feelings are normal or if he's being selfish. The fact that he's questioning his own feelings and seeking advice shows some self-awareness. However, the core issue is whether his reaction is justified. It's important to consider if his reasons for wanting to break up are based on valid concerns or just personal discomfort.\n\nHe's afraid that their future together will be a \"lifelong battle\" and doesn't want to be in a relationship where he can't be physically intimate without her trauma being triggered. That's a significant issue, but it's also something that requires patience, understanding, and possibly professional help. Walking away might leave her without the support she needs, especially since she hasn't told anyone else.\n\nOn the other hand, if he can't get past these feelings and truly support her, staying might be harmful in the long run. But is he in the wrong for feeling that way? Not necessarily. People have different capacities to handle their partner's trauma. However, the fact that he's considering breaking up because of her trauma, even though it's not her fault, could be seen as a failure to support her. \n\nThe answer would depend on societal views on support in relationships. If the author is unwilling to work through this with her, he might be in the wrong because he's abandoning her when she needs support. But if he genuinely feels he can't provide the necessary support and it's not fair to either of them, maybe not. However, the way he's framing it (focusing on his discomfort rather than her needs) suggests that he's prioritizing his own feelings over hers, which is a red flag. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for considering leaving due to her trauma rather than trying to find solutions with her.\n"
