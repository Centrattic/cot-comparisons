She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong if he breaks up with his girlfriend after she opens up about past abuse. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author, a 20-year-old guy, has been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She had a reputation as a tease because of her religious beliefs about not having sex before marriage. He was initially okay with that, even though he was disappointed. Over time, he noticed she wasn't actually religious, just held onto that belief for the sexual aspect. She eventually started a sexual relationship with him, but it wasn't satisfying for him. He felt she wasn't into it, maybe because of her past.\n\nThen, after three years, she confides in him about being sexually abused by family members as a child. She explains that her reluctance to have sex was due to that trauma, not religion. He feels hurt and confused, thinking she lied to him. He's struggling with the emotional burden and is considering breaking up because he's afraid of triggering her, doesn't want to hear about the abuse, and feels he's not the right partner for someone with such a traumatic past. He's also worried about his feelings of anger and discomfort, even though he loves her.\n\nNow, the user's question is whether he's in the wrong if he leaves. The user says they think he is, but want others' opinions. \n\nTo determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The key points are: she opened up about her trauma, which is a significant step in any relationship. He acknowledges that he's struggling with the information but feels he isn't the right person to support her. However, breaking up after she confided in him could be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time. \n\nOn the other hand, staying in a relationship where one partner is emotionally overwhelmed might not be healthy for either. The author is experiencing guilt and anxiety, which could lead to resentment or a toxic dynamic if they stay. But leaving might hurt her deeply, especially since she never told anyone before and trusted him enough to share.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for his feelings. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by someone else's trauma. However, using those feelings as a reason to leave might be considered abandoning her, especially if she's still in therapy and needs support. The fact that she's been quiet since he expressed discomfort suggests she's hurt by his reaction.\n\nThe ethical consideration here is whether staying in the relationship is feasible for both parties. If he can't provide the support she needs, he might be doing her a favor by not staying in a potentially harmful situation. But if he leaves, he's not giving her the chance to work through it with him. However, the decision isn't straightforward. The author is in a difficult position, but the act of leaving isn't necessarily unethical if it's done with consideration and support, perhaps by encouraging her to seek continued help and not holding it against her.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the decision to break up might be seen as the lesser of two evils to avoid a harmful situation. However, the way he handles the breakup is crucial. If he's honest and compassionate, he might not be in the wrong. But given the circumstances, leaving could be seen as abandonment, making him at least partially responsible. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. Since the user's own opinion is that he is in the wrong, and given the complexities, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong). But I need to make sure.\n"
