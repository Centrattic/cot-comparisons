She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend because she finally opened up about her past abuse, which he now realizes was the real reason she was hesitant about sex, not just religion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girl had a history of sexual abuse by family members, which she kept secret. She used religion as an excuse for not having sex earlier. When she finally told him the truth, he felt uncomfortable, even though he said he supported her. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't get past the trauma and feels he might not be the right partner for her long-term. He's considering breaking up to avoid being a burden on her recovery.\n\nThe author is questioning if he's in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to analyze both sides.\n\nThe girlfriend did the right thing by opening up to her partner after seeking therapy. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and sharing such a sensitive issue shows vulnerability. The author's reaction is conflicted; he feels disconnected and doesn't want to be in a relationship where she's constantly dealing with trauma. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nOn one hand, the author is struggling with his emotions. He feels that he can't support her and that the relationship will be a lifelong battle. However, walking away might make her feel that her trauma is a reason to leave her, which could be retraumatizing. Relationships require work, especially when dealing with past trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, he might not be the right support system for her. If he can't handle the emotional load, it's possible the breakup is necessary for both of them. But the timing and the way he's considering leaving after she opened up could be seen as abandoning her when she needs support.\n\nThe key here is whether it's fair to end a relationship because of factors beyond the partner's control. The girl's trauma wasn't her fault, and she's working on it. The author's decision to break up might be based on his own inability to cope, not her actions. However, staying might be unfair if he can't provide the support she needs.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on societal expectations and the responsibilities in a relationship. Usually, partners are expected to support each other through challenges. If he can't do that, he might be at fault for not being there for her. However, it's also valid if he realizes he's not equipped to handle it, especially if staying would be harmful to both.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. He did express his feelings, which is important. She felt worse after his reaction, which complicates things. Breaking up might be the right choice if he's not able to move past these feelings, but it's a difficult situation where neither choice is perfect. The focus is on his responsibility as a partner.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong because he's walking away after she trusted him with her trauma, which is a critical moment in a relationship. However, it's a complex situation where both have valid emotions. But from a standpoint of support and partnership, leaving might be seen as abandoning her during her time of need, which is a failure in the role of a supportive partner. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
