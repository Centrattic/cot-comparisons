She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. \n\nThe author is a guy in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She had a reputation for being a tease, but she explained that it's because of her religious beliefs against premarital sex. Over time, he noticed she wasn't really religious except in that one aspect. They had sex after about 2.75 years, but it wasn't satisfying for him as she was timid. Then, she revealed in therapy that she had been sexually abused by family members as a child. She told him this because it's affecting their sexual relationship, and she used religion as an excuse before. Now, he's struggling with how to handle this. He feels distant, doesn't want to hear about it, and is considering breaking up because he doesn't think he can handle being with someone with such trauma. He's conflicted because he still loves her a lot.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's decision to open up about her abuse. That's a big step, and she did it because she trusts him. It's important to note that she was the one who initiated this conversation, and she did so in a supportive context (therapy). The author's reaction is mixed. He feels heartbroken, has mixed emotions, and admits he's angry about her lying. But he also recognizes her trust and feels guilty when he told her it bothers him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about empathy, support, and the responsibility of a partner when someone discloses trauma. The author is conflicted because he's not sure if his reaction is normal or if he's being an asshole. He's considering breaking up because he feels he's not the right person to be with someone with such a history. \n\nIs he in the wrong for wanting to break up? Well, the girlfriend's disclosure was a vulnerable act. She needed support and understanding. The author's immediate reaction was to consider leaving, which could be seen as abandoning her during a time when she needed him most. Even if he's struggling, the fact that he's aware of her need for support and is conflicted makes me think that his intentions aren't entirely malicious. However, the decision to leave after she opened up to him could be seen as a betrayal of the trust she placed in him. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's afraid she'll bring it up again, which indicates he's not ready to engage with her trauma. In a healthy relationship, partners need to work through such challenges together. Walking away might be an easy solution, but it's not supportive. \n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that he's not the right person for her if he can't provide the support she needs. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering that. The wrong part would be if he's being judgmental or not giving her the support she needs. However, the author is struggling and is seeking advice, which shows he's trying to make the right decision. \n\nBut the act of breaking up because of her trauma, even if he's conflicted, could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend is already dealing with PTSD and the aftermath of abuse. Leaving could exacerbate her trauma, making her feel unloved or that she's too damaged to be in a relationship. The author's anger about her lying in the past might also be a factor; but her lying was a protective measure due to her trauma, not a malicious act. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a difficult position. However, the decision to break up solely because of her trauma, without making a genuine effort to support her, could be seen as him being in the wrong. The girlfriend took a risk to open up, and the partner's response is crucial. If he can't handle it, perhaps it's better for her to be with someone who can. But the fact that he's considering breaking up immediately after her vulnerability might be hasty. \n\nThe answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) if he chooses to leave without trying to support her. However, if he's genuinely trying to figure out the right path and is conflicted, maybe not. But according to the scenario, he's leaning towards breaking up because he feels he's not the right person. The key is that he's prioritizing his own discomfort over her need for support, which is a significant issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
