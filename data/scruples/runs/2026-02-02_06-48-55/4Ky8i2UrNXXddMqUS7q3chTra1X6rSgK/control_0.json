She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the story is about a guy who's been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She told him that she was religious and didn't want to have sex before marriage. Turns out, she had a history of sexual abuse by family members as a child. She used religion as an excuse to hide that trauma. Now, after she opened up to him, the guy is conflicted. He feels he can't be there for her because he's uncomfortable with her trauma, and he's considering breaking up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the guy is in the wrong. His main issue seems to be that he's upset she didn't tell him about the abuse earlier, but he also acknowledges that she trusted him enough to share this. He mentions that he's frustrated because he wanted more physical intimacy and that she was not as responsive as he hoped. But after she reveals her trauma, he's struggling to accept it and is considering breaking up. \n\nThe key points here are: Did he have the right to expect her to disclose her trauma earlier? Well, trauma survivors often take time to share such information. She did eventually tell him, and the fact that she shared it shows trust. The guy's reaction is a mix of guilt and discomfort. He's worried about her well-being but can't handle the emotional burden. \n\nBreaking up because of her trauma seems harsh. The author is conflicted but is considering leaving her, which could be seen as a betrayal of her trust. He's also concerned about how she'll react if he ends things. However, it's important to consider if staying in the relationship is healthy for both. But given that he's the one struggling emotionally, maybe he's not the one at fault here. Wait, but the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nThe wrongdoing here might be in considering breaking up with her after she entrusted him with such a sensitive issue. Even if he feels overwhelmed, walking away without proper support could be seen as inconsiderate. He's acknowledging that he's not the right person for her because of her needs. But he also loves her and is trying to figure out if his feelings are normal. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and work through issues. If he's not able to handle her trauma and the emotional challenges, maybe it's not the wrong thing to end the relationship, but the way he's thinking about it\u2014feeling guilt and considering breaking up out of fear of not being able to support her\u2014might be the issue. \n\nThe answer could depend on cultural or ethical perspectives. Some might say that he's not in the wrong if he's not equipped to handle her trauma and it's affecting their relationship. Others might argue that he's in the wrong because he's not making an effort to support her. The question is whether his intention to break up is wrong. \n\nGiven that she opened up to him, and he's considering breaking up not because of her actions but because of his own emotional limitations, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the act of breaking up after she shared such a vulnerable part of herself could be seen as him not supporting her, which might make him in the wrong. The fact that he's conflicted and trying to do the right thing shows he's not intentionally malicious, but his decision could still be harmful. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's considering leaving her after she trusted him with her trauma. However, if the relationship isn't healthy for either of them, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the main issue is that he's not providing the support she needs and is walking away, which is inconsiderate.\n"
