She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend after she told him about her past abuse. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend was abusive in the past and struggled with trauma, which affected their relationship. She was holding back from discussing it, using religion as an excuse, and finally opened up to him. The author felt overwhelmed, couldn't help her, didn't want to hear about it, and ended up breaking up. \n\nHe's struggling with his feelings. He loves her but feels he can't support her through this. He's also worried about not being able to have a healthy sexual relationship. He's conflicted between staying and supporting her or ending it because he's not sure he can handle it.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Breaking up isn't inherently wrong, but the reasons matter. If someone is in a position to support their partner but chooses to leave because they can't handle the emotional burden, that might be seen as selfish. However, staying in a relationship when you're not capable of providing the necessary support might not be healthy either.\n\nThe girlfriend opened up to him because she trusted him, and he felt uncomfortable and distanced himself. He also admitted to not wanting to hear about her trauma, which could be traumatic for her if she feels unsupported. His breakup might be based on his inability to cope rather than her actions. \n\nBut he's not the abusive one here. He's reacting to her trauma. However, leaving after she confided in him might hurt her more, especially if she was hoping for support. He might be avoiding his responsibility as a partner. \n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his feelings and tried to communicate, even though it hurt her. He's concerned about his own capacity to support her, which is a valid personal struggle. But maybe the right approach would be to seek couples therapy or personal counseling to work through his feelings instead of breaking up. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he leaves, does that make him the bad guy? Well, staying might be harder and require more effort, but leaving because he can't handle it isn't inherently wrong. However, he should consider the impact on her mental health. He acknowledges she needs him, and leaving could make her feel abandoned. That could be seen as inconsiderate or not supporting her as a partner. \n\nTherefore, the decision to leave might be based on his own emotional needs rather than hers. That could be seen as wrong because he's prioritizing his comfort over her need for support. But he's also in a tough spot, not sure if he can handle the long-term commitment. \n\nI think the key here is whether he's in a position to provide the support she needs. If he can't do that, he's not the right partner for her. But choosing to leave immediately might not be the best approach. Maybe he should explore other options first. However, if he's certain he can't handle it, breaking up might be the responsible choice to avoid hurting her further. \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, he's not the one who caused the trauma. On the other, he chose to be with someone and then left when things got difficult. But his feelings are valid. The question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is A (Yes), because he's choosing to leave when she needs support, which could be seen as abandoning her. But if he's not capable of handling it, maybe it's not his fault. Hmm. I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is A because the act of breaking up after she confided in him could be seen as a betrayal. But maybe B because he's honest and tried to communicate his struggles.\n"
