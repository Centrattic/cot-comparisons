She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author, who's considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she revealed her past abuse, is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and girlfriend have been together for over three years. Initially, the girl had a reputation for being a tease, but she explained it was because of her religious beliefs about not having sex before marriage. The guy was okay with that, but later found out she wasn't really religious. She eventually became comfortable having a sexual relationship, but it wasn't fulfilling for him because she was timid and it felt like a chore. Then, after three years, she revealed she was sexually abused as a child, which is why she had those issues. Now he's conflicted about staying or leaving.\n\nThe key points here are: the girl opened up about her past abuse, which the author is struggling with. He's feeling uncomfortable, doesn't want to have sex anymore, and is considering breaking up. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the girl's decision to share her trauma with him is a vulnerable act. She might have trusted him enough to confide in him. The author's reaction seems to be a mix of guilt, fear, and maybe not knowing how to support her. However, his desire to leave might stem from his own inability to cope with her trauma rather than her actions. \n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has a history of abuse, support and understanding are crucial. The author's main issue is his discomfort and the fear of her bringing up the past during intimacy. He also mentions not wanting to be her partner if it's a lifelong battle. This could indicate a lack of commitment to support her through her recovery, which is a significant responsibility.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not at fault for having these feelings; experiencing such a traumatic revelation can be overwhelming. However, walking away without trying to address these feelings and support her could be seen as selfish. Relationships require work, especially when dealing with trauma. The fact that he's feeling conflicted and is weighing the pros and cons might show that he's not entirely in the wrong, but his decision to leave could be hurtful and abandonment might exacerbate her PTSD.\n\nThe girl has already shared something extremely personal, and the author's reaction is causing her distress. If he leaves, it might make her feel like her trauma isn't acceptable, which is harmful. However, if he stays out of obligation without being able to support her, that's also not healthy for either of them. The right approach would be for him to seek counseling or support for himself to better handle her trauma, ensuring he can be there for her.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling the way he does, but he's in the wrong if he chooses to leave without giving it a real chance to work through the issues. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong period. Since he's struggling and might not be equipped to support her, but he's still loving and trying to figure it out, maybe the answer is more nuanced. However, the act of breaking up solely because of her trauma could be seen as wrong because it invalidates her experience and doesn't support her. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because staying would require effort and commitment to support her, which he might be avoiding.\n"
