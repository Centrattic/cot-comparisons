She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. Early on, he was told she had a reputation for being a tease, but she explained it was because of her religious beliefs, which made her avoid sex before marriage. He was okay with that, even though he was a bit disappointed. Over time, he noticed she wasn't religious otherwise, and after two years, she said she wanted to have sex but was struggling with her upbringing. They started a sexual relationship, but he found it unsatisfying because she was timid and it didn't feel like what he wanted. Then, after three and a half years, she opens up to him about being sexually abused by family members as a child, which he was unaware of. He's having trouble dealing with this\u2014feeling angry, uncomfortable, and not wanting to be intimate with her anymore. He's conflicted between staying with her because he loves her and breaking up because he feels he's not the right person for her given her trauma.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No, he's not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The girlfriend disclosed her past abuse to her partner, which is a very vulnerable act. The author's reaction is mixed\u2014he feels heartbroken, angry at her for lying (she used religion as an excuse instead), uncomfortable during sex, and afraid that being with her might trigger her trauma. He also admits he doesn't want to hear about the abuse anymore, misses how things were before, and is considering breaking up because he feels he can't handle being with someone who has such deep issues. \n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, relationships require trust and support. When someone discloses a traumatic experience, the partner is expected to provide support, understanding, and patience. The author is struggling with this. He acknowledges that her abuse isn't her fault, but his feelings of discomfort and wanting to run are causing him to consider leaving. The girlfriend is now quiet and seems hurt after he told her it bothers him when she talks about it. He's regretful but still considering breaking up.\n\nIs it wrong for him to feel this way? Well, it's normal for people to have initial reactions to such information. However, the decision to break up over this is where the judgment comes in. The girlfriend was honest about her trauma after years of being in the relationship, and while he was initially misled (using religion as an excuse), her reason for not disclosing was because of the trauma. The author is now faced with the reality of her past and is struggling to adjust. \n\nThe key factors here are whether he's being unreasonably dismissive of her needs. He loves her and recognizes her amazing qualities, but he's also feeling that he can't be the right partner for her long-term. Breaking up because he can't handle the emotional burden of her trauma might be seen as selfish or not considering her well-being. However, if he truly feels he can't support her and it's causing him significant distress, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to leave, assuming he's not doing so out of selfishness or blame.\n\nBut the problem is that when someone discloses such a deep trauma, the partner is expected to work through the challenges. If he can't do that, walking away might be seen as not taking responsibility for being a supportive partner. The girlfriend is in therapy, which is a positive step. The author's immediate reaction is to consider leaving, which might not be fair to her, especially since she's already very vulnerable and may not have told anyone else. Breaking up could traumatize her further, as he's the only person she's shared this with besides her therapist.\n\nOn the other hand, if he truly can't move past his feelings and his well-being is suffering, maybe it's not wrong for him to step back. But the ethical consideration is whether he's being a supportive partner. The fact that he's conflicted and trying to figure it out shows he's not malicious, but the decision to break up immediately after she opened up to him might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he's the one who's struggling emotionally rather than her. \n\nAnother angle: she lied to him about her reasons for not having sex (using religion as an excuse instead of her trauma). Could that be a factor? He might feel betrayed, but her reason for lying was to protect her mental health. However, withholding such a significant part of her life could also be seen as a lack of transparency. But the author also knew about the religious excuse for a long time and accepted it. The girlfriend's intention to eventually disclose her trauma when she was ready is understandable given the trauma. The author's anger at the \"lie\" might be misplaced because she was protecting herself.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, if he breaks up, is that wrong? It depends on his intentions. If he's breaking up because he can't support her and this is a permanent issue, then he might be in the wrong because he's not trying to support her through her healing. However, if he realizes he can't handle it and is making the decision to prioritize his mental health while being kind and not blaming her, maybe it's not wrong. The key is whether he's being selfish or trying to be fair to both their needs.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his actions are justified. Given that he's the one who's struggling with his feelings and not her, and that she's the one with the trauma, if he leaves, it's more about his inability to cope rather than her fault. However, in a relationship, partners are expected to support each other through difficult times. Walking away after someone opens up about a trauma could be seen as the partner failing in that role, making him at least partially in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A\u2014Yes, he is in the wrong. Because the girlfriend's disclosure, while difficult, is part of her healing process, and a supportive partner should work through the challenges rather than leave because of them. Even if it's hard, walking away might be considered not fulfilling his role as a supportive partner.\n"
