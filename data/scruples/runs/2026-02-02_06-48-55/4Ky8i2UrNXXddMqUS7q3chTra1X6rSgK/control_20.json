She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong if they break up with his girlfriend after she disclosed her past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend had been in the relationship for over three years and initially gave religious reasons for not having sex. After some time, she opened up about childhood sexual abuse, which explains her struggles with intimacy. The author feels conflicted: he wants to support her but is struggling with the emotional weight, discomfort during sex, and the impact on their relationship. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't know how to handle it and fears being with someone with such trauma.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's disclosure of trauma and the author's response. The girlfriend shared something extremely personal and traumatic, which is a significant act of trust. Her therapist encouraged her to open up, which is part of her healing process. The author's reaction includes feeling a mix of anger, discomfort, and a desire to leave, even though he loves her and admits she's amazing.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not at fault for feeling overwhelmed. However, the ethical question is whether breaking up is justifiable. The girlfriend's trauma isn't her fault, and it's a result of past abuse. The author's decision to leave isn't because of her actions but his own inability to cope. However, relationships require mutual support, and walking away when a partner is vulnerable might be seen as abandoning them, especially since she hasn't done anything wrong. On the other hand, if he feels he can't provide the support she needs, maybe it's a necessary decision for both.\n\nBut in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's disclosure was a step towards healing, and the author's feelings are a natural reaction, but breaking up might be seen as a betrayal of her trust. However, the author isn't at fault for his feelings; he's just realizing the long-term commitment might be too much. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about responsibility in relationships.\n\nIn many perspectives, staying with a partner through their trauma, even if it's challenging, is considered supportive. Leaving because of the emotional burden could be seen as self-serving. However, the author isn't being malicious; he's struggling. So, is he in the wrong? The answer might be A (Yes) because he's not at fault for his feelings, but the action of breaking up after her opening up might be seen as a failure to support her. Alternatively, B (No) because he's not at fault for his honest emotions.\n\nBut considering that the girlfriend's actions were appropriate (disclosing to get help), and the author is reacting to that, the wrong would be on the author if he leaves, as he's the one making a choice to abandon her despite her vulnerability. Therefore, the answer is A. He's not at fault for his feelings, but leaving might be in the wrong. Wait, the options are A for Yes (he is wrong) and B for No (he isn't). So if he's in the wrong for breaking up, answer A. If not, answer B. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, and given that he's reacting to her disclosure which isn't her fault, leaving might be seen as him being in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
