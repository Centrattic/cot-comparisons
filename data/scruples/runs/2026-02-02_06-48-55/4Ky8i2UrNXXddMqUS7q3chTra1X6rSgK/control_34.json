She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been with his girlfriend for over three years. She had a reputation for being a tease, but he found out she was religious and didn't want to have sex before marriage. He was disappointed but stayed with her. After two years, she admitted she wasn't religious but had used that as an excuse because she was dealing with past abuse. Now, after she opened up about being sexually abused as a child, the author is struggling. He feels she lied to him, is uncomfortable with the details, and doesn't want to have sex anymore. He's considering breaking up with her but is conflicted because he still loves her and she's amazing in other ways.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The girlfriend had a traumatic past of sexual abuse, which she didn't disclose initially. She used religion as a cover story. Now, after therapy, she told him the truth. The author is conflicted\u2014feeling angry and uncomfortable, but also loving and supportive. He's considering breaking up because he can't handle the emotional burden of her trauma and the impact it's having on their sexual relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for considering breaking up? Well, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, he's reacting emotionally. He didn't know about her abuse and now feels she lied. He's struggling to support her, which is understandable given the trauma involved. On the other hand, when someone opens up about abuse, the partner is supposed to be supportive. Leaving her might abandon her in a time of need, especially since she confided in him because she trusted him. Also, he admitted that he loves her and sees her as amazing, which complicates matters.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user is asking for a choice between those two. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, if he leaves her, is that wrong? Well, it's possible he's not in the wrong because he's also a human with his own feelings and limits. However, staying in a relationship when she needs support could be seen as the right thing to do. But the problem here is that he's not abusive or intentionally hurting her. He's struggling to cope, which is a personal struggle. \n\nOn the other hand, by breaking up because of her trauma, he might be adding to her pain. She already has PTSD and a history of abuse. If he leaves, she might feel rejected, which could worsen her mental health. The fact that she chose to trust him with her secret shows how important the relationship is to her. His reaction could be seen as invalidating her trauma, which is a serious issue. \n\nBut then again, he's not blaming her for the abuse. He's reacting to the emotional and sexual challenges that come with her trauma. It's possible that he's not in the wrong for feeling that way, but if he acts on those feelings by breaking up, that could be wrong. The key here is whether his reaction is a reasonable one. \n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses abuse, the partner is expected to be supportive. If he can't handle that emotional load, maybe he is in the wrong for not being able to support her. But it's also a tough situation. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to hurt her, but his feelings are valid to some extent. \n\nAnother angle: he mentioned that he's trying to support her, but he's struggling. He's admitted he regrets being honest about his discomfort when she talks about her abuse. That shows he's aware of his responsibility to be supportive. However, his feelings of wanting to leave are still there. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if he's truly not abusive and wants to be there but is overwhelmed, maybe the wrong isn't entirely on him. But by considering leaving because of her trauma, it could be seen as abandoning her during a critical time. \n\nI think the key here is that while his feelings are real, the decision to leave might be seen as inconsiderate of her needs. He's acknowledging that she's amazing and that he loves her, which suggests that his main issue is his own inability to cope, not any fault on hers. So, the wrong, if any, would be in his decision to leave rather than his feelings. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong for considering breaking up. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, supporting a partner through trauma is a significant responsibility. If he can't fulfill that role, maybe he's not the right partner for her. However, that doesn't mean he's in the wrong. It's a personal struggle. \n\nAlternatively, by breaking up, he might be failing to provide the necessary support, which could be seen as morally wrong. But since he feels he can't handle it, the question of whether he's in the wrong is complex. \n\nIn terms of the initial question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI'm leaning towards A because leaving a partner who has disclosed past trauma and is seeking help could be seen as not standing by her. However, it's also important to consider that he's not in an abusive situation himself, and his own well-being is also a factor. But in the context of the question, the primary wrong would be in his decision to leave when she needs support. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that he's not abusive, and his feelings are valid, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he's considering leaving because of her trauma might be seen as wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer here is A. The author is in the wrong because he's considering breaking up after she disclosed her trauma, which is a critical time for support. Even if he's struggling, the fact that she trusted him with her secret and is now in therapy means that leaving her could be harmful. His reaction might be a natural emotional response, but acting on it by breaking up could be seen as abandoning her, which is morally wrong.\n"
