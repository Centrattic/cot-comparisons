She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past sexual abuse. The key points are: the girlfriend had a history of abuse, which she finally revealed after being in a three-year relationship. The author had previously thought her reasons for not having sex earlier were religious, but now he realizes it's due to trauma. He's struggling with feelings of discomfort, fear that he might trigger her, and the emotional burden of knowing her history. He's considering breaking up because he feels he can't handle the lifelong battle of supporting her, and he's worried about his emotional well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong here. The girlfriend confided in him because she trusted him, and she was being honest about her trauma. The author is now feeling conflicted, but the question is whether his decision to break up is wrong.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She opened up to him, which was a huge step. She was being truthful and trying to work through her issues. She didn't force him or hide the truth from the start; she only revealed it when she felt ready. The author's response is that he can't handle the emotional weight and the potential for future conflict. He's feeling guilty for initially being honest about his discomfort but then regretting it.\n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. He's not forcing the relationship to continue if he's unhappy. On the other hand, breaking up because of her trauma could be seen as abandoning her when she's vulnerable. The girlfriend might feel blamed or think it's her fault, even though it's not. However, the author is also considering his own emotional health, which is valid.\n\nBut the key point is whether breaking up is the wrong decision. In many cases, partners are expected to support each other through difficult times, including mental health and trauma. However, if the author feels he can't provide the support needed and it's causing him significant distress, he might not be the right partner for her. But by breaking up, he might be causing her more harm if she's already struggling with PTSD and needs support.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's breaking up because of her past trauma, which is not her fault, then yes, he might be judged as abandoning her. However, if he's making a decision based on his own ability to cope, it's a complex situation. But the way he frames it, he's considering leaving because of his own feelings rather than any fault of hers. But the act of leaving after she's opened up could be seen as a betrayal of trust. However, the initial breakup is framed as a mutual decision in the question, but the author is the one considering it.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, being supportive is crucial. But the author is also allowed to prioritize his mental health. However, breaking up because of her trauma could be seen as callous. However, if he's truly unable to support her and they're both unhappy, maybe it's better for them to part ways. However, the way he expresses regret and love suggests he's conflicted. The fact that he's considering the impact on her if he breaks up now shows he's aware of the potential harm.\n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) format, usually, the community would look at intent and circumstances. The girlfriend's honesty was appropriate. The author's feelings are valid but the decision to leave might be seen as not being supportive enough. However, if he's genuinely not able to handle it and the relationship is causing both parties stress, maybe it's a mutual problem. But since the girlfriend is the one with the trauma, the onus isn't entirely on her. The author's choice to leave might be seen as wrong because he's choosing himself over her needs, especially when she's already in a vulnerable state. However, if he's not equipped to handle her trauma, maybe it's better for her to find someone who can support her better. But breaking up after she opened up could hurt her deeply.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. But the act of breaking up because of her past trauma, which she wasn't hiding and she confided in him, might be seen as him being in the wrong. He's choosing to leave despite loving her and acknowledging her amazing qualities. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's letting his discomfort override his commitment and support for her, which is a significant issue in a relationship. However, if he's truly unable to handle it, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But given the context, the expectation in a relationship is to work through such challenges together if possible. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
