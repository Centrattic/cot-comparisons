She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read the context again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a three-and-a-half-year relationship with his girlfriend. She had a reputation for being a tease, which he later found out was because she was religious and didn't want to have sex before marriage. Over time, he noticed she wasn't actually religious, just holding that belief for that one aspect. After two years of being together, she was ready for a sexual relationship but was very timid and it wasn't what he expected. Then, she told him about her past sexual abuse by family members, which is why she had issues with intimacy. Now, he feels conflicted\u2014on one hand, he wants to support her, but he's also feeling uncomfortable, thinking about the abuse, not wanting to have sex anymore, and questioning if he can handle the lifelong battle of her trauma.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The girlfriend's decision to open up about her past abuse is a significant step. She did it after attending therapy and feeling ready to share with her partner. She didn't want to burden the author before, which shows she cared about his feelings. The fact that she shared this means she trusted him, which is important. Now, the author is feeling conflicted. He's struggling with his emotions, guilt, and whether he's the right person to support her. \n\nHe's considering breaking up, partly because he doesn't want to be in a relationship where he's constantly thinking about the abuse and doesn't want to have sex anymore. But he also acknowledges her amazing qualities and his love for her. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong for him to feel this way? Well, people react differently to trauma and it's possible that he's not equipped to handle the emotional weight. However, walking away might be seen as abandoning her when she needs support. On the other hand, if he's not able to handle it and is genuinely afraid that it will affect their relationship negatively in the long term, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the key here is that she opened up to him, which is a vulnerable act, and he's responding with a desire to leave, which could hurt her deeply. \n\nBut the question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" In terms of responsibility, he's not at fault for his feelings. People have different capacities to handle trauma. However, acting on those feelings by breaking up might be seen as wrong because he chose to stay with her after she shared the abuse. By knowing her history, he's supposed to support her. Choosing to leave could be seen as a failure to support her, which could be considered wrong. However, if he's not able to support her and is being honest about his feelings, maybe it's a difficult but not entirely wrong decision.\n\nBut there's another angle. He was considering leaving even before she told him about the abuse. He had issues with her sexual hesitation and thought she wasn't attracted to him. Then, after the abuse came out, he felt even more conflicted. So maybe his initial discomfort was there before the abuse came into play. If he was already struggling with their sexual relationship, maybe the breaking point was just exacerbated by the abuse revelation, but he had existing issues.\n\nIs it fair to leave someone because of their trauma? That's a key point. If her trauma is affecting the relationship, but it's not her fault, and he's choosing to leave, that could be considered wrong because he's not taking responsibility to help her. However, if he's not able to handle it and is being honest, perhaps it's a difficult but not entirely wrong choice. However, the fact that he's considering leaving after she confided in him, which is a sign of trust, might mean that he's not honoring that trust, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nAlso, he mentioned that he's scared she'll know it's because of the abuse if he breaks up. That shows he's aware that it's a sensitive issue. So maybe he's being conscientious, but still conflicted.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, I think there's a strong argument that he's not. People can't be blamed for their feelings or their capacity to handle trauma. However, acting on those feelings by leaving could be seen as a failure of commitment. But commitment isn't about staying despite anything; it's about mutual effort. If he's not able to provide the support she needs, maybe it's not his fault. But he did choose to stay after she opened up, so maybe he's in a position where he should try to work through it. But if he's already lost interest in the relationship, then perhaps it's valid.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer is not straightforward. However, given that she opened up to him in good faith and he's considering leaving because of factors that were already present (sexual issues) plus the trauma, there's a possibility that he's not in the wrong, because people can't be forced to support someone through trauma if they're not capable. But if he's aware of her needs and is choosing not to meet them, maybe he is in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that he's not at fault for his feelings, but if he acts on them by breaking up, he might be considered in the wrong because he's not standing by her when she's vulnerable. However, the question is whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The person is considering leaving, but hasn't done so yet. The question is whether he's in the wrong in the situation as presented. Since he hasn't acted yet, and is seeking advice, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he hasn't taken the action yet. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, not whether he will be if he acts. Since he's in a state of confusion and hasn't decided yet, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's reflecting on his feelings and considering the consequences. Alternatively, maybe he's in the wrong for thinking about leaving after she trusted him with her trauma. But I think the answer is B.\n"
