She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for wanting to break up with his girlfriend after she revealed her past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend waited three years to tell the author about her past abuse. She used religion as an excuse initially, but in therapy, she realized the root of her issues and decided to be honest. The author is struggling with this new information. He's feeling conflicted\u2014on one hand, he loves her and supports her, but on the other, he's uncomfortable and can't see past the trauma. He's even considering breaking up because he doesn't want to trigger her or be part of her healing process if he's not sure he can handle it.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the girlfriend opened up about serious trauma, which is a huge step in any relationship. The author's reaction is a mix of guilt, discomfort, and fear about the future. He's worried about how he'd react if she brings up the abuse again and if he can support her long-term. He also mentions that he regrets telling her how he feels, which shows he cares about her feelings.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, when someone opens up about trauma, especially something as severe as childhood sexual abuse, it's a vulnerable moment. The girlfriend trusted him enough to share her story. The author's initial reaction (feeling like he wants to run, not wanting to hear about it) is a personal struggle, but the fact that he's questioning whether he's being a good partner by staying or leaving shows he's aware of the implications. However, breaking up because of her trauma, especially when he wasn't the cause of it, could be seen as abandoning her during a time she needs support. \n\nAlso, he's the one who brought up the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be A Total Asshole) question, indicating he's aware that walking away might be seen as selfish. His guilt after expressing his discomfort suggests he's not malicious but is conflicted. The girlfriend is now quiet and withdrawn after his response, which is a red flag. If he leaves now, it might hurt her deeply because she shared something so personal. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, staying with someone through their healing process requires empathy and commitment, even if it's challenging. The author's hesitation is understandable, but walking away without giving it a real try could be hurtful. However, if he's not emotionally capable of supporting her, staying might not be fair to either of them. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to be honest with himself, even if his reaction is flawed, it's more about personal struggle than intentional harm. \n\nBut the girlfriend was honest, and the author's response is causing her pain. If he leaves, it might be because he's unable to handle her trauma, which isn't her fault. However, the initial act of breaking up isn't his fault per se, but the context is that she trusted him enough to share her trauma. If he's not ready to handle it, maybe he's in a position where he's not the right support for her. However, the problem here is whether he's in the wrong. Since she chose to open up, and he's reacting in a way that's causing her further distress, maybe he's not handling it well. But considering the complexity of trauma and relationships, it's a tough spot. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he's abandoning his partner during a time when she needed support. Even if he's struggling, walking away without giving it a real effort could be seen as selfish. The fact that she trusted him to share such a deep secret and he's considering leaving might be hurtful and not supportive. However, the situation is nuanced. But based on the question, the answer is A.\n"
