She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she revealed her history of sexual abuse. He was initially disappointed when she didn't want to have sex because of her religious upbringing, but now he feels conflicted after finding out she was abused. He's struggling with his feelings, feeling like he can't be there for her, and considering breaking up because he's afraid he's not the right person for her. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if he's in the wrong. The key points here are her disclosure of abuse and his reaction. She opened up to him about something extremely traumatic, which is a huge step for anyone. He supported her in starting therapy, so he was on board with helping her work through issues. But upon learning the truth, he's feeling like he can't handle it. He's experiencing negative emotions and even says he wishes she hadn't told him. That's a tough place to be in.\n\nThe question is whether his feelings make him wrong. Well, people have different capacities for handling trauma in relationships. It's possible that his reaction is valid, but the way he's handling it might not be. He's considering breaking up, which could be seen as abandoning her during a vulnerable time. She's already been through a lot, and if he leaves, it might affect her trust in future relationships. However, if he's not emotionally equipped to support her, staying might not be healthy for either of them.\n\nBut here's the thing: he did support her through therapy and was okay with working on things when she mentioned the religious angle. Now that he knows the real reason, he's having second thoughts. This could be seen as a lack of commitment. However, it's also important to consider that he's human and is processing this information. His guilt after being honest with her shows he cares. The fact that he's seeking advice (WIBTA) suggests he's trying to do the right thing.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up because of her past trauma might be a form of invalidating her experience. It could be seen as the author not fully accepting her, even though he claims to love her. But if he's genuinely struggling to cope and can't provide the support she needs, maybe leaving isn't the worst outcome. However, the decision to break up after she opened up to him could hurt her deeply, especially since she didn't tell anyone else. \n\nIs it his fault for feeling overwhelmed? Maybe not entirely. But is he in the wrong for breaking up? Possibly, because he's reacting to her trauma rather than supporting her. Relationships require work, and sometimes people need to grow through challenges. If he's not willing to work through this, maybe he is in the wrong by not committing to help her heal. But if he's not capable of handling it, maybe there's some validity to his concerns. \n\nI think the main issue is that he's considering leaving because of her past, not because of any current actions she's taking. It's her trauma, not her choices now, that's causing the conflict. So, by wanting to leave over her history, he might be in the wrong. However, if he's not emotionally equipped, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The question is whether his reaction is justified. The answer would likely lean towards him being in the wrong because he's abandoning her at a time when she needs support the most. Even if he's struggling, walking away might be the wrong choice.\n"
