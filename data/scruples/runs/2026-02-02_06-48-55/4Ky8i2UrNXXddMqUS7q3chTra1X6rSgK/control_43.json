She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she confided in him about her past abuse. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had been in the relationship for three and a half years. She initially gave the excuse about being religious to explain her reluctance to have sex. Later, she revealed that her real reason was past sexual abuse. The author is conflicted because he feels she lied to him, is now uncomfortable in the relationship, and is considering breaking up because he can't handle the situation emotionally. He's worried about making her feel worse or causing her to avoid opening up again, but also feels he's not the right person to help her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend finally opened up about her trauma, the author is struggling with the revelation, feels she lied, and is considering ending the relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. The girlfriend's decision to confide in her partner is a significant step, showing trust. The author's reaction is based on his inability to cope with the situation, which is understandable given the trauma involved. However, leaving her after she's finally opened up could be seen as a betrayal of that trust. On the other hand, if he truly feels he can't support her and it's causing him distress, maybe staying would be harmful for both.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. If he breaks up because he can't handle the emotional burden, is that fair? It's important to recognize that the girlfriend's trauma isn't his fault, and he shouldn't be blamed for having a hard time. However, leaving her during a vulnerable time might be seen as abandoning her, especially if she's the only one she's told besides her therapist. That could be damaging to her mental health and trust in relationships.\n\nThe author also mentions that he feels she lied to him. She used a different excuse before revealing the truth, which could be seen as a form of deception, even if it was out of fear of rejection or stigma. But he supported her decision to go to therapy, and she was honest with him when she was ready. So, maybe the deception was out of necessity.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he has the right to his feelings, but he also has a responsibility to his partner's well-being. If he can't provide support, it might be in her best interest for him to step back, but he should approach this with empathy and care, ensuring she has other support systems in place. However, the way he's considering breaking up might be abrupt and hurtful without proper communication and support.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The answer might depend on how he handles the breakup. If he leaves her without providing support and understanding, that could be harmful. But if he's honest about his inability to cope and encourages her to seek other help, maybe it's a difficult but necessary decision. However, the initial problem is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to leave, given the circumstances. Since the girlfriend's actions (confiding in him) were not wrong, and the author's reaction is based on his own limitations rather than any wrongdoing by her, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But the ethical thing would be to handle the breakup with care, not in a way that retraumatizes her.\n\nThe question is a yes or no. The answer is either A (yes) or B (no). The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering that the author is struggling with his feelings and is considering breaking up due to his own emotional limits, while the girlfriend's actions were appropriate. Since the author is not at fault for having these feelings, but how he handles it is crucial. The initial question is whether he is in the wrong for breaking up. If he does break up, maybe it's a personal decision, but not necessarily wrong. However, the way he's thinking about it shows he's aware of the potential harm. So the answer might be B (no), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling the way he does, though he needs to handle it properly.\n"
