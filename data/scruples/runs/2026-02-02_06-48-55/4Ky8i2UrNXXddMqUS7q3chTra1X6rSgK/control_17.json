She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she revealed her past abuse. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guy is 20, his girlfriend 19. They've been together for over three years. Initially, she had a reputation of being a tease, but she explained it was because of her religious beliefs about not having sex before marriage. He was disappointed but stayed with her. Over time, he noticed she wasn't actually religious in other aspects. After about two years, she admitted she wanted to have sex but was struggling with her upbringing. They started a sexual relationship after 2.7 years, but he found it unsatisfactory and thought she might not be attracted to him. \n\nThen, after three years and three months, she reveals in therapy that she was sexually abused by family members as a child. She hadn't told anyone before, only her therapist and him. She used religion as an excuse to avoid discussing her trauma. Now, he's conflicted. He feels heartbroken, angry she lied about the religion, and uncomfortable with her trauma. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't think he can handle being with someone with such a traumatic past, even though he loves her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. She opened up to him about her trauma, which was a significant step for her. He admitted he felt differently about her after knowing the truth and expressed discomfort, which hurt her. He now wants to leave, possibly because he's not equipped to support her. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. But on the other hand, walking away after she reveals such a sensitive topic could be seen as abandoning her in her time of need. He also regrets saying he was uncomfortable and is conflicted about staying. \n\nLegally, there's no wrong; relationships are personal. Ethically, though, leaving someone after they've trusted you with their trauma might be seen as selfish. However, if he genuinely feels he can't support her and it's affecting the relationship's health, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the article mentions that she's the only one she can talk to besides her therapist. If he leaves, it could be damaging for her. \n\nHe's in a dilemma between his own feelings and her needs. The question is about his responsibility. Since she trusted him to share her trauma, and he's choosing to leave, it's a heavy decision. The community might see this as him being in the wrong because he's abandoning her after she opened up, but he's also under stress and maybe not ready to handle her trauma. \n\nBut the key is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A, he is wrong for leaving. If B, not wrong. The fact that he's considering breaking up despite loving her is a red flag. The article might argue that he's in the wrong because he's not supporting her through her healing. However, he's also honest about his limitations. It's a tough call. The article might lean towards A (he's wrong) because staying would be the supportive choice, but it's not a clear-cut right or wrong. But the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that she needed him to be there, and he's choosing to leave, which could be seen as abandoning her, the answer is likely A.\n"
