She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong if they break up with his girlfriend after she opens up about her past abuse. I need to figure out if the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The guy and his girlfriend have been together for around three and a half years. Initially, she had a reputation of being a tease, but she explained that it's because she's from a religious background and doesn't want to have sex before marriage. Later, he found out she's not really religious but used that as an excuse. After two years, she started a sexual relationship, but it wasn't satisfying for him. She was timid and it felt like a chore. Then, after she started therapy, she revealed that she was sexually abused as a child by family members, which is why she had issues with sex. He now feels conflicted because he doesn't want to be around her anymore, doesn't want to have sex, and is afraid she'll bring up her trauma. He's considering breaking up because he thinks it's a lifelong battle.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she opened up about her past abuse, which he didn't know before. He's struggling with how to handle it. He feels he's not the right person to support her. He's considering breaking up but is torn because he loves her and she's amazing otherwise. He also mentioned that he lied to her when he told her it didn't bother him when she talked about her past. She sensed his discomfort and stopped bringing it up, now being very quiet. He regrets being honest with her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong if he breaks up with her. The answer depends on whether breaking up is a justified response given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of support for someone with a history of abuse, it's important to be patient and understanding. Her opening up is a sign of trust, and he's struggling with his feelings about it. However, his reaction might be a normal initial response. But if he's not able to provide the support she needs and is considering leaving, that could be problematic. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is conflicted, but he's also recognizing his own limitations. He's not violent or abusive himself, but his feelings of discomfort and fear that she'll associate him with her past trauma might lead him to leave. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to work through challenges. If he's not capable of supporting her through her trauma and can't see a future where he can, then staying might not be healthy for either of them. However, walking away immediately after she opens up could be seen as abandoning her in her time of need. \n\nBut the question is not about whether breaking up is the best choice, but if the author is in the wrong. If breaking up is the result of him not being able to handle her trauma and choosing to leave, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if he's making an informed decision after realizing he can't support her, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nBut considering that he's the only one she's told besides her therapist, and she trusted him, leaving might hurt her more. Also, he admitted to lying to her to avoid hurting her feelings, which shows he's aware of his impact. The fact that he's seeking advice suggests he's trying to make the right decision. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, once someone opens up about trauma, the partner's reaction is crucial. Walking away could be seen as a failure to support her. However, if he's genuinely not capable of handling it, it's a difficult situation. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the breakup is based on her trauma or other factors. Since the author is considering leaving primarily because of her trauma and his inability to cope, that could be seen as the wrong choice. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's choosing to leave her when she's vulnerable and needs support. However, if he's making a decision out of self-awareness that he can't be the right support, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But generally, in such situations, staying and trying to work through it is expected unless there's abuse or danger. Since there's no indication of that, he might be in the wrong by leaving. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. The situation is complex. He has valid feelings but also a responsibility to support her. If he breaks up with her, he's abandoning her, which is wrong. However, he's also considering his own well-being. The key here is that he's not abusive, but his decision to leave is based on her trauma. Typically, in such cases, the partner is expected to stay and support unless there's a good reason. So the answer is likely A.\n"
