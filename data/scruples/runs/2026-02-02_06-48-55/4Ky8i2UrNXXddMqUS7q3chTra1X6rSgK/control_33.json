She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she told him about her past abuse. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for over three years. The girlfriend kept the abuse secret, using religion as an excuse for not having sex. Then, after starting a sexual relationship, the author felt the intimacy wasn't fulfilling. The girlfriend opened up about her abuse in therapy and decided to tell him. The author is now conflicted: he feels hurt, angry, and uncomfortable, and is considering breaking up because he doesn't think he can handle her trauma, even though he loves her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's decision to share her trauma was a significant step, trusting the author. The author's reaction includes feeling she lied, discomfort, and a loss of interest in intimacy. The question is whether his reaction makes him in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is reacting to a traumatic revelation. It's possible that his feelings are valid as a normal stress response. But on the other hand, he's considering breaking up because he can't handle her trauma, which might be seen as abandoning her when she needs support. The girlfriend might feel worse if he leaves, especially since this was a secret she kept for a long time.\n\nThe author mentions he doesn't want to be angry but is, and he feels she lied. However, she had her reasons for not telling him earlier\u2014using religion as a protective shield. Her therapist encouraged her to open up, and she did so in a moment of trust. If the author can't support her through this, even though he loves her, that raises questions about his commitment. \n\nAlso, the author's discomfort with her trauma leading to a desire to end the relationship might indicate that he's prioritizing his own emotional state over her needs. The girlfriend is dealing with PTSD, which requires a supportive partner. Walking away could make her feel blamed or unsupported, which isn't ideal. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the author's mental health. If he's truly unable to cope with this aspect of her life, maybe it's not fair to either of them to stay in a relationship that causes him significant distress. But given the time they've been together and the fact that she opened up in good faith, breaking up might be seen as selfish or not considering her vulnerability.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The core issue is his reaction to her trauma and the decision to break up. Society often expects partners to support each other through tough times, so if he can't do that, he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if his feelings are genuine and he can't overcome them, it's a hard but honest decision. But given the circumstances, especially her trusting him with such a heavy secret, leaving might be seen as abandoning her, making him at fault. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction, while understandable, is leading him to consider leaving when she needed support. The ethical choice would be to stay and work through it, even if it's difficult. Walking away in this context could be seen as not fulfilling his role as a supportive partner.\n"
