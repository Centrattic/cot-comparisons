She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she revealed her past abuse. The story is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend, who is 19, has been open about her religious beliefs regarding sex before marriage, which the author initially thought was the reason she wasn't having sex. But later, after some time, she revealed that her reluctance was due to past sexual abuse. The author is now feeling conflicted about staying in the relationship because he's upset about her lying (or not telling him the truth) and the emotional impact of her trauma. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't know how to handle the situation and is afraid of the abuse coming up in their interactions, including sex. He's torn between loving her and feeling unable to support her anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The girlfriend had a valid reason for not disclosing her abuse earlier\u2014she was afraid to tell anyone and used religion as a cover because it's a sensitive topic. She only told her therapist and now the author. This could be seen as a brave step towards healing, trusting someone enough to share such a personal and traumatic experience.\n\n2. The author's reaction is a mix of guilt, discomfort, and wanting to leave. He acknowledges her trauma but feels overwhelmed. His feelings of anger towards her for not being honest earlier, even though she had a good reason, might not be justified. The author is also struggling with his own feelings about intimacy now that he knows about her past.\n\n3. The question is whether breaking up is the right decision. From a moral standpoint, leaving someone after they've confided in you about such a traumatic experience could be seen as selfish or unfair, especially if they were trying to seek support. However, if the author feels he can't provide the support she needs and is causing her emotional distress by leaving, maybe it's a complex situation.\n\nThe author is in a difficult position. On one hand, he's not to blame for having an emotional reaction to such a shocking revelation. On the other hand, walking away might be seen as abandoning someone in need of support. The fact that he's feeling guilt after she cried and apologized might indicate that he's aware his reaction could be hurtful. Also, he's considering her well-being by not wanting to be with someone who's \"damaged\" but that's a bit of a problematic perspective because trauma doesn't define a person's worth.\n\nThe girlfriend's therapist is part of the picture, so maybe she's working through this, and the author needs to decide whether he can be part of her healing process. The initial decision to break up might be premature if he hasn't sought ways to support her, like therapy for both of them or education on how to handle her PTSD.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling conflicted, but choosing to end the relationship might be a selfish decision that doesn't consider her needs. However, if he truly can't handle the emotional burden and it's causing her distress, maybe it's for the best, but that's a heavy call. The key here is whether he's being selfish versus realistic about his ability to support her. Since he's already feeling guilt and conflict, staying might require effort from both sides. But given the context, the author is in a tough spot where his reaction is a mix of valid emotions and maybe not fully understanding the depth of her trauma. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's walking away after she trusted him with her trauma, but there's nuance here. However, the user thinks he is in the wrong, so I need to consider that.\n"
