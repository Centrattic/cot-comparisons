She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She had a reputation for being a tease, but he found out later that it was because she was raised religious and didn't want to have sex before marriage. However, over time, he noticed she wasn't actually religious, just held onto that belief regarding sex. After two years and seven months, she became ready for a sexual relationship, but their sex life wasn't what he expected\u2014she was timid, only doing certain positions, and it seemed like a chore. He mentioned enjoying being aggressive, which she didn't like. Then, after three years and three months, she told him about her past sexual abuse by family members as a child. She used religion as an excuse before because she didn't want to share that secret. Now, he's feeling conflicted: he wants to support her but is struggling with the new information, feeling she lied to him, and he can't have sex with her anymore without fearing she'll think of her abusers. He's considering breaking up, thinking he's not the right person for someone so \"damaged,\" even though he loves her a lot. He's scared that if he breaks up, she'll be scared to open up again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The girlfriend had a traumatic past and used religion as a shield because she didn't want to share her abuse. When she finally did, it was a big emotional moment. The author had been patient for three years, but now he's reconsidering the relationship. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's dealing with a lot of emotions. He feels lied to because she used religion as an excuse instead of her trauma. He's also struggling with the fact that their sex life isn't what he wanted, and now he's worried about triggering her past trauma during intimacy. He loves her but feels overwhelmed. \n\nBut from the girlfriend's side, she's dealing with PTSD from sexual abuse. She's taken a big step by confiding in him, trusting him. She might be vulnerable and in need of support. The fact that he's now pulling away after she opened up could be hurtful. She might feel that her trust was misplaced. \n\nThe key points here are consent, support, and the author's reaction. The girlfriend was not \"damaged\" but had a legitimate trauma. The author initially supported her therapy, but now he's considering leaving because he can't handle the emotional burden. Is that his right? \n\nIn relationships, partners are expected to support each other through challenges. However, if one partner is genuinely unable to cope with the other's trauma, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. But the author is also reacting to the fact that she kept the secret for so long, which might have been a protective mechanism. She used religion as an excuse because she couldn't tell him earlier. \n\nThe author's reaction might be seen as a normal stress response. It's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed by a partner's trauma. However, the way he responds (withdrawing, not wanting to engage, possibly breaking up) could be harmful if it abandons her when she needs support. But if he's not emotionally equipped to handle it, maybe he's being honest with himself. \n\nIs it his fault for not being able to handle this? Or is he being selfish? The line between self-preservation and abandonment can be thin. \n\nHe did support her therapy, which shows he cared. But when the truth came out, his feelings changed. He's conflicted but also aware of his limitations. The question is whether he's in the wrong for recognizing that he can't be the right support for her.\n\nIn terms of ethics, staying in a relationship where you can't support your partner's needs might be harmful. Leaving could be seen as a form of self-care, but also as abandonment. However, the author is trying to be honest about his feelings, even though it's painful. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether his feelings are valid. If he's not able to adjust and find ways to support her, then leaving might be the responsible choice. But if he could work through these feelings, maybe staying is better. \n\nThe key here is that the author is considering breaking up not because of her trauma itself but because of the emotional impact it's having on him. That might be a conflict of interest. He's prioritizing his own comfort over her needs, which could be seen as selfish. However, if he's truly unable to provide the support she needs, then it's a hard decision. \n\nBut given that he's already considering staying if it's a \"normal\" reaction, and leaving if he's the \"asshole,\" the question is about societal judgment. In many cases, supporting a partner through trauma is seen as a responsibility, so if he can't do that, he might be in the wrong. However, no one is obligated to stay in a relationship that's causing them significant stress, especially if they're not equipped to handle it. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author is in a difficult situation, but if he leaves, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his reasons are valid. If he's leaving because he can't handle the emotional load, that might be seen as a personal failing rather than being in the wrong per se. However, if he's not giving it enough time or not making an effort to adapt, then he might be. \n\nIn this case, the author is already feeling conflicted and is seeking advice. The fact that he's aware of his feelings and the impact on his partner shows some level of responsibility. But the act of breaking up could be seen as wrong if it's due to personal inconvenience rather than genuine incompatibility. \n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's choosing to leave based on his own discomfort rather than supporting her through her trauma. However, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid struggles. But from a societal perspective, staying and trying to work through it would be the expected response, hence he's in the wrong for considering leaving.\n"
