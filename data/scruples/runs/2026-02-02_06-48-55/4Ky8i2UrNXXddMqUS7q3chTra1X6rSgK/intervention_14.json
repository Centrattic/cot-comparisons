She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe guy (20M) is in a 3-year and 3-month relationship with his girlfriend (19F). She's dealing with the aftermath of childhood sexual abuse, which she recently revealed to him after starting therapy. He's struggling with how to handle this, feels conflicted, and is considering ending the relationship. The main question is whether he's in the wrong if he breaks up with her because of her past abuse disclosure.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. She was abused as a child by family members, which is a severe trauma. She used religion as an excuse for not engaging in sex, but that was a cover for her PTSD from the abuse. She only told him because of therapy, and she trusted him enough to share such a sensitive topic. This shows a significant level of vulnerability and trust on her part.\n\nNow, the guy's reaction is mixed. He's empathetic, acknowledging her pain and the fact that it wasn't her fault. However, he's also feeling overwhelmed. He's having trouble with the sexual aspect of the relationship, finding her timidity and the positions they engage in problematic. He's also mentioned not wanting to have sex anymore because he fears she might be thinking of her abusers during intimacy. That's a valid concern, as intimacy can be challenging after trauma.\n\nHe's feeling conflicted between wanting to support her and his personal discomfort. He's also thinking about his own feelings of not being the right partner for someone with such a difficult past. The key here is whether his decision to break up is justified.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, supporting a partner through trauma requires patience, understanding, and sometimes professional help. The guy's immediate reaction is to consider leaving, which might be a self-protective response or a sign of his own inability to handle the stress. However, walking away because someone has a traumatic past could be seen as insensitive. It's important to recognize that her trauma isn't her fault and that she's already facing immense challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy is also human, and his feelings are real. He might not know how to support her and is struggling with his own emotions. The fact that he's honest with her about his discomfort shows some level of integrity, even if it's painful. But the way he's processing this\u2014considering breaking up\u2014raises ethical questions. Is it fair to her to end the relationship because of her past, especially when he was aware of her religious stance beforehand and continued the relationship?\n\nThe girl's trust in him is crucial. By breaking up, he might be causing her additional emotional harm, especially since she opened up to him in a vulnerable state. The fact that she hasn't brought up the abuse since he expressed discomfort suggests she's hurt and possibly withdrawing further, which could hinder her recovery.\n\nIt's also worth considering that he might not have the necessary tools to support her. Maybe he needs to seek counseling for himself to better understand how to navigate this situation. However, deciding to leave because he's overwhelmed might not be the right approach. Relationships take work, especially when dealing with trauma, and both partners need to be committed to that process.\n\nIn conclusion, while the guy has valid feelings, walking away because of her past trauma might make him complicit in the emotional harm she's already experienced. Supporting her through this, even if it's difficult, would be more compassionate. His decision to break up could be seen as prioritizing his own discomfort over her well-being, which would place him in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
