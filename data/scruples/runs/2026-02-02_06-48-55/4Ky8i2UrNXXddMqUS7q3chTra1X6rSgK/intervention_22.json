She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together for over three years. Initially, she had a reputation as a tease, but she explained it was because of her religious background, which made her not want to have sex before marriage. He was disappointed but stayed with her. Later, he noticed she wasn't actually very religious and was frustrated she used religion as an excuse for not being sexual. Then, after 3 years, she was ready for a sexual relationship, but he found it unsatisfying and thought she wasn't attracted to him. \n\nNow, after she starts therapy, she reveals she was sexually abused as a child. She tells him this is why she had issues with intimacy, using religion as an excuse. He's struggling with the revelation. He feels she lied to him, is now thinking about breaking up because he doesn't know how to help her, is scared of her bringing up the abuse during sex, and feels he's the only one she can talk to. He's conflicted between staying with her because he loves her and wants to support her, but also feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The girlfriend was keeping her abuse secret because of trauma, which is understandable. She told the author to seek help, showing trust. The author is now considering breaking up because he's uncomfortable and doesn't know how to handle it. \n\nFrom an empathy standpoint, supporting a partner through trauma is a significant commitment. The author's reaction might stem from his own limitations in handling such a situation. However, leaving someone during their recovery process could be seen as abandoning them when they need support the most. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. He might feel he's not the right person to help her, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong for feeling that way. However, acting on those feelings by breaking up might be harmful, especially if the primary reason is his inability to cope rather than her actions. \n\nHe also mentioned that after confessing, she became quiet and cried, and he regrets being honest about his discomfort. This shows he's aware of the potential harm. The question is whether his decision to break up is justified. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual support are key. If one partner is struggling with their own trauma and the other is unable to provide the necessary support, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. However, the author hasn't given her a chance to work through it together. He's thinking about leaving because he's scared of the future, not because she's doing anything wrong now. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he had discussed his feelings and they both decided it's not working, that's different. However, he's considering breaking up unilaterally. In that case, maybe he is in the wrong because he's not giving her a chance to address the issue and because he's prioritizing his own discomfort over her well-being. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's trauma is not her fault, and the author's reaction shouldn't punish her for something beyond her control. If he can't support her through this, maybe he is not the right partner for her. However, walking away after she opened up to him could be seen as a betrayal of the trust she placed in him. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong because he's not fully supporting his partner during a critical time and is letting his own limitations affect their relationship instead of seeking ways to help her. His feelings are valid, but his decision to potentially break up is harmful and dismissive of her needs.\n"
