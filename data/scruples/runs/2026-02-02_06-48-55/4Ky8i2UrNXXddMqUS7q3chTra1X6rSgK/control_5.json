She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend breaking up with his girlfriend after she reveals a history of sexual abuse. The key points here are the context of her disclosure, the reasons behind the breakup, and the emotional dynamics at play.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend opened up about her past abuse after being in a three-year relationship. She initially used religion as a reason for not being sexual, but later admitted that it was actually due to trauma from abuse. This is a significant revelation, especially because she had kept it secret for so long. The author of the post is now struggling with the knowledge and considering breaking up because he can't handle the emotional weight and his feelings about being in a relationship with someone who has such trauma.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The girlfriend disclosed her trauma, which is a deeply personal and vulnerable act. The author is feeling overwhelmed, which is somewhat understandable, but the question is whether his reaction is justified. He's considering breaking up because he's uncomfortable with her history and the impact it has on their sex life and his ability to support her. However, he also acknowledges that she's amazing and that he loves her.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's decision to break up is a valid response. The girlfriend's trauma is not her fault, and it's a part of her life that she's working through with therapy. The author is reacting to a situation that he didn't cause. Breaking up because of her past trauma could be seen as a failure to support her during a vulnerable time. It might be considered inconsiderate or even selfish, as it's her history, not his. However, it's also important to note that he's struggling with his own feelings and might not be equipped to handle the emotional demands of supporting someone with such deep trauma.\n\nAnother angle is the aspect of trust and communication. She took a significant risk by sharing her past, and his reaction might have hurt her and made her less likely to open up in the future. This could affect her healing process. The author's feelings are valid, but acting on them by breaking up could be seen as not taking responsibility for his part in the relationship's challenges. However, he's also trying to be honest about his feelings, which is important in a healthy relationship.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author is in the wrong for not being able to handle the situation. He might genuinely feel that he's not the right person to support her, which is a valid realization. But the way he's approaching the breakup, considering her vulnerability, could be problematic. If he breaks up with her immediately after her disclosure, it might be seen as abandoning her during a critical time. However, if he's not capable of providing the necessary support, maybe it's better for both of them in the long run. But the problem is that the trauma she's facing is not something she chose, and the breakup is a reaction to her past rather than her current actions.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for having feelings or for deciding that he can't support her. However, the way he's processing this without considering the impact on her mental health could be problematic. The fact that she hasn't told anyone else and trusts him enough to share this means that his reaction could damage that trust. It's a complex situation where both people have valid emotions, but the decision to break up might be seen as a failure to meet the expectations of support in a relationship, especially after she made herself vulnerable.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's decision might be influenced by his own discomfort rather than her actions. Since the trauma is not her fault and she's seeking help, the author's reaction of wanting to leave could be seen as invalidating her experiences. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for prioritizing his own feelings over her needs and the commitment he's made. However, if he's not able to provide the support she needs, it's a difficult situation. Still, the fact that he's struggling with his feelings after she opened up suggests that he's not in the wrong entirely, but his potential breakup might be the wrong move.\n"
