She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She recently opened up to him about her past sexual abuse by family members, which she had kept secret, using religion as an excuse for her reluctance to be sexual. Now, he's feeling conflicted. He's upset, doesn't want to be around her as much, is having trouble with intimacy, and is considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend did something brave by sharing such a traumatic experience. She put her trust in him, which is a significant part of a relationship. The author is struggling with how to handle this. He's feeling a mix of emotions, including anger at the lies (though he now understands her reasons), discomfort during intimacy, and fear that they might not be compatible long-term because of her trauma.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, if someone shares a deeply personal and traumatic secret, expecting support, and the partner reacts with withdrawal or considering leaving, that could be seen as not being supportive. However, the author is also dealing with his own feelings and fears. He's worried about not being able to help her, or that their relationship might not work because of her trauma. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual support. She didn't force him to stay; he chose to be in the relationship. His decision to leave now, after she opened up, could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable time. However, if he feels he can't support her, maybe it's not fair to her to stay if he's not capable of being there for her. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up.\n\nOn one hand, breaking up after such a revelation might be seen as insensitive, especially if she was already struggling with depression and needed support. On the other hand, if he's not emotionally equipped to handle her trauma and their relationship is suffering, maybe it's a difficult but honest decision. However, walking away right after she reveals such a big secret could be seen as a failure to support her, which is a big part of a healthy relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that he did tell her his discomfort, which led to her crying and him feeling guilty, shows that he's conflicted. The question is whether his decision to break up is wrong. If he chooses to leave, he's prioritizing his own feelings over her need for support. But if he stays and is unhappy, that's also not ideal for either of them. The problem is that he's the one who initiated contact to ask if he's in the wrong. The community might look at this as him not taking responsibility for his part in the relationship and not being supportive when it's needed most.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one partner has experienced trauma, support and understanding are crucial. The author's initial reaction is common\u2014people often don't know how to handle such situations. But choosing to leave after she opened up could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Even if he's not an asshole, he might be in the wrong for not being there for her when she needed him. However, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's not capable of providing the support she needs, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong for breaking up.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because breaking up after someone opens up about such a traumatic experience could be seen as not being supportive and abandoning her in her time of need. Even if he's conflicted, the act of leaving might be considered wrong because it's not taking responsibility and supporting his partner through her trauma.\n"
