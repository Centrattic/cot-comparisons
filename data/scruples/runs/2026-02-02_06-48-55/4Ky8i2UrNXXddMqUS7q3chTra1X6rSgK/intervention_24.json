She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that he's breaking up with his girlfriend after she opened up about her past abuse. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a history of sexual abuse by family members, which she only revealed in therapy. She used religion as an excuse for not having sex before, but it was actually due to her trauma. Now, after she told him, he's feeling conflicted. He's upset that she lied about it, but he also acknowledges that she had a good reason. He's struggling with the fact that he can't be around her without thinking about the abuse, and he's afraid of triggering her or being associated with those memories. He wants to support her but feels he's not the right person for her because of his negative reactions.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about the moral aspects here. She opened up about something incredibly personal and traumatic. For someone to share such a deep, painful part of their past is a huge act of trust. The author, while initially supportive, is now struggling with his own feelings. He's feeling anger and discomfort, which is understandable, but he's also aware that his reaction might be normal. The key here is whether his decision to break up is justified given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, he's not being cruel or abusive. He's trying to be honest about his feelings and wants to support her. He's not blaming her for the abuse, which was not her fault. He's acknowledging her strength in coming forward. But on the other hand, he's considering leaving because his ability to cope with her trauma is limited. That raises ethical concerns. Is it fair for him to leave because he can't handle the emotional burden of being with someone who has such trauma? It's a tough situation.\n\nThe girlfriend is in therapy, which is a positive step, but she's now feeling hurt because he admitted discomfort. She's withdrawn, and he's worried about her reaction if they break up. Breaking up might prevent future strain on both of them, but it could also be devastating for her. The question is whether his decision is selfish or necessary for his own well-being.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He tried to communicate his feelings, which she took as a rejection. He's now in a position where he can't ignore his feelings. However, the fact that he's the only one she's shared this with besides her therapist adds another layer. By leaving, he might be causing her to feel like she can't trust others, which could hinder her healing.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He's not malicious, but he's prioritizing his own emotional state over her need for support. In a healthy relationship, both partners work through challenges. However, if one person is consistently unable to cope with the other's issues, maybe it's not fair to stay. But the moral responsibility here is complex. He's in a tough spot where his intentions are good, but the outcome might be harmful for her. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether his feelings are a valid reason to leave or if he should stay and support her through it. Since he still loves her and recognizes her amazing qualities, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if staying is going to cause more harm than good, perhaps it's better for him to leave. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's being honest and considering her well-being, even if it means parting ways, it's a difficult decision but not necessarily wrong. However, if he's being selfish, then yes. The text suggests he's trying to balance both their needs. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
