She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original situation is in the wrong if they break up with their girlfriend after she reveals her history of sexual abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend withheld information about her past abuse, using religion as an excuse instead. Now that she's shared her trauma, the author is struggling with how to handle this. He admits to feeling anger, discomfort, and a loss of interest in intimacy. He's also worried about being the right partner for someone with such a history. The question is whether he's in the wrong if he decides to break up.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the girlfriend's decision to open up was a significant act of trust. The author's reaction is important here. He's feeling hurt because she lied about her reasons for abstinence, but lying to protect her trauma isn't something he can hold against her. The abuse isn't her fault, and she was doing her best with the coping mechanisms she had. However, the author's feelings are valid as well. He's experiencing difficulty adjusting to this new information and is struggling with his own emotions, which is a common reaction to such revelations.\n\nBut the critical factor is whether breaking up is the right decision. If he's considering leaving because he can't support her through her healing, that could be seen as abandoning her in a time of need. However, if he's not able to emotionally handle the situation and is causing her more distress by staying, that's a problem. The fact that he's seeking advice and reflecting on his feelings suggests he's trying to do the right thing, but the decision isn't straightforward.\n\nThe girlfriend is in therapy, which is a positive step. The author needs to assess whether he can provide the support she needs. If he's feeling resentment or can't handle the emotional load, he might be putting her through more stress by staying. However, walking away could also be seen as self-serving, prioritizing his own comfort over her well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's reaction is influenced by his own expectations and the fact that he didn't know the full story for the duration of the relationship. The girlfriend's decision to disclose after starting therapy was a responsible move. The author now has to decide if he can adapt and support her, which is a mature approach. If he chooses to stay, he might need to work on his own feelings and seek couples counseling. If he leaves, it's important to do so respectfully and ensure she continues to receive support through her therapist.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he leaves because he can't handle the situation and isn't making efforts to adjust, that's a problem. But if he decides to stay without being ready, that could also harm both of them. The answer hinges on whether he acts out of selfishness or genuine inability to support her. The original question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. Given the context, if he leaves, he might be seen as in the wrong because he's not supporting someone who's vulnerable. However, if he's truly unable to handle it and is causing her harm by staying, that's a different scenario. The situation is complex, but the initial decision to leave could be viewed as not being in the wrong if he's being honest about his inability to cope. However, the more responsible choice is to stay and work through it unless there's a compelling reason not to. The fact that he's conflicted and seeking advice suggests he's trying to do the right thing, but the act of leaving might still be seen as wrong if it's not for his own well-being but hers. But since he's the one struggling, maybe it's not entirely his fault. This is tricky. I need to weigh the options carefully.\n"
