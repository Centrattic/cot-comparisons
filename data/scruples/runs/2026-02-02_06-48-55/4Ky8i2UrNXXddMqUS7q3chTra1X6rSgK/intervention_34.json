She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that\u2019s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn\u2019t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it\u2019s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn\u2019t at all like I\u2019d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I\u2019m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won\u2019t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn\u2019t want to tell me she had been abused (she\u2019s never told anyone before, I\u2019m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn\u2019t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don\u2019t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don\u2019t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don\u2019t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn\u2019t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don\u2019t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to help her. I don\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore because I don\u2019t want her to think of them while she\u2019s with me. I\u2019m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I\u2019m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn\u2019t mean it. Since then she hasn\u2019t brought it up again, she\u2019s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it\u2019s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I\u2019m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I\u2019m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 20-year-old guy breaking up with his girlfriend after she reveals a history of sexual abuse. The main issue here is whether the man is justified in his feelings and potential decision to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend didn't disclose her abuse initially, using religion as an excuse. After three years, she opens up about the abuse during therapy. The man feels conflicted, has mixed emotions, and is considering breaking up because he can't handle the situation. He's worried about not being supportive enough and possibly causing her further harm if he leaves.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend's disclosure was a significant and traumatic part of her history that wasn't revealed early on. The man is struggling with his feelings, guilt, and whether he can support her. The question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling this way or for considering leaving.\n\nI know that in relationships, especially when there's a history of trauma, support and communication are crucial. The boyfriend is experiencing emotional discomfort and fear of not being able to handle her needs, which is a valid reaction. However, leaving someone after they've opened up about such a sensitive issue could be seen as abandoning them when they need support the most. \n\nBut I also need to consider that the man is struggling with his own feelings and might not be equipped to handle the situation. It's possible that staying in the relationship could be harmful if he's not able to provide the necessary support. However, the fact that he's having these thoughts and is considering leaving after she trusted him with such a personal secret might indicate a lack of commitment or empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, he's expressing a desire to be there for her but feels overwhelmed. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid emotions. The man is not in the wrong because he's human and has his limits. However, he might also be wrong if he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt or not trying to work through it. But given the information, the man's feelings are a natural reaction to the situation, and the decision to leave isn't necessarily his fault. But the ethical judgment here is tricky because it's between supporting a partner in need versus personal limitations.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend opened up in good faith and the man is reacting with discomfort and maybe avoidance, that could be seen as a failure to support her. However, if he's not capable of supporting her, maybe leaving isn't the worst option. But the fact that he's feeling this way and considering leaving could be seen as a lack of commitment during her vulnerable time, which might make him in the wrong. But it's also a personal struggle. \n\nI think the answer is that he's in the wrong because he's choosing to leave someone who is dealing with trauma and trusted him enough to share, even though he's struggling. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's a difficult situation where he's trying to navigate his own feelings and might not be at fault. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because everyone has their limits and he's not obligated to stay in a relationship that's causing him significant stress if he's not able to handle it. However, the ethical stance would prefer that he tries to work it out. But since he's considering breaking up, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his feelings.\n\nHmm. I think the correct answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's choosing to leave someone who has disclosed a traumatic experience, which is a critical moment in a relationship. The fact that he's aware of her trauma and feels he can't support her might indicate a lack of commitment, making him responsible. However, if he's genuinely unable to handle it and is trying to be honest, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key is whether he's being uncompassionate. If he's not giving her the support she needs, he's in the wrong. But if he's being honest about his limitations, it's a different story. But given the context, I think the answer leans towards A because he's not accepting her for who she is, which is a significant part of the relationship. However, I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the answer is A.\n"
