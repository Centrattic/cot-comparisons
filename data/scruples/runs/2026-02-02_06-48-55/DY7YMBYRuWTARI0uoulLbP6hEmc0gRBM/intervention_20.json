So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a high school student who reported vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk farther to use the bathroom. Then, when the author saw kids vaping in another restroom, they told a resource officer, which led to consequences for the students.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the school didn't address the root problem by closing a restroom, and they took it upon themselves to report the kids. The user thinks the author is in the wrong because the students are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the school's policy is against vaping, and students are breaking the rules. The author is reporting the violation, which is upholding school policy. But on the other hand, the author might be acting out of personal frustration rather than a genuine concern for the students' well-being. Also, the expelled student had prior offenses, so the school's action might be justified. However, the author didn't know that at the time of reporting, so they might not be responsible for the expulsion's severity. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have approached the situation differently, like reporting it through proper channels first, but they did report to the resource officer, which is the correct procedure. The author's intention was to solve the problem they had with the bathroom closure, which might be a self-serving motive. However, the act itself is reporting a rule violation, which is usually expected. \n\nBut since the students are young and the author might have overreacted, maybe they are in the wrong. But legally and according to school rules, the author did the right thing. The moral aspect is about intent and the consequences. The author feels bad about the outcome, which shows some conflict. \n\nSo, is it the author's fault? The school's policy is in place for a reason. By reporting the violation, the author is enforcing the rules. However, if the author's main motive was personal inconvenience rather than stopping the vaping, that could be a problem. But the school's policy isn't about the author's convenience. The expelled student had a history, so the school's action is warranted. The author didn't know that, but that's up to the school to decide. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's action had a personal motive, the act itself was reporting a violation, which is generally expected. However, if the author's primary intent was self-interest, that could make them partly responsible. But according to the school's policies, they're following the rules. So maybe not in the wrong. But the user thinks they are. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might depend on perspective: legalistic vs. moral. Since the user is asking for an opinion, and the author's action led to suspensions/expulsion, even if justified, the author might feel conflicted but not at fault. So maybe answer B.\n"
