So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The school closed a bathroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because now they have to walk far to another bathroom. Then, they saw a group of students vaping in the other bathroom and told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they were all freshmen, 14-15 years old.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the possible angles. On one hand, the author reported a violation of school rules. Vaping in school is against the rules, and the students were doing it in a restroom, which is a restricted area. The school's policy might require reporting such incidents. So, the author could argue they were doing the right thing by upholding rules.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being a tattletale. The school's initial response was to close the bathroom instead of addressing the root issue. The author might have felt resentful about the inconvenience and took it out by snitching on others. Also, considering the age of the students, they might not have fully understood the consequences. But the author knew about the vaping and chose to report, possibly for personal reasons like frustration with the bathroom closure.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the school's policy is clear that vaping is prohibited, then reporting it might be their responsibility. However, if the author's motivation was more about personal inconvenience than genuine concern for the rules, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the outcome was severe (expulsion), which might make the author question their role in that consequence. \n\nBut from a legal and policy standpoint, the school has the authority to enforce rules, and students are expected to follow them. The author isn't necessarily at fault for reporting a violation. The school's decision to expel might be their responsibility, not the reporter's. However, the moral aspect is tricky. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the system to get back at the school for closing the bathroom. But if they truly believed they were doing the right thing by reporting, maybe they aren't in the wrong.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they reported a policy violation. However, their personal motive (frustration with the school's decision) complicates things. But the action itself\u2014reporting illegal activity\u2014might be justified regardless of motive. So answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
