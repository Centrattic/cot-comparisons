So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, when they found another group vaping, they told the school resource officer, which led to consequences. The author feels bad because the kids were young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's actions. They didn't just report once but actively went in and busted them. The school's policy is against vaping, so reporting it isn't inherently wrong. But the author's motivation might matter. They were annoyed about the inconvenience of using another restroom, so maybe they had a personal stake here. But is that a valid reason to report others?\n\nAlso, the kids were freshmen, 14-15 years old. The author feels bad because they might not understand the consequences. But the school is enforcing rules regardless of age. If the students were breaking the rules, the school has to take action. So the author didn't cause the expulsion; the school did because of repeated violations.\n\nBut was it right for the author to report them? If the school is already aware of the problem and has policies in place, maybe the author is just following rules. However, if the author is using this as a way to get back at the school for closing the restroom, that could be problematic. The line between doing the right thing and seeking revenge is a bit fuzzy here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is reporting illegal activity. On the other hand, their personal frustration might have influenced their decision. Also, leading a \"bust\" seems like going above and beyond, which might be seen as aggressive. But in a school setting, students are supposed to report violations. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The consequences were the school's decision, not the author's. The author followed the rules, even if the outcome feels harsh. The author's intention might be a factor, but unless there was malicious intent, they're probably not wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). They reported a violation, and the school acted according to their policies. The author's frustration doesn't make the action wrong. However, some might argue that they should have handled it differently, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n"
