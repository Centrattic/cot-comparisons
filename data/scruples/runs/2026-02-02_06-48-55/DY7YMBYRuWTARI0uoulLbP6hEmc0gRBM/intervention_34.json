So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a student who tattled on other students vaping, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids were freshmen, young, and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The school shut down a restroom because students were vaping there. The author found a group of students vaping in the other restroom and told the resource officer. The result was multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just the students breaking school rules for peer approval.\n\nNow, the ethical aspect. The author saw rule-breaking and reported it. On one hand, they're following the rules and holding others accountable. But on the other hand, the consequences were severe for teenagers who might not fully understand the repercussions. The author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the initial issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, by reporting the violation, they're doing what's expected. However, maybe they should have considered if the school's approach was fair or if there was a middle ground. But the school's job is to enforce rules, so perhaps the author isn't wrong for reporting. The freshmen's actions are their own responsibility, but the author's action led to harsh consequences. But the author wasn't the one deciding the punishment; that's up to the school. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have had the right to report, but the emotional impact on younger students is a concern. However, the school's policies are in place for a reason. The author didn't use excessive force or lie; they observed and reported. So maybe they're not in the wrong. But the fact that they targeted younger students and caused their expulsion might make some see it as wrong. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules consistently. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author acted within the school's policies. If the school's rules state that vaping is a violation and the resource officer handles it, then the author is correct in reporting. The severe punishment is the school's decision. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But others might argue that the author should have had more empathy. However, the story doesn't mention any malicious intent, just frustration with the school's initial action. So leaning towards B.\n"
