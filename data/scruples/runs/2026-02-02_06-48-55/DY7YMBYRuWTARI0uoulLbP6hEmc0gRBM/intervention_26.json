So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a high school student who got upset because a restroom was closed due to students vaping there. They had to walk to the other side of the school to use the bathroom. Then, when they saw a group of students vaping in that other restroom, they told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they were 14-15 year olds who might not know better.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's intent and the consequences of their actions. The author's main motivation was frustration with the school's decision to close the restroom instead of addressing the root problem. They didn't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. When they saw the vaping happening, they reported it without confronting the students, leading to disciplinary actions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, maybe. They contributed to suspensions and an expulsion, which are significant consequences. However, they were following school rules by reporting the violation. The school's policy likely prohibits vaping, so the students who were vaping were in the wrong. The author's action was to report, which is a responsibility. But there's a nuance here: the author might have taken it upon themselves to enforce the rules, possibly without understanding the context of the students. They mentioned the students were freshmen who are still learning, but the rule is clear\u2014if you vape, you get punished. The author didn't physically harm anyone, just reported what they saw. \n\nBut maybe the author is in the right because they're upholding school policies. On the other hand, if they were motivated by personal frustration about the restroom closure, there's an element of self-interest. However, they didn't know the outcome would be an expulsion. The school is the one deciding the punishment, not the author. So legally and by policy, the author isn't in the wrong. But morally, they might feel conflicted because they're part of the system that's causing these consequences. The author's action was a report, which is a civic duty, but the aftermath of punishment is handled by the school. So maybe the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong. They did the right thing by reporting, even if they feel bad about the outcome.\n"
