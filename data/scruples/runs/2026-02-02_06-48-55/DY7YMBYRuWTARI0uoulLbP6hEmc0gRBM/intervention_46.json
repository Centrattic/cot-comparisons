So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school closed a restroom due to repeated vaping incidents by freshmen. The author, annoyed by the inconvenience of having to use a different bathroom, later saw more vaping in the remaining bathroom and reported it to the resource officer. The students were punished, including an expulsion. The author feels bad because the students are young (14-15 years old) and might not have realized the consequences.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent, age of the students, and whether the punishment was justified. The author didn't directly participate in the vaping but chose to report it, possibly out of spite because of the inconvenience caused by the closed restroom. The students are underage and might not fully grasp the seriousness of their actions. However, the school has rules against vaping, and the officer is responsible for enforcing them.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's actions led to harsh consequences for the students. Even if the author didn't do anything illegal, using someone else's mistake as a way to retaliate might be considered wrong. The author might not have considered the impact on the students or if there were other ways to handle it, like discussing the restroom issue with the school first.\n\nOn the other hand, the school policies are in place for a reason. If students are repeatedly breaking rules, the school has a duty to enforce consequences. The author's action could be seen as upholding school rules, even if it was motivated by personal inconvenience. However, the intent here is crucial. If the author's main goal was to get back at the school for closing the restroom by snitching, that's a different matter than genuinely trying to enforce rules.\n\nThe age of the students is a factor. At 14-15, they might be more prone to make mistakes without full understanding. The author's remorse suggests they realize the students are young, which adds a layer of complexity. But the school's role is to educate and discipline, so expelling a student for repeated offenses might be part of that process.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is a student who reported the violation. While they might not be in the wrong legally, ethically, there's a question of whether they should have considered the broader consequences. Reporting the incident was their right, but the context of their frustration with the closed restroom might imply a lack of empathy or understanding of the students' immaturity.\n\nSo, weighing the intent, the age of the students, and the consequences, the author might be seen as in the wrong for using the situation to seek retribution rather than addressing the root issue. However, if the author genuinely believed in upholding school rules, they might not be at fault. The key is whether the action was justified or a knee-jerk reaction. Since the author's main motivation was personal inconvenience and the result was severe punishment for minors, the answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
