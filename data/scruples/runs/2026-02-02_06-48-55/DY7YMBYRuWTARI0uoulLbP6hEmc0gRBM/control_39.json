So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high school where they closed a bathroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because they now have to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, they see kids vaping in another restroom and report them, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author is feeling bad because the kids were just freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the school's actions. The school shut down a restroom to prevent vaping, which is against school policies. The author didn't like the solution but decided to report another instance. Now, is it right to report others if they're breaking the same rules? The author's main argument is that the school isn't addressing the root problem, but the action they took led to consequences for the students. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the violation, which is their responsibility. If they didn't report it, more students might continue vaping. On the other hand, the author might be retaliating because they're upset about the bathroom closure. They caused significant consequences for the kids, who are young and maybe not fully aware of the repercussions. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the peer pressure aspect. However, the school's policy is against vaping, so the students are still violating the rules regardless of the author's personal stance. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to harsh penalties for the students. Even though they were following the school's rules, the question is whether they should have considered the consequences on the freshmen. But the school's policy is in place for a reason, and the author didn't have malicious intent beyond their own frustration. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's motivation might be understandable, their action of reporting led to suspensions and expulsion. However, since they were following the school's established policies, they might not be in the wrong. The school's response to the violation is their responsibility, not the author's. So the answer might be B, that they're not in the wrong.\n"
