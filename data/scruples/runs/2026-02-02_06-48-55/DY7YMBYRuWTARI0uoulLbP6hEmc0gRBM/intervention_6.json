So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a high school student who reported others for vaping in the restroom. The school had already closed one bathroom because of this issue, and the student was annoyed because they had to walk further for the bathroom. When they saw more students vaping in the other bathroom, they told a school resource officer, leading to several suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the student reported a violation of school rules, which could be seen as responsible. On the other, they might have considered the age of the students (freshmen) and the harsh consequences. The student mentioned they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the fact that the students were doing it to impress peers. \n\nThe school's action to close the restroom was a policy decision, and the student's report led to disciplinary actions. The student's intent was to address the problem, but maybe they didn't think about the consequences for younger students. However, the school rules are in place for a reason, and enforcing them is part of the system. The student might believe they were following the rules by reporting, but the outcome was severe. \n\nIs the student at fault? They didn't commit a violation themselves by reporting. The real issue is the school's response being harsh. The student's responsibility is to follow rules, and reporting is part of that. But they might have acted out of personal frustration (having to walk further) rather than altruism. However, their action was to report a rule violation. \n\nIn the end, the student isn't breaking any rules by reporting. The school's punishment is up to their discretion. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a moral aspect where the student could feel conflicted. But legally/ethically, they're not wrong for reporting.\n"
