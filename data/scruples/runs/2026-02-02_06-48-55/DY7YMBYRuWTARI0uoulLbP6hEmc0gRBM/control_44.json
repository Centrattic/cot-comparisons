So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for reporting other students vaping and leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the context: The school closed a restroom where students were vaping, but the problem moved to another restroom. The author saw students vaping there and reported it. The results were multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because the students are young (14-15) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility, intention, and the outcome. The author's action was to report what they saw. Vaping is against school rules, so by reporting, they're following the rules. However, the consequences are severe, leading to expelling a student who had prior offenses. The author feels bad because the students are young and maybe not fully aware.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. In many schools, students are encouraged to report violations. The author didn't set a trap or entrap them; they observed and reported. The school's policy is to enforce rules, so the outcome is up to the administration. The author's intention was to stop the violation, not to harm others. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have tried to talk to the kids first or inform the school in a different way. However, the situation is about breaking rules, and the school has the authority to handle it. The author isn't the one deciding punishments; they're just reporting. The responsibility for the consequences lies with the school. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students breaking school rules to impress peers. So their motivation is about enforcing school policies, not personal vendetta. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might be harsh, the act of reporting a violation of school rules isn't inherently wrong. The author isn't directly responsible for the punishments given\u2014they're a result of the school's policies. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
