So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting multiple students suspended and one expelled. The situation is about a high school closing a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because now they have to walk further, saw kids vaping in the other bathroom, and told the school resource officer. The consequences were some suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because they're all freshmen, around 14-15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. They witnessed students violating school rules by vaping in the bathroom. Even though they don't have a problem with vaping per se, the students were doing it on school property, which is against the rules. Reporting them would be the right thing to do, as it's about enforcing school policies. But the author is feeling guilty because the kids are young and maybe not fully aware of the consequences. However, the school's job is to enforce rules regardless of age. The author didn't confront the students directly but informed the authorities, which is a standard way to report misconduct. The school's reaction (suspensions/expulsion) is their decision based on the student's history. The author isn't at fault here because they're reporting illegal activity. They might feel conflicted, but legally and ethically, they're not in the wrong. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
