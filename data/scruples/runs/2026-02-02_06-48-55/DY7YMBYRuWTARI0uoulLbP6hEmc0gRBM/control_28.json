So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a high school that closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because now they have to walk a long way to the bathroom. Then, when they see a bunch of kids vaping in the other restroom, they report it, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because these are young freshmen.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The school was already dealing with a problem by closing a bathroom, which didn't fix the issue. The author saw kids vaping and reported it. The action led to suspensions and an expulsion. The author's intent was to stop the vaping, but now they're worried about the consequences on the kids.\n\nFirst, the school's policy: if vaping is against school rules, then the students are violating them. The author reported the incident, which is typically seen as the right thing to do. However, the school's approach of closing a bathroom instead of addressing the root issue might be part of the problem. But the author's action was to report the violation, which is expected in such cases. \n\nBut the author did confront the students? Wait, the user says they didn't say anything to the kids but went to the resource officer. So their action was to inform the authorities. That's usually considered responsible. However, the school's response was severe\u2014expelling a kid who had been caught multiple times. The author might feel guilt because the kids are young, but if the school's rules are clear, then the students are responsible for their actions. \n\nBut wait, was the author trying to take the law into their own hands? They didn't do that; they reported to the proper authority. So the school's decision to expel is their responsibility, not the author's. The author's action was to follow the rules. However, maybe the author's motivation was partly about their own inconvenience (having to walk further) which could be seen as a personal grudge. But they didn't target those kids specifically; they just reported what they saw. \n\nIs there a duty to report such violations? In a school setting, students are often encouraged to report issues. So the author's action is in line with that. However, the consequences were harsh. But the school's policies determine the punishment, not the student. \n\nSo, the author's action was to report a violation. The school's response is a separate matter. Unless the author had malicious intent or went beyond their role (like confronting the students physically), they aren't in the wrong. The author's own feelings about the inconvenience and the school's ineffective measure might be part of their motivation, but the act itself is not wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They reported the violation as they should have. The school's handling of the punishment is their responsibility, not the student's.\n"
