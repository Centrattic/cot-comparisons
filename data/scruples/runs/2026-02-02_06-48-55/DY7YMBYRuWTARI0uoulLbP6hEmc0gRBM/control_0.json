So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a high school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they had to walk farther to use the bathroom. Then, when they saw kids vaping in the other restroom, they reported it to the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids were freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies. The school probably has a policy against vaping, so the students who were caught were violating those rules. By reporting them, the author was following the school's procedures by informing an authority figure. However, the author didn't directly confront the students but instead went to the officer immediately. That might be seen as tattling, but if the school is enforcing the rules regardless, the author isn't necessarily at fault. \n\nThe author's motivation was frustration with the inconvenience caused by the closed restroom. They might have felt that the school wasn't addressing the problem by just closing the bathroom instead of disciplining the students. By reporting the incident, they were trying to get the issue resolved. But the consequences were severe\u2014expulsions and suspensions for minors. The author is concerned because the kids are young and might not understand the repercussions.\n\nOn one hand, the author followed the right procedure by reporting to the resource officer. On the other hand, maybe they could have approached the situation differently, like talking to a teacher first or suggesting a solution to the school administration. However, the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the school's policy is clear and the students were indeed violating it, then the author isn't wrong for reporting. The severity of the punishment is up to the school's discretion, not the student's. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of intent. The author's main issue was personal inconvenience, which might cloud their judgment. However, they didn't fabricate the situation; they observed the students vaping and reported it. The fact that one student was expelled might be a result of repeated offenses, which the author wasn't aware of. The author might feel guilty because they didn't know the history, but their action was based on what they saw. \n\nIs there a gray area here? Maybe. If the author had a history of being a tattletale, it could be seen differently. But based on the scenario, they acted on their observation and followed the proper channel. The school's responsibility is to enforce rules, so if the students were in the wrong, the author's action was appropriate. Therefore, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). However, the author's feelings of guilt show empathy, which is a positive trait, but doesn't necessarily make them wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
