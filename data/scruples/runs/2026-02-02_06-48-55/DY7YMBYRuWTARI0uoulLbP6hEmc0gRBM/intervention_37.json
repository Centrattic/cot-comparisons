So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a student who reported others vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids were freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem moved to another bathroom. The author, annoyed by having to walk farther, saw kids vaping there and told the resource officer. The consequences were severe, including an expulsion. The author's main concern is that the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nNow, thinking about right and wrong. On one hand, the school has rules against vaping, and the students were breaking them. The author reported them, which is technically following the rules. But the author was upset about the inconvenience and used that as a motive. The question is whether the author acted inappropriately.\n\nAnother angle: is it the author's responsibility to enforce school rules? Some might say yes, as students should report violations. However, using personal annoyance (having to walk farther) as a reason to report others could be seen as vindictive. Also, the author mentions not having a problem with vaping but disapproves of the students doing it to impress peers. That might be a double standard, but maybe not the main issue.\n\nThe severity of the punishment is another point. Expelling a student is a major action. The author might feel guilty because they didn't consider the long-term impact on the kids. But is the author responsible for the school's disciplinary decisions? The author reported the incident, which led to consequences, but the school's actions are separate.\n\nMoral vs. legal wrong. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, some might argue that targeting peers, especially younger students, for personal convenience is poor judgment. However, others might say that following school policies is the right thing to do regardless of personal feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether the author's intent and the resulting consequences make their actions wrong. If the author acted out of spite or personal inconvenience rather than genuine concern, that could make them in the wrong. But if they were upholding school rules, they might not be. Given the context, the author's motivation seems self-serving (annoyed by the inconvenience), so they might be in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
