So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The writer feels bad because the kids are freshmen (14-15 years old) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting illegal activity, even if done by minors, is generally seen as a responsible action. However, the context here is that the school had already closed a restroom due to vaping but the problem persists. The writer decides to take matters into their own hands by informing the school resource officer. \n\nBut wait, the writer says they didn't have a problem with vaping per se, but the fact that it's happening in school. So they're more concerned about the rule-breaking than the act itself. However, by acting as a tattletale, the writer caused severe consequences. The key point is whether the writer overstepped by not confronting the students first or giving them a chance to stop, but instead immediately reporting them to authorities. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions they were upset about the restroom closure affecting their schedule. There's a potential for personal motive here. They might have been more motivated by their own inconvenience than the well-being of the students. \n\nEthically, there's a debate about whether it's right to report peers for minor offenses, especially when the school's response is already harsh. The writer's actions led to an expulsion, which is a significant punishment. Even if the students were breaking rules, the writer didn't attempt to resolve it through other means first. \n\nOn the other hand, the school is responsible for enforcing rules. If the students are indeed violating policies, the school has the authority to take action. The writer's role might be to report, but maybe they should have approached it differently. \n\nConsidering the age of the students, 14-15 is a time when judgment is still developing. The writer's action might have contributed to a harsher outcome than necessary. The writer felt guilt about the consequences, which suggests they might feel they acted impulsively without considering the impact.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the writer reported illegal activity, which is generally right, but the method and motive might be questionable. They didn't address the students directly, and their own frustration with the restroom closure could have influenced their decision. The resulting punishments were severe, and the writer's action might have exacerbated the situation rather than solving it. \n\nTherefore, while the act of reporting isn't inherently wrong, the context and consequences might make the writer responsible for overstepping, especially if the intention was more about personal inconvenience than genuinely helping. So the answer is A.\n"
