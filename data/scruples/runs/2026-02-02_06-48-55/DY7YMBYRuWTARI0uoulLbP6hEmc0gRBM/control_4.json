So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping students is in the wrong. The situation is that a restroom was closed because students were vaping there, which annoyed the author because they had to walk further. The author then went into another bathroom, saw students vaping there, and told the school resource officer. This led to several suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because the kids are freshmen (14-15) and maybe didn't understand the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If vaping is against school policy, then the students are at fault. The author reported them, which is a responsible action in terms of following rules. However, the author might feel conflicted because they don't have an issue with vaping itself, just the violation of school rules. But the author's main gripe was the closure of the restroom, which made their life harder. By reporting others, they might be seen as taking a personal vendetta, even though their action was technically correct.\n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the students directly, just informed the authorities. The consequences were severe (expulsion), which might be disproportionate if it's the students' first offense. But if the kid had prior violations, the expulsion might be justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author may feel guilty for causing peers to get in trouble, especially younger students. But legally and according to school rules, the students were breaking policies. The author's action was to report the violation, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the author's motivation (personal inconvenience) could be seen as self-serving, which might make them feel guilty. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules. The author is within their rights to report violations. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that they should have addressed the issue differently, like talking to a teacher about the restroom closure first instead of snitching on others. But the school's policy is to enforce rules, so the author did their part. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting the violations, even if it caused discomfort for others. They followed the rules as they were given.\n"
