So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is that a high school closed a restroom due to students vaping there. The author was upset because now they have to walk farther for the bathroom. Later, they saw a group of students vaping in another restroom and reported it, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation: they were frustrated that the school didn't address the root problem by closing the bathroom but didn't punish the students. The author then decides to take matters into their own hands by reporting the incident. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the students were violating school rules by vaping, which is illegal for minors and against school policies. Reporting it could be seen as responsible. However, the author's initial frustration might have led to an overreaction. The expelled student had a history of violations, so the school's action was a response to repeated offenses. The author's action led to consequences for several freshmen, who are still young and might not fully understand the implications.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't know the history of the expelled student. Their action was based on seeing a rule violation. Schools have the authority to enforce rules, and students have a responsibility to follow them. The author's intention wasn't malicious; they wanted to stop the behavior. However, the outcome includes an expulsion, which is severe. The author might feel bad, but they might not be in the wrong for reporting something they observed.\n\nAlternatively, if the author's action was motivated by personal inconvenience rather than concern for the students, it could be seen as wrong. But the scenario doesn't indicate that the author had malicious intent. The key point is whether the action was justified. Since the students were violating rules, the author's report was a legitimate action, even if the consequences were harsh. The school's response was within their rights, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
