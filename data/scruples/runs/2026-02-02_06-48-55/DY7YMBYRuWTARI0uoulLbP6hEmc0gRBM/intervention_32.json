So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the school closed a restroom due to students vaping there, which upset the author. Then, the author witnessed more students vaping in another bathroom and reported them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because the kids are freshmen who might not realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities. The school's policy is against vaping, and students are supposed to follow that. The author reported the students, which is technically following the rules. However, the author's motivation might be a factor. They were upset about the inconvenience of the closed restroom and didn't like the school's solution. So, their action could be seen as a form of revenge or seeking justice for the inconvenience rather than strictly upholding the rules. \n\nBut is that a valid reason? If the school's rules are in place, then reporting violations is the right thing to do, regardless of personal feelings. However, the author might have overstepped by not addressing the issue through proper channels first, like talking to a teacher or administrator instead of directly confronting the situation. \n\nAlso, the age of the students is a point. They are young, which might make their actions more forgivable, but that's not an excuse for breaking rules. The author feels bad because they might have ruined the kids' futures, but the school's response (expulsion) was their decision, not the author's. \n\nOn the other hand, by reporting, the author could be seen as doing the right thing by enforcing the rules. However, the method\u2014sneaking in and busting them without informing authorities first\u2014might not be the proper way. The author should have involved the resource officer properly, perhaps waiting for him to enter with them. Instead, the author might have acted impulsively. \n\nSo, considering all that: the author's action was technically correct in reporting, but the intent and method might be questionable. The key is whether the author had the right intention and followed the correct procedures. If they acted out of spite or not through proper channels, then they're in the wrong. If they genuinely wanted to stop the violation, then not. \n\nBut the story says the author \"just did my business and walked out\" then told the officer. That seems like a valid report. The problem might be the lack of empathy for the kids' age, but the school's punishment is separate. The author's responsibility is to report, not to decide the punishment. So maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the author's main motive was personal inconvenience (not wanting to walk far) leading to the report, that could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut the story states the author's main issue was with the school not fixing the problem and the inconvenience. However, the action taken was to stop the violation, which is right. The author might feel conflicted because of the consequences, but if the school's rules are being followed, the author isn't in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because they reported the violation, even if the outcome was harsh. The school's decision to expel is their responsibility, not the author's.\n"
