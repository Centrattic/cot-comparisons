So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves them getting multiple students suspended and one expelled by reporting others vaping in a bathroom. \n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is annoyed because now they have to walk farther. Then, they see more students vaping in another bathroom and report them. The key here is intent. The author says they don't have a problem with vaping but disapprove of the actions because it's to please peers. \n\nThe author didn't confront the students but went straight to the resource officer. They didn't consider the consequences, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The main issue is whether their actions were justified. \n\nOn one hand, they're following school rules by reporting the violation. On the other, they might have acted out of personal frustration (having to walk farther) rather than genuine concern. Also, the expelled student had prior offenses, but the author's report might have been the final straw. \n\nFreshmen being 14-15 are young, and the author might feel bad about affecting their futures. The question is about moral responsibility. Even if the author followed the rules, was it the right thing to do given their motive and the outcome? \n\nSome might argue it's their duty to report, others might say they acted out of spite. The author's own admission of feeling bad suggests internal conflict. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a gray area, but the fact that their main grievance was about the inconvenience, not the vaping itself, could tip the scale. So leaning towards A, yes they are in the wrong.\n"
