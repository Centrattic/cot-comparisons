So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high school that closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk to another bathroom, and then they saw kids vaping in that new bathroom. Instead of telling them directly, they went to the resource officer and reported it, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids were all freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The school has a policy against vaping on school property, right? So the students were breaking the rules. The school's response to the original problem was to close the bathroom, which the author didn't like. But the students kept vaping in the new bathroom. The author didn't confront them directly but reported to the officer. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting them.\n\nOn one hand, the author did the right thing by reporting a violation. It's against school policy, so informing the authorities is a responsible action. The fact that it led to suspensions and an expulsion might be a consequence, but the author didn't create the rules. However, the author's motivation was partly out of frustration because of the inconvenience from the closed bathroom. That might cloud their judgment. Also, the kids are young, and the author feels bad about their punishment. But the school enforces the rules regardless. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author's actions were justified. The students were breaking the rules, and the author didn't have to confront them themselves. Reporting is a valid method. The school's policy is to take action when violations occur. So the author isn't in the wrong for following school procedures. The fact that the author was annoyed with the closed bathroom might make their actions seem self-serving, but the actual act of reporting a policy violation is correct. The school's response (suspensions/expulsion) is up to them. The author didn't force the officer to take action; they just reported what they saw. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer should be B.\n"
