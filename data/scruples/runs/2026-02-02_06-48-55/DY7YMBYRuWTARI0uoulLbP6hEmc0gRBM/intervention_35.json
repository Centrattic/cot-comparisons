So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, and the author got annoyed because they now have to walk further to use the bathroom. Then, the author sees kids vaping in the other bathroom, decides to report them, and ends up getting several suspended and one expelled. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They didn't report the first instances when the bathroom was closed down. Instead, they waited until they saw kids vaping in the new bathroom. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but think the kids are doing it to impress peers. Then they snitched on them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. \n\nNow, from the school's perspective, they're trying to enforce rules against vaping. The author is a student who reported the violation. Normally, reporting rule violations isn't inherently wrong, but there might be nuances. The author was motivated by their own frustration about having to walk further. Also, the expelled kid was a repeat offender. The author feels bad because they're freshmen. \n\nI wonder if there's a difference between reporting a violation and snitching with malicious intent. The author might have a personal grudge against the kids for causing their inconvenience. But schools do rely on students to report infractions. On the other hand, the author didn't take any action until they were personally inconvenienced. The expelled kid had been caught multiple times, so maybe the school's action was justified.\n\nBut the author is upset that they didn't fix the problem before and now took matters into their own hands. However, their action led to severe consequences for the kids. The key is whether the author acted out of spite rather than a genuine concern for enforcing the rules. If the author's main issue was the inconvenience to themselves and they used the school's rules to take revenge, that's more problematic. \n\nThe school's initial response was to close the bathroom instead of addressing the root cause. The author's action might have been a way to make the school take action again. But the author isn't in a position to enforce school policies; that's the school's job. By reporting the kids, the author allowed the school to take action, which they weren't doing before. However, the author's personal frustration might have influenced their decision, which could be seen as a misuse of their position as a whistleblower. \n\nIn some cases, reporting violations is the right thing to do regardless of personal feelings. But if the motivation is revenge or personal gain, it could be wrong. The author mentions they don't mind vaping but dislike it being done to impress others. That could be a genuine concern about peer pressure. However, the consequences were severe for the kids, especially the expelled one who was a repeat offender. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because their primary motivation was their own inconvenience rather than a genuine concern for the school's rules or the well-being of the students. They might have taken advantage of the school's enforcement mechanisms to get back at the students for making their life harder, leading to unfair consequences for the kids. The fact that they didn't report earlier incidents and only acted when it affected them personally suggests a self-serving motive. So, the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
