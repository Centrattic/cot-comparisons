So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in the bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping, which the author found inconvenient. Then, when seeing more students vaping, the author reported them to the resource officer. The author didn't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. The result was several suspensions and an expulsion of a repeat offender. The author feels bad because they were all freshmen, young and not fully aware of consequences.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, the school has rules against vaping, and students are supposed to follow them. By reporting the violation, the author is following school policies. However, the author's motivation might matter. The frustration over the closed restroom led to this action. But the act of reporting illegal activity (vaping in school, which is against rules) isn't inherently wrong. \n\nHowever, the moral aspect: even if the action was justified, the consequences were severe. The expelled student had prior offenses. The author might have contributed to harsh punishments, especially against younger students. But the school is responsible for enforcing rules, so the author's role was to report, which is a duty. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront the students first but directly reported to the officer. Maybe they could have addressed it with the students first. But in a school setting, resource officers handle such issues. The author might not be in the wrong for following procedures. \n\nThe author's own frustration about the school's decision to close the restroom is a personal grievance, but that doesn't make reporting the violation wrong. The main issue is whether the act of reporting is wrong. The author isn't violating any rules; they're upholding them. \n\nBut considering the age of the students and the severity of expulsion, maybe the author should have considered if the school's response was too harsh. However, the user isn't the one deciding the punishment; that's the school's role. The author is just reporting the incident. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as they reported a rule violation. However, the emotional impact on younger students could be a point, but the author's action was within their right to report. The school's enforcement is their responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
