So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them reporting others for vaping in the school bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is now feeling bad because the kids were all freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem persisted. The author found a group vaping in the other bathroom and reported them. The author isn't against vaping per se but dislikes the school's approach and the fact that the action was peer-driven. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they reported the students, which could be seen as doing the right thing by following school rules. On the other hand, they might be seen as snitching, especially since the kids are young and maybe not fully aware of consequences. \n\nBut the school is the one who set the rules against vaping, so following those rules isn't inherently wrong. The author's motivation was frustration with the school's solution and their own inconvenience. However, the consequences were severe, leading to suspensions and expulsion. \n\nThe author might be in a gray area. They didn't know the outcome would be so harsh, but they still chose to report. The school's policy is in place, so the students were violating it. The author's action led to enforcement, which is the school's responsibility. \n\nBut considering the age of the students and the author's role in escalating the situation, some might argue the author is in the wrong. However, others might say they were just upholding the rules. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the judgment is based on intent and consequence. The author didn't have malicious intent, just frustration. The problem is the severe punishment, but that's the school's call, not the reporter's. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author reported a violation of school rules, even if it led to harsh consequences. But some might say A if they think the author should have handled it differently.\n"
