So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves high school students vaping, and the author taking action to report them. The key points are: the school closed a restroom due to vaping, the author felt this was unfair and inconvenient, then saw more students vaping in another restroom and reported them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation. They mention they don't have a problem with vaping but disapprove of the kids doing it to impress peers. So it's more about the school's handling of the situation and their personal inconvenience. They felt the school wasn't addressing the root issue by just closing a bathroom instead of punishing the students. Then, when they saw more students vaping, they reported them without directly confronting the vapers first.\n\nIs it wrong to report illegal activity? Generally, no. If the students were indeed violating school rules, reporting is a responsible action. However, the context here matters. The author might have acted out of spite due to their frustration with the school's initial decision. Also, the expelled student was caught multiple times, so maybe the school was already aware but hadn't taken strict action until the author's report escalated things. The author's intention to \"screw\" the kids might indicate a vindictive motive rather than purely stopping wrongdoing. \n\nBut again, if the author believed they were helping the school enforce rules, it's a gray area. The problem is the author's frustration with the school's handling might have led them to take matters into their own hands, which could be seen as overstepping. Also, the expelled student's prior offenses might mean the school had to take stronger action, but the author's role in that is questionable. \n\nConsidering the age of the kids (14-15), they are minors and might not fully understand consequences. The author's action led to significant consequences, including expulsion. If the author's main issue was the school's initial inaction, then stepping in could be seen as trying to force the school to act, which might not be their responsibility. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the students were indeed violating rules, the author had a right to report. The question is whether the author acted in bad faith. The phrase \"screw and told what was currently happening\" suggests maybe they didn't think through the repercussions. Also, the fact that they felt bad afterward shows some remorse, which might indicate they didn't intend to harm the kids but wanted to address the school's inaction.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if their primary motive was spite or to get back at the school for closing a bathroom. However, if they genuinely wanted to stop the rule-breaking, even if it was for their own frustration, it's a bit more nuanced. But since they admit they didn't confront the vapers first and just reported them immediately, maybe that's where the line is crossed. They could have approached the students to ask them to stop first, but instead, went straight to the authority, leading to harsh consequences. \n\nIn school settings, there's usually a process for handling such issues. The author bypassed that, perhaps out of anger, making them complicit in the harsh outcomes. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm still a bit conflicted because reporting illegal activity is usually acceptable. However, the context here with the author's possible spite and the resulting expulsion of a student might tip it towards A.\n"
