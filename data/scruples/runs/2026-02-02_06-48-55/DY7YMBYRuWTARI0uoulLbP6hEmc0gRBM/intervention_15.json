So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author got annoyed because now they have to walk far for the bathroom. Then, when they saw a group of students vaping in the other restroom, they went to the resource officer and reported them. This led to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author is upset because the kids are just 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Schools have policies against vaping, right? If the students are violating school rules by vaping, then the school is supposed to take action. The author is reporting the violation, which is their right. But maybe the author's motivation matters here. They were upset about the inconvenience of the closed restroom. Could that make their action less about justice and more about personal annoyance?\n\nBut wait, the author says they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just that the kids are doing it to impress peers. So maybe the author is acting out of a sense of responsibility to enforce rules, even if they're frustrated. However, the result is that several students faced severe consequences. The author feels bad because they're freshmen who might not fully understand the implications. \n\nIs it the author's fault that the school took strict action? The school's policy might dictate expulsion after repeated offenses. The author might not be responsible for the school's disciplinary choices. But did the author act in a way that was just, or did they take a personal vendetta? \n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the violation. On the other hand, maybe they could have addressed their frustration differently, like talking to a teacher about the restroom closure first. But the school already closed the restroom, which might not be a solution. The author's action might be seen as trying to enforce the rules they felt were not properly enforced before. \n\nBut the author's main issue was the inconvenience, which makes me wonder if their motivation was appropriate. However, the act of reporting a violation isn't inherently wrong. The school's response is up to their policies. The author is in a dilemma between their frustration and the outcome. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right because they reported a rule violation. However, their personal annoyance could be a factor. But since the students were actually breaking the rules, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they acted within their right to report the violation, even if the outcome upset them. Alternatively, maybe A if their motivation was more about personal annoyance than concern for the rules. But the line between personal vendetta and duty is blurry here. I think the key is whether the action was justified. Since vaping is against school rules, reporting it is correct, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
