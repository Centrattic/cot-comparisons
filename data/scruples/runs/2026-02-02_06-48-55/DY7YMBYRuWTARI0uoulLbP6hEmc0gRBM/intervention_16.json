So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a student who reported other students vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author found another group vaping in the remaining restroom and reported them, causing consequences. The author feels bad because the students were young and maybe didn't realize the impact of their actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants opinions. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the rules of the school. If the school has a policy against vaping, then students are expected to follow it. The author reported the violation, which is a responsible action. However, the author's motivation was frustration with the school's decision to close a restroom, which might have influenced their actions. But the act of reporting misconduct is generally seen as positive, especially if it's against school rules. However, the author didn't confront the students directly, just informed the resource officer. \n\nThe fact that the expelled student had prior violations might mean the school's action was proportionate. The author's intention was to solve a problem they saw in the school's handling of the issue. But they might be questioning their role as a tattletale. However, in a school setting, students can report rule violations without being in the wrong, as it's part of maintaining a safe environment. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had prior issues or a grudge against the students, it could be seen as vindictive. But the post doesn't mention that. The author's main complaint is about the inconvenience of the school's decision. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author reported a rule violation, which is the right thing to do. Even though they might feel conflicted about the consequences, their action was within the school's policies. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
