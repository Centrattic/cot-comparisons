So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported others for vaping in a closed restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they had to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, they saw more students vaping in another bathroom and reported them. The consequences were suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the students were young (freshmen), but they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just the behavior of doing it to impress others.\n\nNow, considering the rules. Schools have policies against vaping to maintain safety and discipline. The author reported the students for violating those policies. But the author's motivation was personal annoyance, not just concern for the rules. They didn't speak to the students first but immediately told the resource officer. This could be seen as tattling or seeking revenge rather than addressing the problem constructively.\n\nOn the other hand, the school's policy is in place for a reason. If multiple students are vaping repeatedly, especially if someone has prior offenses, the school might need to take action to deter such behavior. The expelled student had been caught many times, so severe punishment might be justified.\n\nBut the author's action led to multiple suspensions and an expulsion, which are serious consequences for teenagers. The question is whether the author overstepped. The author's main issue was their own inconvenience, not necessarily the health or safety of others. Vaping can be harmful, but the author says they don't have a problem with it. So their motivation was more about the school's handling of the problem and their personal inconvenience.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if someone reports others for breaking rules, even if the rules are flawed, they might be in the wrong if their actions are driven by spite. However, if the school's policies are clear and the students are indeed violating them, then the author might be doing their part to uphold the rules.\n\nBut the school's solution (closing the restroom) didn't address the root issue. The author's action might have been a way to vent frustration with the school's inaction. However, the outcome affected students who are still young and learning. The author didn't try to resolve the issue through proper channels first, like talking to a teacher or staff member about the problem, but instead took a more direct approach that led to harsh consequences.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because their motivation was personal annoyance, and they didn't attempt to address the issue through appropriate methods before reporting. Instead of solving the problem, they escalated it, leading to harsher penalties for the students. The school's policy might not have been effectively communicated or enforced, and the author's action bypassed any chance for a more measured response.\n"
