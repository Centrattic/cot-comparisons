So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported a group of kids vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels conflicted because the kids were just freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and school policy aspects. Vaping in school is typically against the rules, so the kids were breaking the rules regardless of their age. By reporting them, the author is technically following the rules by informing an authority figure. But then again, the author's motivation is part of the issue. They mentioned being annoyed because the school shut down a restroom, which led to inconvenience for them. That personal inconvenience might have influenced their decision to report, which could be seen as self-serving.\n\nNext, the age of the students. Since they're freshmen, they might be less aware of the consequences. However, underage vaping is still a policy violation. The school's response might be strict because they need to enforce rules consistently. The author might feel guilty because they see the kids as not fully understanding the situation, but the school's job is to enforce policies regardless of the students' maturity level.\n\nAnother angle is the author's approach. They didn't confront the kids directly but instead went straight to the resource officer. Is that the right thing to do? In many schools, reporting such incidents to authorities is the correct procedure. However, the method of reporting could be questioned. Did they have a duty to warn the kids first? Or is it acceptable to report immediately when you witness a violation?\n\nThen there's the outcome: multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad about the consequences, especially since the expelled student had prior violations. If the author knew about the expelled student's history, they might be more aware of the potential severity. But if they didn't, it's still a result of the school's disciplinary process.\n\nEthically, is it right to report others for a rule that, in their opinion, isn't being enforced properly? The author is frustrated with the school's decision to close a restroom instead of addressing the vapers. By reporting, they might be trying to hold the school accountable for enforcing the rules consistently. However, their personal vendetta against the school's actions could cloud their judgment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it to please peers. That complicates things. It seems like a moral judgment from the author about the kids' reasons for vaping, which might not be their place to judge. The school's rules are about the act itself, not the intent behind it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, students are expected to follow school rules and report violations. But there's also a consideration for peer support and understanding the pressures of being a freshman. The author's action might be seen as a responsible choice, but the guilt comes from the impact on younger students.\n\nI think the key points here are whether the author acted within the school's policies and the ethical implications of their motivation. Legally and by school rules, they might not be in the wrong. However, ethically, their personal grievances and the consequences on younger students could make them wrong in the eyes of others. It's a tough call because both sides have valid points.\n"
