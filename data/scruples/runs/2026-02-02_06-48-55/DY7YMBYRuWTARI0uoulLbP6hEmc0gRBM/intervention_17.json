So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who got several kids suspended and one expelled for vaping in the restroom. The school had already closed a restroom due to similar issues, and the author felt it wasn't fair because they had to walk farther to the bathroom. When they saw more kids vaping, they reported them, leading to consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the actions taken. The school has a policy against vaping, and the students were violating it. The author reported the incident, which led to suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the violation. The school's policy is in place for a reason, and the resource officer is there to enforce it. The students were breaking the rules regardless of the restroom being closed. The author's action could be seen as responsible since they're helping the school maintain discipline.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have considered the context. The school's previous action of closing a restroom instead of addressing the root problem could have contributed to the ongoing issue. The author might have felt frustrated and took matters into their own hands, but they didn't confront the students first or report it through proper channels before the incident. However, in this case, they did report it to the resource officer, which is the correct procedure.\n\nThe fact that the expelled student had prior offenses is important. The school's decision to expel might be a result of repeated violations, not just this single incident. So the author isn't solely responsible for the expulsion. The author's intention was to follow the rules, even if they were frustrated with the school's handling of the problem.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration might have influenced their decision to report the incident immediately without perhaps giving the students a chance to stop. But since the students were actively breaking the rules, the officer's presence and the author's report were appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions led to suspensions and expulsion, they were following school policies. The school's own prior inaction might have contributed to the problem. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting a violation, even if the outcome seems harsh. Their responsibility was to enforce the rules they were aware of. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
