So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a high school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, and the author, frustrated, reported a group of students vaping in another restroom. This led to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they were mostly freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Schools have policies against vaping. The author is following the rules by reporting the violation. But was there a problem with the method? The author didn't confront the students but went to a resource officer. That seems like a responsible action. However, maybe the author overstepped. The original problem was the school closing a restroom, which the author found unfair. But the author's action was to report a current violation. \n\nThe author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but dislike the peer pressure aspect. So their motivation isn't about the act itself but others doing it to fit in. But the law or school policy is about the act regardless. \n\nThe consequences were severe: expulsions. The author might not have intended that, but they did report the violation. The school's decision to expel someone who had prior incidents is their policy. The author might feel guilt because the kids are young, but they didn't know about their prior offenses. \n\nIs the author wrong? If they followed the correct procedure by informing the resource officer, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But maybe they could have addressed the issue with the school administration first instead of directly confronting the situation. However, the author didn't confront the students but reported the incident, which is appropriate. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No), as they were following the rules and reporting illegal activity. However, maybe the author's motivation was more about the initial frustration with the closed restroom, leading to a harsh reaction. But the action itself was to stop a policy violation. \n\nStill, if the author didn't know about the prior offenses, they aren't responsible for the expulsions. The school's decision is their responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the violation. So answer B.\n"
