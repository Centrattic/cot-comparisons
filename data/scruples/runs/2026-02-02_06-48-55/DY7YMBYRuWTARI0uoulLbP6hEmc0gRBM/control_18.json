So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down. \n\nFirst, the situation: The school closed a restroom because students, mostly freshmen, were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk far to the bathroom. Then, the author saw a group of kids vaping in the other restroom and told the resource officer. As a result, several kids got suspended and one was expelled. The author is feeling guilty because the kids are 14-15 and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nHmm. The author didn't do anything illegal, right? Reporting a violation of school rules is usually expected. But the question is about being in the wrong morally. The author didn't set out to get the kids expelled; they just reported what they saw. However, the school's policy might have been strict, and the author's action led to harsh consequences. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just that the kids are doing it to please peers. So their intent wasn't to punish the kids for vaping but to stop the behavior in school. Yet, they didn't confront the kids directly but went straight to the resource officer. \n\nIs it wrong to report others without trying to address the issue directly first? Maybe the school's policy is clear that reporting is the correct step, so the author did the right thing. But some might argue that the author should have given the kids a chance to stop on their own or talk to them first. However, the author's main issue is with the school's inaction before, so they took proactive steps again. \n\nThe fact that the kids are young and may not understand the consequences could be a factor. But the school is still responsible for enforcing rules. The author might feel bad, but unless there was intent to harm or a personal vendetta, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards \"No, the author is not in the wrong.\" They reported a rule violation, which is their responsibility. The school's strict policy led to the suspensions/expulsion, not the author's direct action. But maybe there's nuance. If the author knew the expulsions would happen and didn't care, maybe there's an issue. However, the story says they didn't think much of it initially and later felt bad. That could indicate they acted out of concern but didn't foresee the severity. Still, the act of reporting is generally acceptable. So I'd go with B.\n"
