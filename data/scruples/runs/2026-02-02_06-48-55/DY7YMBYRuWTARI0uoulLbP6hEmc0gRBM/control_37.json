So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem didn't go away. The author, who is a student, got annoyed because they had to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, when they saw a group of freshmen vaping in the other restroom, they told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the school's responsibility. Vaping in school is against the rules, right? So the students who were vaping were breaking the rules. The school's job is to enforce those rules to maintain a safe environment. The author reported the incident, which is typically seen as the right thing to do. However, the author might be in the wrong if their actions were excessive or if they had ulterior motives.\n\nThe author mentions that they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. But they still reported it. The school's policy is to prevent vaping, regardless of the reason. So the author's action could be justified as upholding school rules. However, they were angry about the inconvenience caused by the closed restroom. This anger might have influenced their decision to report, which could be a point against them. If they were acting out of spite rather than concern for the rules, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the kids involved were freshmen, which the author feels bad about. The question is whether the punishment fits the action. If the school's policy is strict and the kids had prior offenses, then the expulsion might be in line with the rules. The author's role was to report the violation, and the school's administration made the decision to suspend or expel. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered if there was a way to address the issue without involving the resource officer, like talking to a teacher first or using an anonymous tip line. However, the author might not have known those options. Also, the school's response to close a restroom instead of addressing the root problem could be a factor. But the author's responsibility is to follow the rules, not necessarily to fix the school's policies.\n\nSo the key points are: the students were violating rules, the author reported it, the school took action as per their policies. The author's motivation might be a factor, but unless they fabricated the report, it's hard to say they're wrong. The school's handling of the initial problem is a separate issue. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a gray area regarding their intent.\n"
