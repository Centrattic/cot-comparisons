So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they had to walk further to the bathroom. Then, the author saw a bunch of freshmen vaping in the other bathroom, didn't confront them, but told a resource officer, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, the school's action to close the restroom is a bit questionable. They shut it down instead of addressing the underlying issue, like enforcing rules or educating the students. The author is upset about the inconvenience, which is understandable. But when the author sees the same problem happening in another bathroom, they report it, leading to consequences for the students. \n\nThe key points here: the author's intention was to address the issue they had with the bathroom closure by taking action. They didn't confront the students themselves but went to an authority figure. The problem is that the school's initial response was to shut down the bathroom instead of dealing with the root cause. The author's action might have been a reaction to that poor decision. However, the author's action resulted in suspensions and expulsion, which are harsh consequences for minors. \n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, reporting illegal or against-school-policy behavior isn't inherently wrong. However, the context is important. The author was motivated by personal inconvenience, not necessarily a desire to stop vaping. The school's initial handling might have set up a situation where students were being punished without addressing the real issues. If the resource officer didn't already know about the vaping, maybe the author's tip led to an overreaction. But if the school was already aware, then the author just provided evidence. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not having a problem with vaping but disapproving of the kids doing it to impress peers. The age of the students is a factor\u201414-15 is a young age where mistakes can have long-term consequences. The author might not have considered that their action could lead to severe penalties for first-time offenders.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school's initial action to close the bathroom without addressing the problem contributed to the issue. The author's report might have been an attempt to correct that, but the outcome was harsher than necessary. The line between doing the right thing and causing harm is thin here. The author's personal grievance about the bathroom closure might have influenced their decision, which could be seen as using the situation for personal gain (avoiding the long walk) rather than genuinely helping the school. \n\nBut on the other hand, the school had rules in place, and the author was following those rules by reporting the violation. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong because they reported a violation, but the school's handling of the situation is where the real fault lies. However, since the question is about the author's actions, and they took it upon themselves to report without considering the consequences for the students, maybe they are partially at fault. But if the school is responsible for the harsh punishment, the author might not be entirely to blame. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they reported a policy violation. However, there's a nuance here where their motivation was personal inconvenience, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The school's responsibility is to handle the situation appropriately. So the author's action was within their right to report, even if the consequences were harsh. So the answer is B.\n"
