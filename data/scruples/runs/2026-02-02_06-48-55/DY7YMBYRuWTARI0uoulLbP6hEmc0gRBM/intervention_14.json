So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are just freshmen around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. Then, the author saw more students vaping in the other bathroom and reported them. The key here is whether the author had a duty to report or if they acted out of personal frustration.\n\nThe author mentions they're upset because the school didn't fix the problem and now they have to walk farther. So maybe their motivation was more about their own inconvenience than stopping the actual wrongdoing. Also, the expelled student had been caught multiple times, so maybe the school's action was appropriate for repeated offenses.\n\nBut the author is questioning if they were right to get others suspended. Even if the action led to harsh consequences, the act of reporting students for violating school rules is generally seen as responsible. However, the author's intention might matter. If they did it to get back at the school for closing the restroom, that could be problematic. The story doesn't clearly state the motive, but the fact that they say \"I didn't really have a problem with vaping\" suggests they were more concerned about the school's handling of the situation rather than the act itself.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the students, maybe they made a mistake and the punishment was too severe. But since the school is enforcing its policies, the author might not be the one to decide that. However, the author's action led to these consequences, so they might feel guilty for being a tattletale.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent. If the person acted out of spite or personal gain, they're more in the wrong. Here, the author's motive seems mixed\u2014partly frustration with the school's policy and partly a desire to stop the vaping. It's a bit ambiguous. But since they reported the act itself, which is against school rules, the action itself might be justified. However, the fact that they felt it was the school's fault for not fixing the problem first might indicate their intent wasn't purely about upholding rules but about their own inconvenience.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their motivation was more about their own frustration than genuinely stopping the wrongdoing. They could have spoken to an authority about the policy instead of using this as a way to get back at the school indirectly. By reporting the students, they contributed to the suspensions/expulsions, which they now feel bad about. Their actions, while leading to a school policy outcome, were perhaps not the right approach given their personal grievances.\n"
