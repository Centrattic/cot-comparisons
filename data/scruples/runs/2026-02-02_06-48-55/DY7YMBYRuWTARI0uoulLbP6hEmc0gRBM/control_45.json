So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because they feel like they're being a tattletale but also don't support the school's handling of the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and laws. Vaping in school is usually against school policies, so the students were breaking rules. The school had already closed a restroom due to this, but the problem persisted. The author reported what they saw, which led to enforcement. \n\nBut the author's motivation matters. They were upset that the school didn't fix the problem and now they have to walk farther. So their personal inconvenience might have influenced their decision to report. However, they did report a violation, which is their right. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, they didn't know beforehand that one kid would be expelled, so they couldn't have intended that. They just wanted to report the ongoing issue. However, some might argue they overstepped by not addressing the root problem or by not giving the students a chance to stop. But others might say they're doing their part to follow rules. \n\nThe fact that the kids are freshmen doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The school is responsible for enforcing rules, and the author isn't the one deciding punishments. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have talked to a teacher earlier or found another solution. But in the moment, reporting to the resource officer is a direct action. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they reported a violation, but they might feel conflicted because of the consequences. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) since they're following school policy, even if they have mixed feelings.\n"
