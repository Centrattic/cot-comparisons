So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported vaping in the bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels conflicted because the students were young and maybe not fully aware of consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. The school had already shut down a restroom due to vaping, which suggests they had policies in place. The author reported the incident to the resource officer, which is a responsible action. However, the consequences were severe\u2014expulsion for one student. \n\nThe author's motivation was frustration with the school's previous handling of the issue. They felt the school wasn't addressing the problem and were inconvenienced by having to use a different restroom. But by reporting the incident, they followed the proper channels. \n\nNow, the question is whether this makes the author wrong. On one hand, they did the right thing by reporting illegal activity. On the other hand, maybe they should have considered the students' ages and circumstances. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, and the author didn't force the school to take action; the administration did that based on their policies. \n\nThe author might feel guilt because they see the students as young and naive, but the administration's job is to maintain discipline. The author isn't responsible for the school's decision to expel someone. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. They acted within their right to report a violation. The severity of the punishment is up to the school, not the student. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
