So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school closing a restroom because students were vaping there, and the author then reports a group of students vaping in another restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies of the school. If the school has a strict anti-vaping policy, then the students were breaking the rules. The author reported them, so he's following the rules by informing the authorities. But the school's action to close one restroom without addressing the root problem might have contributed to the issue moving elsewhere, which the author noticed.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author says he doesn't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. Reporting others can be seen as a responsible action, especially if he's concerned about the school's environment. However, some might argue that the students are young and need guidance, not punishment. The author might feel guilty because he's a peer, and it's harsh for the school to expel someone.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author did something wrong. He didn't encourage them to vape; he reported an ongoing violation. The school's decision to close one restroom instead of addressing the behavior could be a policy issue, but the user's action here is about enforcing the rules. The author might have overstepped if he was reckless, but the scenario suggests he acted when he saw the violation. Since the school's action led to closing a restroom, maybe the author felt it was unfair and wanted to stop the behavior from spreading. So, even though the consequences were severe, the act of reporting isn't inherently wrong unless there's malicious intent. The author's intention was to uphold school rules, so he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
