So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting several kids suspended and one expelled by reporting them for vaping in a restroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author thought this was a bad solution because it didn't fix the problem, and now they have to walk to another restroom. Later, they see kids vaping in the other restroom and report them. The result is suspensions and an expulsion. The author is upset because the kids are young (14-15) and maybe they didn't realize the consequences.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's actions led to disciplinary actions. The school had already taken steps by closing a restroom, but the problem continued. The author took it upon themselves to report the students, which is a form of whistleblowing. But was it justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules and helping the school address vaping. On the other hand, the kids are young and might not realize the seriousness. The author might have overstepped by not giving the students a chance to correct their behavior, maybe leading to harsh consequences for minors who are still learning.\n\nBut the school's policy is to handle such incidents, so the author might not be in the wrong for reporting. However, the author's motivation was partly personal (inconvenience from having to walk) which could be a factor. But the main issue is the students breaking the rules. The school is responsible for enforcing discipline, so the author is just reporting an issue. But the question is about the author's responsibility. Did they have a duty to confront the students first or give them a warning? Since the author didn't do that and went straight to the authority, maybe they're being too harsh. However, the school might have policies in place that require immediate reporting. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's intent was to help fix the problem but ended up causing suspensions/expulsion. The ethical dilemma is about the consequences vs. the action. The answer depends on whether the author acted appropriately within the school's policies. If the school expects students to report violations directly, then the author is in the right. If the school prefers students to confront peers first, then maybe the author is in the wrong. Since the user didn't mention school policies, we have to assume they followed the correct procedure. However, the personal inconvenience might have influenced the action, which could be seen as problematic. \n\nBut the main issue is the students vaping, which is against school rules. The author is fulfilling their responsibility to report. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the fact that the kids are young and the author didn't confront them first might tip it to A. But the school is responsible for discipline, not the students. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. So Answer B.\n"
