So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The person is conflicted because they feel their actions were justified in exposing the problem but are upset because the students were all freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. The school closed a restroom instead of punishing the students, which the author found unfair. Then, when the author saw more students vaping in the other restroom, they reported it to the resource officer. The key point here is whether the author had a right or duty to report the incident. \n\nThe user says they don't have a problem with vaping itself but disapprove of doing it at school to impress peers. So the author's motivation was based on the students violating school rules, not necessarily the act of vaping itself. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors would be intent, the age of the students, and the consequences. The author's intention was to stop a violation, but by reporting the group, they led to severe punishments. However, the students were aware of the rules and chose to break them. The author didn't lie or exaggerate; they came forward when they saw an infraction. \n\nBut maybe the author could have approached the situation differently. For example, confronting the students first or informing a teacher without directly leading to an intervention. However, the scenario states that the author didn't say anything to the students and immediately reported the incident upon seeing the resource officer. \n\nThe school is responsible for enforcing rules, and even if the students are young, they are still expected to follow the rules. The author's action might have been a valid exercise of their responsibility as a student to report violations. However, the outcome was harsh, so some might argue the punishment was excessive for juveniles, but the author's role is about reporting, not determining the punishment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as taking justice into their own hands by not giving the students a chance to correct their behavior. But again, the school's role is to handle such matters. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was to report a known violation, which is generally considered right. The fact that the students were young might evoke sympathy, but the school's policies are in place for a reason. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
