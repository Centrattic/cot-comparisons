So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which annoyed the author because now they have to walk farther. Then, when the author saw a group of kids vaping in another restroom, they told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is now feeling guilty because the kids were young (freshmen) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The school has a policy against vaping, and the students were breaking those rules. The author reported them, which led to enforcement. But the author might have mixed motives here. They were upset about the restroom closure affecting them, so maybe they took it out on the other students. Is that justified? \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself, but with the students doing it to impress peers. However, the school's rules are in place regardless of the students' reasons. The author's action led to consequences, but the question is whether reporting them is wrong. \n\nThe author might have overreacted because they were frustrated. But is it their responsibility to enforce school rules? If someone is breaking rules, isn't reporting them the right thing to do? However, the author might have targeted these kids because of their own annoyance, which could be seen as vindictive. Also, the outcome is severe (expulsion of a kid with a history), which makes the author feel bad. \n\nSo, considering intent and consequences: if the author's main reason was to get back at the school for closing the restroom, then that's wrong. But if they genuinely wanted to enforce the rules despite their own inconvenience, maybe not. The line here is whether the action was a justified report or an act of revenge. The story says they told the officer because they saw it happening, but their initial frustration might have influenced their decision. \n\nIn schools, students are supposed to report violations. But when it's done out of spite, it's problematic. The author might be in the wrong if their action was more about getting back at the school or the kids rather than upholding the rules. However, it's also possible that they acted correctly, and the school's response was too harsh. But the question is about the author's actions, not the school's. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did they have a valid reason to report? The school's policy is against vaping, so yes. But was their motive inappropriate? The frustration might be a red flag. Maybe they should have reported the initial restroom closures not working instead of taking it out on others. But they did report a violation, which is technically correct. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. If the person is in the wrong, it's because they used their frustration to target others. If not, because they followed the rules. I think the answer depends on whether the intent was malicious. Since the author didn't confront the kids first and just reported them, maybe that's not the issue. But the fact that they were annoyed by the restroom closure and took action against others shows a vindictive motive. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
