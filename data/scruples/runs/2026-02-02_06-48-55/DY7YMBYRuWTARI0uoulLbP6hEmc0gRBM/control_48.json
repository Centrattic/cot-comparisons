So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves reporting students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because now they have to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, they see more students vaping in another bathroom and report them. \n\nThe key points here are the age of the students (14-15 year olds) and the author's motivation. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the students are doing it to please their peers. The author's main issue was the inconvenience of the closed bathroom, which led them to report others. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the students were breaking school rules, so reporting them isn't inherently wrong. However, the author's primary motivation seems to be personal inconvenience rather than genuine concern for the students' actions. Also, the consequences were severe (expulsion), which might be too harsh for the offense, especially for minors. \n\nThe author might have considered talking to an authority first before taking action, but they chose to report directly. While the action led to suspensions, the ethical aspect hinges on intent and the fairness of the punishment. The author could be seen as using the situation to vent their frustration about the closed bathroom, which might be inconsiderate towards the students' ages and circumstances. \n\nSo, there's a mix of factors. The action itself isn't wrong, but the reasoning and potential over-punishment might make the author at fault. However, others might argue that they were upholding school rules. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the motivation and the severity of the consequences.\n"
