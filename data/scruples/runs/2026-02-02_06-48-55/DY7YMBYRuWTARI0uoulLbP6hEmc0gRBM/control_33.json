So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves them reporting students vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem persisted. The author, frustrated by having to walk farther for the bathroom, saw more students vaping in another restroom and reported them. The consequences were severe for the students involved, including an expulsion.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the issue, they reported the incident without directly confronting the students, and the students were freshmen around 14-15 years old. The author feels bad because they think the kids are still learning and the punishment might be too harsh.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, reporting illegal or prohibited activities to authorities is usually the right thing to do. Vaping in school is against the rules, so the students were violating policies. The author didn't confront them but informed the resource officer, which is a proper channel.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was partly due to personal inconvenience (having to walk farther). They might be projecting their frustration onto the situation. But even so, preventing others from breaking rules is generally considered responsible behavior. The fact that they didn't confront the students but went to the resource officer shows they used the correct procedure.\n\nThe question is about moral responsibility. While the author might not be in the wrong for reporting, some might argue that they should have tried to address the issue differently, like talking to the students or a teacher first. But given the school's prior inaction (just closing the restroom instead of addressing the root cause), the author's action could be seen as trying to enforce the rules the school didn't.\n\nThe students were indeed breaking the rules, so the author isn't complicit in the wrongdoing. However, the severity of the punishment (expulsion) is up to the school's policies. The author doesn't have control over that. Their role was to report, not to determine the consequences.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the violation. They acted within their rights to inform authorities about students breaking school rules. The frustration with the school's approach is understandable, but their action was a valid response.\n"
