So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a restroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. \n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, when they saw more students vaping in another restroom, they told the resource officer, resulting in consequences for the students involved.\n\nThe key points here are: the students were breaking school rules by vaping. The author didn't confront them directly but informed the authorities. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following school rules by reporting the violation. The students were doing something prohibited, so reporting them could be seen as responsible. However, the author might be taking on a role of authority that isn't theirs, potentially leading to harsh consequences for minors. The author mentions feeling bad because the students are young and might not understand the implications.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author justified in reporting if they were just following the rules? Or did they overstep by not addressing the issue directly with the students first? Also, the school's initial response (closing the restroom) might have contributed to the problem, but that's more about the school's policy.\n\nThe author's motivation is a mix of frustration with the school's handling and personal inconvenience. The action taken was reporting the incident, which is typically the right thing to do. However, the outcome was severe (expulsion), which might make the author question their role. \n\nBut legally and ethically, students are supposed to report violations. The school has the authority to enforce rules, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting. The students were still breaking the rules regardless of the author's actions. The author's intent wasn't to get others in trouble but to address a problem they were facing.\n\nOn the flip side, if the author's main issue was their own inconvenience, that might affect their judgment. But the story doesn't say they were seeking revenge; they just wanted to address the vaping. The fact that they didn't confront the students first but went straight to the authorities could be seen as bypassing social resolution, but in a school setting, authority figures are the proper channel.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they reported a policy violation to the appropriate authority. The consequences are up to the school, and the author's action was within their right. However, there's a nuance about the severity of the punishment versus the action taken. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing, not the school's. So the answer is B (No).\n"
