So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a high school closing a restroom due to students vaping there, which made the author have to walk to the other side of the school. Then, when the author saw more students vaping in the other restroom, they reported it to the resource officer, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the students were freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The school closed a restroom to prevent vaping, but it didn't stop the problem. The author, frustrated because they have to walk far to use the bathroom, decides to report others vaping. The key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author claims they aren't against vaping but are upset about the students doing it to impress peers. So their motivation is not to harm the kids but to address the school's policy enforcement. \n\nHowever, the action led to severe punishments. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know beforehand that one of the kids would be expelled. They just wanted to report the issue, thinking the school might take action. But since the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences, the author is conflicted. \n\nI should consider if the author had a duty to inform the resource officer directly or if their approach was appropriate. Since the school already closed a restroom, maybe the author thought there was a lack of enforcement. By reporting, they might be trying to hold the school accountable. But the outcome was harsh, especially for a freshman. \n\nOn the other hand, the school's rules are in place for a reason, and the author is following them by reporting the violation. The author might not be responsible for the school's decision to expel someone. But the author's frustration could have led them to act without considering the kids' ages or the severity of the punishment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did report the violation, which is within their rights. The school's response is their responsibility. The author's intent was to stop the vaping, not to get kids expelled. However, the author might have overstepped by being an active participant in busting them, especially if they didn't know the full context of previous infractions. \n\nBut the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The main factor is intent. If the author's intent was to enforce the rules and stop the vaping, then they might not be at fault. The school's actions are a separate issue. However, if the author acted out of spite or to get revenge because of their personal inconvenience, that could be a problem. \n\nThe original post says the author was \"pissed\" because the school didn't fix the problem and they had to walk far. Then, when they saw the vaping again, they decided to report. The author's reasoning is that the school isn't addressing the issue, so they took matters into their own hands. \n\nIn school settings, students are expected to follow rules, and reporting violations is generally acceptable. However, the author's frustration might have led to a knee-jerk reaction. But the school's punishment (expulsion) is a result of their own policies and the frequency of the student's infractions, not just the author's report. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author is acting within their rights to report a school rule violation. The school's response is their decision, and the author's intent was to address the problem, not to maliciously harm the students. However, there might be some nuance in how they went about it, like confronting the kids directly, but the main action of reporting is justified. The author feeling bad is understandable, but they aren't in the wrong for following the rules and informing the authorities.\n"
