So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels conflicted because they think the school didn't fix the problem by closing a restroom, and they ended up getting the kids in trouble.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's main complaint is that the school shut down a restroom instead of addressing the vaping issue. Then, when they saw more students vaping in another restroom, they reported them. The author isn't against vaping per se but against the students doing it at school for peer approval. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to uphold school rules and prevent underage vaping, which is a legitimate concern. Vaping is illegal for minors, and schools have policies against it. So reporting it could be seen as the right thing to do. However, the author's motivation is also about personal inconvenience (needing to walk farther to the restroom). That might cloud their judgment, as they might be acting out of frustration rather than purely doing the right thing.\n\nNext, the consequences are significant: suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the students are young (14-15 years old). At that age, students might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The author's action led to harsh penalties, which might be seen as overly punitive, especially if the school has a history of not enforcing rules strictly before (like just closing the restroom instead of punishing the students).\n\nThe key points here are intent, proportionality of the response, and the impact on others. The author intended to stop the behavior, which is a positive intent. However, the method involved snitching on their peers, leading to severe consequences. This could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the school's prior approach was lenient. The author might be taking the law into their own hands by snitching, which can create a hostile environment where students don't trust each other.\n\nAdditionally, the author's personal frustration with the restroom closure might have influenced their decision to report the students. That introduces an element of self-interest. If the author had only focused on the health or safety issues related to vaping, their action might be more justified. But since their main issue was the inconvenience, it complicates the moral standing.\n\nAnother angle is whether the school's response (closing the restroom) was appropriate. If the school failed to enforce rules and instead took a passive approach, the students might feel it's acceptable to continue. The author stepping in to report could be seen as necessary to maintain the rules. But again, the harshness of the punishment and the age of the students are factors. Expelling a student for repeated offenses might be justified, but others might argue that the school should have handled it through other means first, like counseling or education.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between doing the right thing and the potential harm caused. The author's action led to suspensions and an expulsion, which are serious. If the author didn't consider the consequences for the students, they might be in the wrong. However, if they believed the school was not doing its job, their action could be seen as a necessary step to enforce rules.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their primary motivation was personal inconvenience rather than the welfare of the students. Also, the harsh consequences might not be justified if the author didn't consider the school's role in addressing the issue. However, there's a counterargument that they're reporting a violation of school policy. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because of the personal motive and the negative impact on the students.\n"
