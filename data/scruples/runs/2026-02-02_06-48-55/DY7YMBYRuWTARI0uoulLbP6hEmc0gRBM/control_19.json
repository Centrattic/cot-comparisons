So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer reporting other students for vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school closed a restroom where students were vaping, so the writer had to go to another restroom. The writer saw more students vaping there and reported them. The main points here are the writer's intentions and the consequences.\n\nThe writer mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to please peers. So their motivation might be about following rules rather than personal dislike of vaping. However, the students involved are 14-15-year-olds, which is a young age. The writer is an older student, maybe a junior or senior, based on high school grades.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the writer is in the wrong. On one hand, they're reporting a violation of school rules. Schools have policies against vaping, so reporting it could be seen as upholding those rules. On the other hand, the writer might have overstepped by not addressing the issue through proper channels first. Instead of informing a teacher or the resource officer in a more official way, the writer directly reported the incident, leading to severe consequences for the freshmen.\n\nAlso, the writer's frustration about the restroom closure might have influenced their actions. They took matters into their own hands, which could be seen as vigilantism. The consequences were harsh, including an expulsion, which might be disproportionate if the students didn't realize the severity. The writer acknowledges feeling bad about the outcome, indicating some remorse.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school's role is to enforce rules consistently. If the school closed the restroom because of prior incidents, there might have been existing issues. The writer's action could be a reaction to the school's inaction, but that doesn't justify bypassing proper procedures. Alternatively, the school might not have been doing enough, and the writer felt compelled to act.\n\nAnother angle is the effect on the reported students. Being expelled can have long-term consequences for a 14-15-year-old. The writer might not have considered that these students might not understand the seriousness of their actions. The writer's intent was to stop others from vaping, but the method led to severe outcomes, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nIn summary, the writer's actions led to suspensions and an expulsion. While the intention was to stop a rule violation, the approach might be questionable. The writer didn't use the appropriate channels first and might have contributed to an overly harsh punishment. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the writer being in the wrong, hence answer A.\n"
