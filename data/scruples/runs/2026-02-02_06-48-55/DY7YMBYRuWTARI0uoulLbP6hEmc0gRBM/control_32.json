So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe context is a high school where a restroom was closed because students were vaping there. The author is upset about the inconvenience because they have to go to the other side of the school now. Then, when they see a group of kids vaping in the other bathroom, they report them. As a result, several kids get suspended and one gets expelled. The author is conflicted because these are freshmen, 14-15 years old, and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is about the school's handling of the problem. They closed the restroom instead of addressing the root issue. The author, frustrated by this, decides to take action by reporting the students they see vaping. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the school has rules against vaping, then students are violating them. The school has the authority to enforce these rules, and students are supposed to follow them. By reporting the violation, the author is technically helping enforce the rules. However, there's a moral component here. The author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it at school to impress peers. The author might feel it's unfair because the school didn't address the problem properly and just closed a restroom, leading to the same issue in another place.\n\nBut the author's decision to report the students led to suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether the author overstepped. The school is responsible for enforcing their policies, and the students are accountable for their actions. If the author reported a legitimate violation, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they acted out of personal spite or took it too far, that could be a problem. The author's frustration with the school's actions might have influenced their decision to report, possibly leading to harsh consequences for the students.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront the students directly but immediately reported them to an authority. That could be seen as a responsible action. However, the author's motivation was personal inconvenience, which might not justify the outcome. Also, considering the students are young and maybe not fully understanding the consequences, the author might feel guilty about their role in such severe punishments.\n\nBut the school's responsibility is to maintain discipline. If the author is a student, they might feel conflicted about taking action that leads to peers being expelled. The school has the authority to decide punishments, so even if the author is part of the process, they aren't the one deciding the punishment. The students are still responsible for their actions, so the author isn't directly responsible for the expulsion.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue through the proper channels first, like talking to a teacher or administrator, instead of immediately reporting them. But in some cases, students do report incidents directly if they witness them. The school's policy might allow that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions led to consequences, if the students were indeed violating school rules, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But there's a moral aspect where the author might feel conflicted about contributing to the suspension/expulsion of peers, especially younger students. However, legally and according to school policies, the author is probably not in the wrong.\n"
