So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them getting multiple kids suspended and one expelled for vaping in school.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they now have to walk farther to use the bathroom. Then they went to the other bathroom and saw more kids vaping. Instead of ignoring it, the author told the school resource officer, which led to disciplinary actions. The author feels bad because the kids are freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author didn't like the school's initial approach of just closing a restroom without addressing the root problem. They took it upon themselves to report the ongoing vaping, which they felt was a problem. But they also admit that the kids are young and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. Legally, students are supposed to follow school rules, and vaping is against most school policies. By reporting the violations, the author is enforcing the existing rules. However, the author's motivation was partly about their own inconvenience (having to walk farther) and frustration with the school's handling of the issue. \n\nThe moral angle comes into play. The author might feel justified in stopping rule-breakers, but the outcome was harsh penalties for minors. The school's responsibility is to educate and guide students, not just punish. If the resource officer's response was disproportionately severe, maybe the school's approach is part of the problem. However, the author's action was to report what they saw, which is a civic duty. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of whether the author should have handled it differently. Maybe they could have first talked to a teacher or administrator instead of immediately involving law enforcement. However, the school resource officer is part of the school's staff, so reporting to them is appropriate.\n\nIn some cases, whistleblowing or reporting wrongdoing is seen as right, even if it has negative consequences. However, the author may not have considered the impact on the students. But again, the students were breaking rules, and the school's job is to enforce them.\n\nThe author's own admission that they don't dislike vaping per se but disapprove of the kids doing it to please peers adds nuance. They might be acting with good intentions, wanting to prevent others from engaging in behavior they consider inappropriate.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the school's procedures by reporting the issue to the appropriate authority. The school's severe punishment is the result of their own policies, not the author's report. However, there's a possible argument that the author should have considered the school's existing measures before taking action. But given the context, their action seems justified.\n"
