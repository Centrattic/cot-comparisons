So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting several students suspended and one expelled after reporting them for vaping in a bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they now had to walk a long way. Then, they saw a group of students vaping in another bathroom and reported them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young (14-15) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting. Let's break it down. On one hand, the school has rules against vaping, and breaking them can lead to disciplinary actions. The author is following the rules by reporting illegal activity. On the other hand, the author might have been motivated by personal inconvenience (not liking the closure) and didn't directly confront the vapers but immediately went to the officer. Also, the expelled kid had prior offenses, which might be a factor in the severity.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, if they're following school policy and reporting a violation, maybe they're in the right. However, their motivation was partly about their own frustration, not just upholding rules. Also, the action led to severe consequences, especially for the expelled student. But the author didn't know about the prior offenses. The question is whether they overstepped by not addressing the issue directly first, like talking to the students or maybe informing the school through a proper channel instead of immediately calling the officer. However, the school's policy might require immediate reporting. If the author was within their rights and followed the correct procedure, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they acted out of spite or without considering the students' circumstances, then maybe they are. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer depends on whether the action was justified under school rules and the intent behind it. If the author's intent was to enforce the rules regardless of personal inconvenience, then justified. If it's about getting back at the school or venting frustration, then maybe not. Since the author says they don't have a problem with vaping but the students are doing it to please peers, their motivation could be seen as helping prevent bad behavior. But the outcome was harsh. Hmm.\n"
