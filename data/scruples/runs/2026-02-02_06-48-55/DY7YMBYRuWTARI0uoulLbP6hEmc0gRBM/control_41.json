So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they had to walk further to the bathroom. Then, they saw more kids vaping in the other restroom and told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young.\n\nHmm, the key points here are: was the author's action justified? They didn't do it for personal gain but because the school wasn't addressing the problem. However, they admit they didn't say anything to the vapers themselves and just reported them. The kids are 14-15, which is a developing age. \n\nBut the school rules prohibit vaping, so if they were caught, the school has to enforce the rules. The author might have done the right thing by reporting, even if they were annoyed. However, maybe they could have approached it differently, like talking to the students first. But in some cases, schools require immediate reporting. \n\nThe author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the issue. They might not be in the wrong because they're following the rules, but it's possible that they could have handled it with more empathy. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since they reported a violation, maybe they're not wrong. But considering the age of the kids and the author's possible lack of awareness about their intentions, there might be some nuance. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is following school policies and addressing a problem. But the emotions here are mixed. The user feels bad, but the action was technically correct. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
