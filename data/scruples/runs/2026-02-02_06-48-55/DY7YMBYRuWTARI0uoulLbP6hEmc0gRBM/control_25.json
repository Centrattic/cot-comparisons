So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that their school shut down a bathroom because kids were vaping in there. The author is upset because they now have to walk across the school to the bathroom. Then they see a group of kids vaping in the other bathroom and report it, leading to suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The school closed a bathroom because of repeated vaping incidents, which is a school policy issue. The author is frustrated because they have to walk farther, but they don't disapprove of vaping itself. However, they report the kids, thinking that the school should address the problem. The result is serious consequences for the students, including expulsion, which the author now regrets because the kids are young and might not realize the impact of their actions.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Let's consider their motivations. They wanted to address the problem that the school didn't fix by closing the bathroom. Reporting the kids was their way of taking action. But is that their responsibility? Maybe they overstepped by involving the resource officer. Also, the author didn't confront the kids directly but immediately reported them, leading to harsh consequences. The school's policy enforcement is supposed to handle such situations, so maybe the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves. However, the act of reporting illegal or policy-violating behavior isn't inherently wrong. The school is supposed to enforce rules, so the author might have done their part. But the consequences were severe, and the author now feels bad about it.\n\nAnother angle: the author's frustration with the inconvenience caused them to act. Was their motivation purely to fix the problem, or was there some personal annoyance involved? If the latter, maybe that's where the issue lies. But even so, the students were breaking the rules. The school's decision to close the bathroom was a response to the problem, but it didn't stop the behavior, so the author took matters into their own hands. The question is whether that's appropriate. In schools, students are supposed to report misconduct, but the severity of the punishment is up to the school. The author didn't know the full story of the kids' circumstances, so maybe they didn't consider that.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping per se but with the fact that it's happening at school for peer approval. So it's about breaking the rules, not the act itself. Reporting rule-breaking is generally expected, but leading to expulsions might be beyond their control. The school's decision to expel is separate from the author's report, so maybe they aren't responsible for the severity. However, the author might still feel they contributed to harsh outcomes without considering the kids' ages and lack of judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were to report a violation, which is a right and responsibility. However, their lack of consideration for the consequences and the kids' ages might make them feel like they're in the wrong. But legally and ethically, reporting is correct. The school's punishment is their responsibility. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but the author's personal feelings of regret complicate it. Alternatively, if the school's approach was too harsh, the author's role in that might be seen as wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the school. So the author did what was expected by reporting, so they're not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
