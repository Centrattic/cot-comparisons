So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting multiple students suspended and one expelled by reporting vaping in the bathroom. The author was frustrated because the school closed a restroom instead of addressing the root issue, and when they saw students vaping in the remaining restroom, they reported them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. Vaping is typically against school rules, so the students were technically violating the code. The author didn't do anything illegal by reporting them. But maybe the author's motivation is a factor. They were annoyed about having to walk farther to the bathroom, so they took action. That could be seen as using the situation for personal gain or spite, which might be morally questionable.\n\nThe other angle is the consequences. The kids are freshmen, 14-15 years old. The expelled kid had prior violations. The author might feel bad because they didn't realize the severity of the actions, but they knew the kids were violating rules. The school's response was strict, but that's up to the school's discretion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't break any rules themselves, but their intent might be seen as petty. However, they did report illegal activity. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say they're not in the wrong because they upheld the rules, while others might think they acted out of spite. The key points are intent and the impact on others. The author's action led to expulsion, which is a serious consequence. But they might not be at fault since they followed the rules. Hmm.\n"
