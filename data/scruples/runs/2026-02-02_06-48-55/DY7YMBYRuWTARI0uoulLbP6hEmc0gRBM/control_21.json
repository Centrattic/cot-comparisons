So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which the author found unfair because they have to walk farther now. When they saw more vaping in another restroom, they told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to address the vaping they found unacceptable. But they caused consequences for the kids involved. The question is whether their actions were wrong. \n\nThe author doesn't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. However, by reporting the group, they led to disciplinary actions. The expelled student had prior violations, so maybe that's a separate factor.\n\nThe moral dilemma here is about whether the author overstepped by snitching, especially since they felt the initial punishment (closing the restroom) didn't address the problem. But the author's action directly caused the suspensions. The kids are young, so the author might feel guilt about their actions affecting them harshly.\n\nBut legally and according to school rules, vaping is prohibited, so reporting it isn't inherently wrong. However, the ethical aspect is about the impact. The author might be seen as a tattletale, but they could also be trying to enforce rules. The fact that they felt conflicted about the harsh consequences adds complexity. \n\nThe school's initial response (closing the bathroom) was a preventive measure, but the author's action was reactive. The line between right and wrong here is blurry. The author's intent was to solve the problem they found, but their method led to severe outcomes. Depending on perspective, they might be in the wrong for not considering the consequences on the students, especially since they're young. Alternatively, they're just following the rules. \n\nIn some views, the author is justified in reporting the violation. In others, they're causing unnecessary harm. The answer likely depends on the emphasis on the school's rules versus the students' youth and the proportionality of the punishment. Given that the expelled student had prior issues, maybe the author isn't fully responsible for that outcome. But the suspensions of others might be seen as the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (wrong) because they caused harm to peers, but B (not wrong) because they reported a violation. However, the community might judge based on intent and consequences. The Reddit AITA (Am I the Asshole) often considers intent and whether the person acted in bad faith. Here, the author acted in good faith but caused unintended consequences. \n\nThe key is whether the action was malicious. Since the author didn't have a vendetta and was following rules, but felt the initial school action was inadequate, they might be seen as not the asshole. But some could argue they should have talked to an adult first instead of directly reporting. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were in line with school policy, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
