So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person who wrote this is a high school student, probably a bit older since they mention being near a restroom for most of the day. The situation is about vaping in the school, leading to a restroom being closed. The student is upset because they now have to walk farther to use the bathroom.\n\nThen, they see a group of freshmen vaping in another restroom and report them. The result is several suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the victims are young, 14-15 years old, and maybe they didn't realize the consequences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me consider different angles. On one hand, they're reporting illegal activity (vaping is against school rules), which is technically the right thing to do. Schools have rules for a reason, and students are supposed to follow them. If the author is following the rules by reporting, they might be in the right. But maybe there's nuance here.\n\nBut then, the author might have had a motive of personal inconvenience. They were annoyed because the restroom closure affected them, so they decided to take action against others. That could imply a personal vendetta or using the situation to get back at the school for closing the restroom. However, the act itself was to report wrongdoing, which is usually seen as positive.\n\nThe expelled kid had multiple offenses, which the school might have handled differently if not for this incident. The author didn't know that at the time. Also, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to fit in. So the motivation was to stop others from breaking rules, not to target them for vaping in itself.\n\nBut then, the question is whether the author overstepped. Reporting is a form of whistleblowing, which is encouraged. However, if the author used this as a way to retaliate against the school's decision, maybe that's a different story. Alternatively, they might have just done the right thing by following school procedures when they saw a violation.\n\nAnother point: the students were freshmen, young and might not fully understand the consequences. The author could have felt conflicted about their actions because of that. But the school's role is to enforce rules regardless of the students' age in some cases. If the school is strict about vaping, then the author's report is in line with that policy.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author didn't try to address the root issue, like talking to an authority about the restroom closure leading to more vaping, instead of targeting others. Maybe the author should have worked with the school to find a better solution rather than reporting peers.\n\nBut the author's main grievance was the inconvenience caused by the restroom closure. Their action was to report others for breaking rules, which is within their right. Unless there was coercion or a deliberate plan to get the kids in trouble without cause, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a personal motive (frustration with the restroom closure), the act itself was reporting a violation of school rules. Unless there's evidence of malicious intent, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
