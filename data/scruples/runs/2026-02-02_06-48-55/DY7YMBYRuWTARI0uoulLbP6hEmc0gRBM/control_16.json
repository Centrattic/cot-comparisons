So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to several suspensions and one expulsion. The writer is conflicted because the students were only 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. The school closed a restroom because of vaping incidents, but the problem continued. The writer reported another instance, which led to consequences. The key points here are about the writer's intent and the consequences. \n\nThe writer mentions they were annoyed by the restroom closure and wanted to address the ongoing issue. They didn't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students breaking school rules. However, the result was suspensions and an expulsion of minors. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is at fault. Legally, students can report misconduct, and the school has the authority to enforce rules. However, the writer might be in the wrong if they knew the situation might lead to harsh consequences without considering the severity for minors. But on the other hand, they followed school procedures by informing an authority figure. \n\nFactors to consider: Was the writer trying to fix a problem they were affected by? Did they overstep by causing disciplinary actions? The school's response might be seen as strict, but the students were violating rules. The writer didn't physically harm anyone, just reported the incident. \n\nBut the writer's motivation was personal inconvenience (having to walk farther to the restroom) and maybe a desire to enforce rules. However, the outcome affected minors who might not fully understand the consequences. The writer might have acted without considering the impact on the students, which could make them responsible for the harsh outcomes. \n\nIn some ethical frameworks, intent matters. If the writer's intent was to help the school address a problem, it's less blameworthy. If it was out of spite or personal annoyance, then more so. The post says they were mad about the restroom closure, which could indicate personal motivation. \n\nAlso, the school's policy might require students to report violations, so the writer was following that. But if the school's policy is too harsh, the writer might inadvertently cause harm. However, as a student, they aren't responsible for the school's disciplinary actions; they just reported a violation. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer might not be in the wrong since they reported a violation, but there's a gray area if their intent was more self-serving. The answer could be \"B\" (not in the wrong) because they followed school rules, even if the consequences were severe.\n"
