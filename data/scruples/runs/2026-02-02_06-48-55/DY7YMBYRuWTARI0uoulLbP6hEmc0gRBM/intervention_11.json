So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school where a restroom was closed due to students vaping there. The author, frustrated by having to walk farther to the bathroom, then sees more students vaping in another restroom and reports them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a policy against vaping, then the students were indeed breaking the rules. The author's actions led to enforcement of those rules. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping per se, but rather the students doing it at school to impress peers. However, the act itself is against school policy. By reporting the incident, the author is following the rules. But the consequences were severe\u2014suspensions and expulsion. The author feels bad because the students involved are freshmen, young teenagers who might not realize the consequences.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? They didn't create the policy; they enforced it. But maybe they could have handled it differently. For example, reporting to an authority instead of directly confronting the students. But the author didn't confront them; they informed the resource officer. The main issue is whether reporting the violation is wrong. \n\nThe school's closure of a restroom was a preventive measure, but it didn't stop the problem. The author's action addressed the ongoing issue. However, the severity of the punishment (expulsion) might be a point of contention. The author might feel responsible for the harsh consequences, even though they were following the rules.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author was just doing the right thing by upholding school policies. Others might say that the author should have considered the impact on the students, especially since they are young. But legally and according to school rules, the author is in the right. However, morally, some might question if snitching on peers is appropriate, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just moral judgment.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they reported a school policy violation, which is their duty. The school's decision to punish severely is their responsibility, not the reporter's. The author's frustration with the initial closure led them to take action, which is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
