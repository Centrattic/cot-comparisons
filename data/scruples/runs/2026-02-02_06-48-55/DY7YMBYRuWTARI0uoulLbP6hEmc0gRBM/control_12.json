So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves getting several students suspended and one expelled after reporting a group vaping in a bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk to the other side of the school. Then, they saw more students vaping in the other bathroom, didn't confront them, but called the resource officer. This led to suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the students were freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's intent and actions. They reported the students, which led to severe consequences. The author argues that the school wasn't solving the problem by just closing a bathroom and that they wanted to address the ongoing issue. But they also mention not being against vaping itself, just the students doing it to impress peers.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, legally, if the school has rules against vaping, students are violating them, and the author is reporting the violation, they might be acting within school policy. However, the ethical aspect is trickier. The author didn't confront the students directly but immediately reported them, leading to harsh consequences. The fact that they're freshmen who might not fully understand the repercussions could be a factor. Also, the author's motivation might be partly revenge for the inconvenience caused by the closed bathroom.\n\nIn some cases, reporting wrongdoing is the right thing to do. But if the author's actions were more about spite or not considering the students' youth and the severity of the punishment, that could be seen as wrong. The school's approach to closing a bathroom without addressing the root cause might contribute to the problem, but the author's own actions in reporting the students without trying to handle the situation differently (like talking to a teacher first) might be questioned. \n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the author should have considered the consequences for the students. Expulsion is a serious action, and if the students have prior offenses, the school might have followed protocol. However, the author's role in escalating the situation could be seen as contributing to the problem rather than solving it.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might depend on the intent. If the author's main goal was to uphold school rules, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the actions were more about personal frustration and led to disproportionate consequences, then they could be in the wrong. The Reddit community often considers intentions and outcomes in these \"Am I the Asshole?\" posts. Since the author felt conflicted about the outcomes, especially affecting minors, that might tip the scale towards them being in the wrong.\n"
