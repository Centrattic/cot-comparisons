So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a high school student who, after being inconvenienced by a closed restroom due to vaping incidents, decides to report a group of students vaping in another restroom. This leads to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The school closed a restroom due to repeated vaping violations by students, mostly freshmen. The author is frustrated because they have to walk farther, so when they see students vaping in another restroom, they report it. The consequences are severe for the students involved, including an expulsion for a repeat offender.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. The author's intention was to address the problem they found annoying. However, they didn't confront the vapers directly but instead informed the authorities, leading to disciplinary actions. The key here is whether the author overstepped by taking it upon themselves to solve the issue, resulting in harsh penalties for minors.\n\nLegal aspects: Tattling isn't illegal per se. However, the ethical side is more complex. The author didn't engage in confrontation or violence but used the school system's procedures to report the incident. The school's role is to enforce rules, and students are allowed to report violations. However, the author's motivation was personal inconvenience rather than a genuine concern for the school's policy. This could be seen as using the system for personal gain instead of the school's benefit.\n\nMoral considerations: The author acknowledges feeling bad about the outcome, especially since the students are young. The expelled student had prior violations, so the school might have had grounds for expulsion regardless. The author might have contributed to a zero-tolerance approach without understanding the context of the students' actions or their prior records.\n\nAnother angle is the school's responsibility. If the school didn't enforce rules consistently before closing the restroom, the author's report might have exposed a gap in enforcement. However, the school's decision to close the restroom instead of addressing the root cause (vaping) could be seen as ineffective, and the author's action might have been a reaction to that.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the action was justified by the school's rules and the students were indeed violating them, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting. However, if the action was taken for personal reasons (annoyance at having to walk farther) rather than a genuine effort to uphold school policy, it might be considered wrong. Also, the author didn't attempt to resolve the issue through appropriate channels first, like talking to teachers or administrators, but instead took direct action that led to severe consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author reported a violation, the motivation and the resulting consequences on minors might make them responsible for overreacting. The ethical dilemma here is between upholding rules and showing leniency for young students. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because their primary motivation was personal inconvenience, leading to harsh outcomes for the students.\n"
