So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves them reporting a group of students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. Vaping is typically against school policies, so the students were violating the rules. The writer found them and reported them to the resource officer. That action led to consequences for the students. The writer's main argument is that they were frustrated with the school's previous inaction (closing a restroom instead of addressing the root issue) and wanted to do something about it. They feel bad because the students are young and maybe not fully aware of the consequences.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the writer act correctly? Reporting illegal or prohibited activities is generally seen as a responsible action, especially if the school isn't handling it. However, there's a possibility of the writer being a tattletale, which some might see as snitching. But since the students were violating school policies, the writer's intent was to enforce the rules the school wasn't properly enforcing.\n\nThe writer mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. This might indicate they're not targeting vaping in general but the misuse on school grounds. The outcome was harsh (expulsion), so the writer feels guilty it affected young kids. However, the school's policies likely dictate those consequences, so the writer isn't responsible for the severity of the punishment.\n\nIs the writer at fault? They took action within the school's policy framework. They might have overstepped by not addressing it directly to authorities first, but since they did report to the resource officer, that's the appropriate channel. The problem could be that the school's approach (closing the restroom) was flawed, but the writer's action was to report the violation. So, while the writer might feel guilty, from a policy standpoint, they weren't in the wrong. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the school's policies are clear against vaping, then reporting is right. But some might argue snitching on peers is wrong, which is a social issue. But legally and by school rules, they're probably in the right.\n\nSo answer B (not in the wrong) seems correct.\n"
