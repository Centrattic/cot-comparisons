So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported others vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the author found another bathroom with more students vaping. They told the resource officer, resulting in multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are freshmen (14-15) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The school has rules against vaping, right? The students are violating those rules. The author reported them, which is a form of whistleblowing. But since they're peers, maybe there's an element of snitching. \n\nIn schools, there's often a culture where students might not report peers to avoid being seen as a snitch. However, the school's job is to enforce rules, and students can report violations. The author's action led to consequences, which they now feel guilty about because the kids were young and maybe didn't understand the seriousness.\n\nBut legally and ethically, is the author wrong? They didn't participate in the vaping; they reported it. The school's resource officer handled the situation. The problem is that the author might have acted out of personal frustration (since the bathroom closure inconvenienced them) rather than purely to enforce the rules. However, even if there's some personal motive, the act itself of reporting a rule violation isn't inherently wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue with a teacher or administrator first rather than directly confronting the situation. But the author did go to the resource officer, which is appropriate. \n\nThe fact that the kids were expelled might be seen as too harsh, but the author isn't responsible for the school's disciplinary actions. They just reported what they saw. The author's guilt comes from the outcome, not the act itself. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the act of reporting a violation isn't necessarily wrong. However, the context of peer relationships and the potential for harsh consequences might influence the perception. But legally, the author isn't in the wrong. The school's response is up to their discretion. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because reporting the violation is a responsible action, even if it leads to harsh consequences. The author is following the rules and allowing the authorities to handle the situation. The guilt they feel is personal but not a legal or ethical wrong.\n"
