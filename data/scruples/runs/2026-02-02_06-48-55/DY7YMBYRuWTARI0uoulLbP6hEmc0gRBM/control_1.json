So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who caused multiple suspensions and an expulsion by reporting students vaping in a bathroom. The school had already closed one restroom due to similar issues, and the author decided to report another group after being inconvenienced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a strict policy against vaping, then the students who were vaping were breaking the rules. The author didn't commit a crime by reporting them. However, the author is a student themselves, so their role in this is a bit complex. They had the choice to ignore the situation or report it. \n\nThe author's motivation was partly about the inconvenience of having to walk further to the bathroom. There's a question here about whether personal frustration influenced their decision. But from a moral standpoint, is it wrong to report illegal or policy-violating activities? Generally, no. However, the consequences were severe: one student was expelled. The author might feel bad because the students are young and maybe didn't realize the seriousness of their actions. \n\nBut the school's responsibility is to enforce rules. The author didn't fabricate the situation; they reported what they saw. So while the author might feel conflicted, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The school's actions are their own responsibility. The author acted within their rights, even if the outcome was harsh. \n\nAnother angle: was the author justified in using the school resource officer? If they saw students violating a rule, it's appropriate to report. The author didn't lie or exaggerate. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
