So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The high school closed a restroom because students, mostly freshmen, were vaping there. The author was upset because that bathroom was nearby, and now they have to walk to the other side of the school. Then, when they went to the other bathroom, they saw a group of kids vaping. The author didn't confront them but told the resource officer, resulting in suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, the school's decision to close the restroom is a disciplinary measure they might have taken to address the vaping problem. But the author is frustrated because it's causing them inconvenience. The author then sees more students vaping in another bathroom and reports them. The issue here is whether the author overstepped by reporting these students, especially since they admit they don't have a problem with vaping itself, just the fact that the students are doing it at school to impress peers.\n\nThe key points to consider: \n1. The school's policy on vaping. If it's against school rules, then reporting the students is within the author's right. But maybe the author is taking advantage of the rules for personal convenience rather than a genuine concern about the policy.\n2. The age of the students involved. They're 14-15, which is young, and the author feels bad about their punishment. However, if the school has clear rules, the author might not be responsible for the severity of the punishment.\n3. The author's motivation. They were annoyed by the inconvenience caused by the closed restroom and wanted to show that the problem still exists elsewhere. This could be seen as using the situation for personal satisfaction rather than a genuine effort to stop the behavior.\n4. The consequences: multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The author might be responsible if their action led to harsh consequences that the school might not have otherwise taken. But if the school's policy is strict, then the author might not be at fault for following through with the report.\n\nThe author's justification is that they're following the school's rules, but their motivation seems rooted in personal frustration. The question is whether the author has a responsibility to consider the impact on the students, especially given their age. However, the school's role is to enforce rules, and the author is a student with the right to report violations. The school's decision to expel one student is their responsibility, not the author's. So even if the author's actions caused the punishment, they might not be in the wrong as they're complying with the rules. However, if the author's intent was to retaliate or make life harder for others because of their own inconvenience, that's where the wrongdoing comes in.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront the students themselves, which could have been a more direct solution (like telling the staff without involving the police or leading to suspensions). Instead, they went to the resource officer and caused a bust. That might be seen as escalation beyond what's necessary, especially if the author was more interested in changing the school's policy (by showing the problem still exists) rather than addressing the immediate issue.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a reasonable report of a policy violation or an overreaction motivated by personal inconvenience. If the school's policy is clear and the author is just enforcing it, then they're not in the wrong. But if their primary motivation was self-serving (to make the school reconsider closing the restroom), then they are in the wrong. The author mentions they were upset about the inconvenience and that's why they took action. That suggests some self-interest, which could be a point against them. But the act of reporting is still within their rights. The school's harsh response (expulsion) is on the school's shoulders, not the author's. However, the author might have contributed to the problem by not trying to resolve it through other means first, like talking to the administration about the inconvenience instead of reporting the students. The author's choice to report rather than seek a solution might be the issue here.\n"
