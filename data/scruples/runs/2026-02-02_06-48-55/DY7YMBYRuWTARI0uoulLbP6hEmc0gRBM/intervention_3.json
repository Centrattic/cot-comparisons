So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author getting multiple students suspended and one expelled by informing a school resource officer about a group of kids vaping in a bathroom. The school had already closed another bathroom where similar incidents occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They went into the bathroom, saw the vaping, then reported it to the officer. The author didn't do anything violent or interfere with the students directly; just reported what they saw. The school's policy is to shut down restrooms instead of disciplining the students, so the author took it upon themselves to enforce the rules.\n\nThe main points of contention might be: 1) Was the author justified in reporting the students? 2) Were the consequences (expulsions, suspensions) too harsh? The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. The school's previous action was closing a restroom instead of punishing the students, which led to the author's frustration.\n\nThe author's defense is that they're trying to address a problem the school didn't handle. However, by reporting the students, they caused suspensions and an expulsion. The question is whether this was the right approach. \n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: They took it upon themselves to act as enforcers instead of reporting through proper channels, maybe not understanding the consequences. Also, expelling a student for repeated offenses might be the school's policy, but the author's action led to that. \n\nArguments against: The students were breaking school rules, and the author is doing the right thing by reporting them. The school's inaction led to the problem, and the author is trying to correct it.\n\nBut the author is a fellow student, so are they overstepping by taking this role? Also, the expelled student had been caught multiple times. The author might not be responsible for the school's disciplinary actions, just for reporting what they saw. However, if the school's policy is to expel, maybe the author's reporting led to that, which could be seen as harsh, especially with underage students.\n\nThe ethical angle: Is it right to report peers even if the school's policies are strict? The author feels bad about it, which might indicate they think they crossed a line. But others might see it as doing the right thing.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to report the students and whether the consequences were their fault. Since the school had a policy in place, the author's report was a consequence of that policy. But by not following the school's procedures (like telling a teacher instead of directly confronting the students and then the officer), maybe the author acted inappropriately. However, the main action was reporting, which is generally encouraged to prevent wrongdoing. \n\nBut considering the outcome, the harsh punishments (expulsion of a freshman) might be seen as too severe, but the author isn't responsible for the school's disciplinary measures. They just provided information. So in that case, the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author knew the student was going to be expelled and still reported them, maybe they are. But the author says they didn't know that at the time. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because they reported a rule violation, but some might argue A. But the key is the school's policy led to the expulsion. The author's action was a report, which is generally acceptable. The school's harsh action is on them. So the answer is B.\n"
