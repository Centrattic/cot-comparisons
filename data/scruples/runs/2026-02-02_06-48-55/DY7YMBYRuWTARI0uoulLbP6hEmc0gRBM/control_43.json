So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because they have to walk farther now. Then, they see other students vaping in the other restroom, don't confront them directly, but instead tell a school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nHmm, so the key points here: the author didn't report the initial problem when the first restroom was closed. They waited until they saw another group vaping. Then they went to the officer without confronting the students first. The result is that some kids got suspended or expelled. The author is conflicted because they feel they're doing the right thing by stopping the vaping, but also upset about the consequences on the students.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're following school rules by reporting the violation. Vaping in school is against the rules, so the students were breaking them. The officer had to enforce the rules, leading to disciplinary actions. The author might think they're doing the right thing by stopping the behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't try to address the issue directly with the students first. They chose to report immediately, which led to expelling someone. The author might be seen as a tattletale, especially since they didn't confront the students themselves. Also, considering the kids are 14-15, maybe they didn't realize the seriousness. However, the school's policy is in place for a reason, so the officer had to follow it.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the school's initial response. They closed the restroom instead of addressing the students, which the author found frustrating. The author's motivation might be more about personal inconvenience than the actual vaping. That's a point against them. They might be acting out of spite rather than concern for the rules.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intent and proportionality. If the author's main issue was the inconvenience, then their action might be seen as selfish. However, if the main issue is enforcing school rules, maybe they're justified. But since they didn't try to talk to the students first, it's more of a report-only approach, which could be seen as bypassing peer responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: the school's handling of the first issue (closed restroom instead of punishing students) might have contributed to the ongoing problem. The author's action could be seen as trying to correct a flawed system, but their method is questionable.\n\nSo, the author is in a tricky spot. They might not be in the wrong for reporting the violation, but the way they did it without trying to address it directly first could make others think they're tattling. Also, the personal inconvenience factor might make people question their true intent. The expelled kid's repeated offenses are a point in the author's favor, but the others are just freshmen getting suspended for the first time. \n\nOverall, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't confront the students first and their motivation might have been more about their own frustration than the welfare of the students. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they followed the rules. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because of the lack of direct confrontation and personal motive.\n"
