So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported others for vaping in a different restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The school closed a restroom due to repeated violations, but the problem persisted in another area. The author, frustrated, saw kids vaping and reported them. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself but are upset about breaking school rules for peer approval. They took action without directly confronting the students first, opting to inform the resource officer. The consequences were harsh for freshmen, which makes the author feel bad.\n\nLegally, students have the right to report violations. However, the moral aspect is trickier. The author didn't know the full story of the other kids. Maybe some had extenuating circumstances or were being forced. By not confronting them first, the author didn't give them a chance to stop. Also, the school's policy might be strict, leading to expulsion for a kid with prior offenses. The author's action, while following rules, might have caused disproportionate consequences for younger students who might not fully grasp the implications.\n\nOn the other hand, the school is responsible for enforcing rules to maintain safety and order. The students were violating a clear policy. The author's report could be seen as upholding those rules, which is their duty as a student. However, the intent to cause trouble by \"screwing\" those guys might indicate malice, which complicates things. \n\nConsidering the principle of \"snitching\" in school settings, there's a cultural aspect where students avoid reporting peers. But in this case, the action led to significant consequences. The author's frustration with the school's initial solution (closing a restroom instead of addressing the root issue) might justify their actions, but they still chose to take matters into their own hands rather than reporting through appropriate channels for a resolution.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author's action was within their rights, but the intent and the resulting harm to younger students might place them in the wrong morally. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
