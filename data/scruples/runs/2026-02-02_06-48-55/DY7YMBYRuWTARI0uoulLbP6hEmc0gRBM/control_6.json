So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is that a school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The person in the story, who is a student, feels wronged because they have to walk farther for the bathroom now. They then see other students vaping in the other bathroom, report it, and several kids get suspended, one expelled. The question is whether the reporter is at fault.\n\nFirst, the school's policy against vaping is likely school rule. The students in the bathroom were violating that policy. The reporter saw them and reported it. Reporting violations of school rules is generally considered the right thing to do, especially if the school has strict policies. However, there are nuances here.\n\nThe reporter mentions not being against vaping personally but against the students breaking the rules. That's a good point because it shows their motivation wasn't to target the kids but to uphold the rules. However, the consequences were severe: suspensions and an expulsion. The reporter might feel bad because the kids are young, but schools have the authority to enforce rules, even if the punishments seem harsh.\n\nBut wait, maybe the reporter is at fault for being a \"snitch\" or for not addressing the problem in a more direct way, like talking to the kids first. Alternatively, the school's policy might encourage reporting, so following that policy is justified. Also, the school's decision to close the restroom instead of punishing the students led to more issues, so the reporter's action could be seen as holding the school accountable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the reporter is just another student acting out of personal inconvenience rather than genuine concern. But the story says the reporter was upset that the school wasn't fixing the problem, so their motivation might be valid. The key here is whether the action of reporting was wrong. Legally and ethically, it's not wrong to report rule violations. The school can choose to enforce their policies, so the reporter isn't in the wrong. The expelled student had prior offenses, which the reporter wasn't aware of, but that's the school's process.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They reported a violation of school rules, which is their right. The consequences are up to the school's disciplinary actions, not the reporter's responsibility.\n"
