So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported others vaping in the bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author then noticed other students vaping in another bathroom and reported them. The school's policy is against vaping, so the students caught are violating the rules. The author didn't do anything illegal, just reported what they saw. \n\nBut the author feels bad because the kids are freshmen, 14-15 years old. They might be acting out of peer pressure and not fully understanding the consequences. The author's motivation was frustration with the school's decision to close a restroom instead of addressing the root issue. However, the action taken was to report the violation, which the school enforced strictly.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they followed the rules by reporting the violation. Schools have a duty to enforce policies, so the author's action is within their rights. On the other hand, the author might have considered whether the school's approach was too harsh, but they were just following the existing rules. The problem is that the school's policy is clear, so the author isn't necessarily at fault here. However, maybe the author could have approached the school to discuss the policy's effectiveness rather than just reporting. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for reporting. Since they followed the rules, it's more about whether their action was right, but legally and according to school policies, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No). But wait, some might argue that the author's intent was to cause trouble, but the story says they were frustrated. Still, the act itself is not wrong. So answer B.\n"
