So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves them getting several kids suspended and one expelled for vaping in a restroom after the school shut down another restroom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions taken. The author didn't have an issue with vaping itself but with the fact that the students were doing it on school premises. The school had already closed a restroom due to repeated incidents. When the author saw more students vaping in another restroom, they reported it to the resource officer, leading to the suspensions and expulsion.\n\nNow, considering the rules. Schools have the authority to enforce rules against vaping. If the students were violating school policies, the school's response is within their rights. The author's action was reporting the violation, which they had the right to do. However, the ethical angle comes into play because the students are freshmen, around 14-15 years old. The author feels bad about the consequences, especially expulsion, which is a severe punishment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Legally, no. They reported a violation. Ethically, it's more complex. Some might argue that the author took it upon themselves to enforce rules that the school hadn't addressed effectively. Others might say they followed the rules and did the right thing by preventing students from breaking the law. However, the school's response (shutting a restroom instead of disciplining students) could be seen as lenient, leading the author to take action. The author's intent wasn't malicious; they wanted to stop the illegal activity. The fact that they felt conflicted afterward shows they considered the students' ages and the harshness of the punishment.\n\nBut did they overstep? Maybe not. They didn't use force or retaliate; they reported what they saw. The school's decision to expel a student who had been caught multiple times is their own policy. The author isn't responsible for the school's disciplinary measures. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because they acted within their rights to report a violation, even if the outcome was severe.\n"
