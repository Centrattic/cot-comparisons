So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a high school student who was upset about a restroom being shut down due to students vaping. The student then reported a group of kids vaping in another restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. If the school has a strict anti-vaping policy, then the students caught vaping are violating the rules. The author's action of reporting them could be seen as upholding those policies. However, the author mentions that the students were mostly freshmen, around 14-15 years old, who might not fully understand the consequences. \n\nThe author's motivation is important here. They were upset about the restroom closure affecting their convenience. This could imply a personal grievance rather than a genuine concern for the school's rules or the students' well-being. The fact that the author didn't confront the students first but immediately went to the resource officer might suggest intent to cause trouble rather than address the issue constructively.\n\nOn the other hand, the students were indeed violating school rules by vaping. The school's response (suspensions and expulsion) is within their authority if the policy states such consequences. The author might be in the right if they believe in enforcing the rules, but their personal frustration could cloud their judgment. However, the law typically expects individuals to report violations regardless of personal feelings. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for bullying or targeting. If the author targeted the students out of spite, that's problematic. But the post doesn't explicitly state that; it's more about the author's inconvenience. The author might be acting within their rights by reporting illegal or rule-breaking activities, even if their initial feelings were about their own situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was justified under the school's code of conduct. If the school allows students to report violations, then the author isn't wrong. But if the action was taken with malicious intent, then they are. The post doesn't indicate malicious intent beyond the frustration, so it's a bit ambiguous. However, the author's own admission of feeling bad about the consequences on the freshmen suggests some level of guilt, which might indicate they feel conflicted about their actions. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions led to suspensions and an expulsion, if the school's policies support such reporting, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the personal motive of inconvenience could be seen as a negative factor. But legally and ethically, reporting rule violations is generally acceptable regardless of the reporter's personal feelings. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
