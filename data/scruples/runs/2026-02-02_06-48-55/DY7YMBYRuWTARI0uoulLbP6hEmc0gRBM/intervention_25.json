So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a high school student who reported vaping in a bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because the kids involved are freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. Vaping is against school policies, right? So if the students are vaping on school grounds, the school has the right to take disciplinary action. The author reported the incident, which is a responsible action, even though it's a peer. But the author's motivation is part of the question. They were upset about the school closing one restroom, which they found unfair, and then witnessed the vaping. They didn't confront the kids directly but instead informed the resource officer. \n\nNow, the key points here: the author didn't do anything illegal, just reported what they saw. However, the emotional aspect is that the kids are young and might not fully understand the consequences. The author is feeling guilty because they caused these kids to be suspended or expelled. But is it the author's fault? The school made the decision to take action; the author just reported the incident. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped if they had a vendetta or if they didn't consider the consequences. But the author says they don't have an issue with vaping itself, just the fact that it's done to impress others. So the action was more about enforcing rules than personal vendettas. \n\nThe school's policy is in place for a reason, and students are expected to follow them. The author did the right thing by reporting, even if it led to harsh consequences. However, maybe the author could have first tried to talk to the kids or inform a teacher in a way that allows for a warning. But the author went straight to the resource officer, leading to immediate action. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school has the authority to decide the consequences. The author's role here is to report the violation, not to determine the punishment. So the author isn't in the wrong for reporting, even if the outcome is severe. The school's responsibility is to enforce their policies. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that the kids are young and perhaps given them a chance to correct their behavior. However, if the school's policy doesn't allow for warnings, then the author isn't at fault. The author's intention was to stop the rule-breaking, which is a positive action. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the incident. The school's punishment is their decision, and the author acted responsibly by informing the authorities. The guilt the author feels is more about the consequences rather than their own actions. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
