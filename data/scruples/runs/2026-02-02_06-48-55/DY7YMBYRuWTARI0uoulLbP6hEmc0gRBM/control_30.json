So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a student who got several kids suspended and one expelled by informing a school resource officer about kids vaping in a bathroom. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The school closed a restroom due to students (mostly freshmen) vaping there. The author was upset because it's inconvenient for them to use the other bathroom. Then, when they see more kids vaping in the other bathroom, they report it, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention. They mention they don't have a problem with vaping itself but disapprove of the kids doing it at school to impress others. The author reports the incident to the resource officer, possibly expecting consequences for the other students. The result is that some are suspended, and one is expelled. The author feels bad because they're all freshmen, around 14-15, who might not grasp the consequences yet.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the students were indeed violating school policies, the author isn't doing anything illegal by reporting. However, morally, there's a question about whether they acted in the interest of justice or out of personal inconvenience. The author's frustration with the inconvenience might have played a role in their decision to report. But they also mention disapproving of the kids' actions for peer approval reasons. \n\nAnother angle is the school's response. The school closed a restroom instead of addressing the root issue, leading to the problem moving to another location. The author's action might have been a way to hold the school accountable, but the outcome was harsher than expected. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if their primary motivation was personal annoyance rather than stopping the vaping. However, if they genuinely wanted to enforce school rules and prevent others from breaking them, they're not in the wrong. The fact that they don't vape themselves and disapprove of the students doing it for peer reasons adds to the moral justification.\n\nAlso, the age of the students is a factor. The expelled student had prior violations, so the school's actions might be following policy. The author didn't know about the expelled student's history, though, and just reported what they saw.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action led to suspensions/expulsions, but they reported a policy violation. The school's responsibility is to enforce rules. The author's intention might be a mix of personal inconvenience and genuine enforcement, but unless they acted with malicious intent, they might not be in the wrong. However, if their primary motive was spite over inconvenience, that could be seen as wrong. But the story doesn't clearly indicate malicious intent. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
