So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the school closed down a restroom because students were vaping there, and the author is upset about having to walk to the other side of the school to use the bathroom. Then, the author sees a group of freshmen vaping in the other restroom, reports them, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the author's actions. The school has a policy against vaping, which is probably illegal for minors. The author didn't do anything to stop the initial problem when the first restroom was closed, but later, when they saw others vaping in the unlocked restroom, they reported it. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but are against it being done in school to please peers.\n\nSo, the author's motivation here is to uphold school rules, even if it means affecting their own convenience. But they're feeling bad because the kids are freshmen, young teenagers who might not fully understand consequences. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following the rules by reporting the violation. Schools need to enforce rules to maintain a safe environment, and if the author didn't report, more students might continue vaping, leading to a bigger problem. The resource officer is there to address such issues, so reporting is the right action.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as contributing to the suspension and expulsion of minors who are still learning. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce their policies consistently. If the school already closed one restroom due to vaping, the students should know it's against the rules. The author's action led to consequences, but the school's policies are in place for a reason.\n\nAnother point is that the author didn't confront the students or try to educate them first, just reported to the officer. But in a school setting, the appropriate action is to report to authorities rather than handle it themselves. The officer's role is to take disciplinary actions as per the school's policy.\n\nThe author's own stance is that they don't have a problem with vaping but with the students breaking the rules. So their action was about enforcing the rules, not targeting the activity itself. The school's policies are likely strict, and the resource officer is there to enforce them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the violation. The consequences are a result of the school's policies, not the author's intent to harm.\n"
