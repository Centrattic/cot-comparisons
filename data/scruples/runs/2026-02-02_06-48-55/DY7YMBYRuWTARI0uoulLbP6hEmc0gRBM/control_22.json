So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a high school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was annoyed because they now have to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, when they see a group of students vaping in the other bathroom, they report them to the school resource officer. As a result, several kids get suspended and one is expelled. The author is conflicted because they feel bad about the kids being punished, especially since they're freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the author's actions. The school had a policy of closing the restroom instead of punishing the students, which might be seen as lenient. However, the author took it upon themselves to report the current vapers. Was that their responsibility? In some ways, yes, because vaping is against school rules, and students are often encouraged to report such activities. But the author didn't intervene directly; they just told the officer afterwards. \n\nThen there's the outcome: suspensions and an expulsion. The author might feel guilty because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences. But the school's actions are their own policy. The author didn't set the punishment, just reported the incident. However, their action led to severe consequences. Was it right to report them? If the school is strict, then reporting is part of the system. But if the school wasn't enforcing the rules before, maybe the author's action was overstepping. \n\nAnother angle: the author was upset about the inconvenience, so their motivation might not be purely about upholding rules but personal annoyance. That could be seen as a personal vendetta. However, the main issue here is whether the students were violating rules. The author's action led to following the school's procedures, which might be justified. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The school's policy led to closing the restroom instead of punishing previous offenders. The author's report might be seen as enforcing the rules, but the consequence was harsh. However, the author didn't know beforehand how severe the punishment would be. They just did what they thought was right by reporting the violation. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Maybe not, because they followed the rules as they understood them. But their personal annoyance could have played a role. However, the line between doing the right thing and taking it too far is blurry. Since the school's policy allowed for disciplinary action, the author's report was technically correct, even if the outcome was harsh. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but they might have had mixed motivations. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a case for A if the personal motivation is considered. But given the information, the action itself was reporting a violation, which is the right thing to do, even if the consequences were severe. So likely B.\n"
