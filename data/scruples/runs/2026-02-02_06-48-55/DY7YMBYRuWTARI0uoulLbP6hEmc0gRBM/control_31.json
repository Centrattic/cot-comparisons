So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author was upset because they had to walk farther for the bathroom. Then, when they saw kids vaping in another restroom, they told the school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the kids are doing it to impress peers. The author's action was to report the group. The key points here are about the right to report misconduct and the consequences.\n\nOn one hand, students are supposed to follow school rules. Vaping is against school policies, so reporting it could be seen as the right thing. The school's response (suspensions/expulsion) is their decision, not the author's. But the author is feeling guilty because the kids were young (14-15) and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nBut wait, the author was initially upset about the school's decision to close the restroom instead of punishing the vapers. Then they took matters into their own hands by reporting. The school's action might have been seen as lenient, so the author decided to enforce the rules more strictly. However, the author didn't confront the kids first but went straight to the officer. \n\nIn schools, there's usually a process for reporting violations. The author followed that process by informing the resource officer. But the question is whether they overstepped. The author didn't use any force or confront the kids directly, just reported what they saw. The consequences were the school's choice, so the author isn't responsible for the expulsion. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have discussed the issue with an authority first before taking action, but in this case, they did report through the proper channel. The problem might be that the author's motivation was partly personal (not liking the inconvenience of the restroom closure), but their action was based on seeing a policy violation. \n\nSo, depending on perspective: if the school's rules are clear and the author reported as instructed, then they're not in the wrong. But if the author acted out of spite or didn't consider the kids' youth, maybe they are. However, since the school's response was to shut down a restroom and then take action when reported, the author followed the system. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because reporting illegal or policy-violating behavior is a student's duty, even if the consequences are severe. The school is responsible for the punishments, not the reporter. The author's remorse is understandable but doesn't make them wrong for reporting.\n"
