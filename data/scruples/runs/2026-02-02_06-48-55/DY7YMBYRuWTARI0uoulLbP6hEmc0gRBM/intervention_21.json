So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation is that their school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem moved to another restroom. The author then reported a group of kids vaping in the other restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. They feel bad because the kids are freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. If vaping is against school policy, the students were violating those rules regardless of the restroom. The author reported them, which led to consequences. The question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting.\n\nFrom one angle, the author is following the rules and taking responsibility by reporting illegal activity. They might feel they're doing the right thing by upholding school policies. However, there's also the consideration of peer pressure and the age of the students. Freshmen might be influenced by their peers and not fully understand the consequences. The author might be contributing to harsh outcomes that affect these young students' academic records.\n\nBut the author's intention was to address the problem they felt the school was neglecting. They might see their action as necessary to enforce rules. On the other hand, maybe there's a lack of empathy for the students' situation. However, the school's responsibility is to enforce rules to maintain a safe environment. The author's action could be seen as a civic duty, even if it results in harsh consequences for the students.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't confront the students directly but reported them to the resource officer. That's a standard procedure. The school's role is to handle such violations. The author might be in the right for reporting, but the emotional aspect of the situation complicates it. The expelled student was caught multiple times, which is a factor. The author's motivation was frustration over the school's initial response, not personal gain. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting the violation. They acted within the school's procedures. However, their lack of empathy for the students' age could be a point against them. But the main action is reporting a policy violation, which is generally considered right. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a debate about the proportionality of the punishment and the impact on the students. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing in reporting, not the school's handling, the answer might be B.\n"
