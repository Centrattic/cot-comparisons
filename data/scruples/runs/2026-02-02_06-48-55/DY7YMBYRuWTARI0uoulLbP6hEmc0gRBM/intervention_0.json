So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. So, the author's high school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because now they have to walk farther to the bathroom. Then, the author saw kids vaping in another restroom, didn't confront them, but instead told the resource officer, leading to several suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because they were all freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's main gripe was the school's handling of the problem\u2014just closing the bathroom instead of addressing the root cause. The author then took it upon themselves to report the vaping incident, which resulted in expulsions. The question is whether the author was wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author might feel justified in reporting because they thought the school wasn't doing enough. But since the students were all underaged and maybe didn't realize the consequences, the author feels bad. Legally, the school probably has rules against vaping, so the author's report was within their rights. However, the author didn't try to address the problem directly, like talking to the students or maybe suggesting a better solution to the school. Instead, they immediately escalated it, leading to harsh consequences for minors. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be projecting their own frustration onto the situation. They wanted the school to take action but were upset when the school didn't punish the students enough. Then, when they saw the behavior again, they took matters into their own hands. This could be seen as a form of vigilante justice, which isn't right because the school should handle such issues. \n\nAlso, the author admits they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it for peer approval. However, enforcing school rules is a separate matter. Even if the author disagrees with the school's initial approach, bypassing the proper channels and directly involving authorities might be wrong because it's not their role to enforce discipline. \n\nThe fact that the students were all freshmen and young adds another layer. They might not fully understand the consequences of their actions, so the author's report led to severe punishments that could impact the students' futures. The author might not have considered the long-term effects on these kids, which is a point in their favor of being in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the school has a duty to maintain a safe environment, and vaping is a violation. The author is reporting a breach of school policy, which is their right. However, the intent might be questionable. The author's frustration with the school's prior inaction could have influenced their decision to report, leading to over-punishment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they didn't address the issue through proper channels and instead took a harsher approach, leading to severe consequences for minors. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong (B) because they were upholding school rules. But given the context and the author's admission of feeling bad about the outcome, the more likely answer is that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
