So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a high school that closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset because now they have to walk to the other side of the school. When they go to the other bathroom, they see a group of kids vaping again. Instead of confronting them directly, the author tells the school resource officer, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If the school has a policy against vaping, then the kids are breaking the rules. The author reported them, so maybe they were just enforcing the rules. But the author mentions they don't have an issue with vaping itself, just that the kids are doing it to impress others. However, the problem is about the school's policy, not the author's personal opinion.\n\nThen, the author didn't confront the kids but instead went to the officer. That's a bit passive-aggressive. Maybe the right approach would be to talk to the kids first, warn them, or find another way to address the issue without immediately involving authorities. But if the school's policy is strict and the officer is supposed to handle such issues, maybe reporting is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the consequences were severe: suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young (14-15) and might not realize the consequences. The author's motivation was frustration over the restroom closure, which might have caused their overreaction. But if the kids were repeatedly breaking rules, maybe the school's actions were warranted.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If they are supposed to report rule violations, then no. But if they did it out of spite because they were upset about the restroom closure, that's a different story. The line between doing the right thing and seeking revenge can be blurry here. The author might have escalated the situation unnecessarily, leading to harsh consequences for the kids. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not addressing it more constructively.\n"
