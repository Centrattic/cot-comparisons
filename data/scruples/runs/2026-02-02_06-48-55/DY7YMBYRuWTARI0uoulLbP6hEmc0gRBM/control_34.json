So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting a bunch of kids suspended and one expelled. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The school closed a restroom where students were vaping, which made the narrator walk farther. Then the narrator saw kids vaping in another bathroom and told a resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nI need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a strict policy against vaping, then the students were breaking the rules. The author reported them, which led to consequences. But was the author wrong? Well, they had a personal motive because the school's action affected them. Maybe they felt the school wasn't addressing the problem by just closing the bathroom. \n\nIs the author's action justified? On one hand, they're following the school's rules and policies by reporting the violation. On the other hand, they might have been influenced by their own frustration with the school's decision. However, it's still their responsibility to report rule-breaking. But the author is feeling bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't know better. However, the school has rules for a reason, and students should be aware of them. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't confront the kids first; they just told the officer. Maybe they didn't give the kids a chance to stop. But if the school's policy is to report directly, then that's acceptable. Also, the fact that the school expelled one kid after multiple offenses shows they have a system in place. The author's action might have been a necessary step in that system. \n\nHowever, the author's intention to avoid the inconvenience of walking might have influenced their decision. But that's a bit self-serving. Still, they reported a violation, which is their right. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether they acted within the school's policies. If they did, then they're not in the wrong. If they acted out of spite, maybe they are. But the post doesn't indicate that; it's more about following the rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they reported the violation as per the school's protocols. Even though they were frustrated, they took the appropriate action. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
