So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them reporting a group of students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. They feel bad because it's freshmen, 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem continued. The author, frustrated by the inconvenience, went to another bathroom, saw more students vaping, and reported them. The school took action, expelling one student. The author is conflicted because they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the students are doing it to impress peers. They feel bad about the consequences on the kids.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Reporting illegal or policy-breaking activities is generally seen as responsible. However, the author's motivation was partly personal inconvenience. They might be overstepping if they didn't consider the school's role in addressing the issue. On the other hand, the students were violating rules, and the school's job is to enforce policies. The author's action led to severe consequences for minors. Some might argue that the school should handle it without student intervention, but others might say the author was doing the right thing by stopping rule-breaking.\n\nBut the author's own admission that they're not against vaping per se but the students' behavior suggests they might have personal issues with peer pressure. The fact that they didn't confront the students directly but instead went to an authority figure could be seen as tattling, which might be frowned upon in a school setting. However, legal and policy-wise, reporting is acceptable.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider intentions. If the author's main intent was to solve the problem for their own convenience rather than the students' well-being, that could tip the scale. Also, the severity of consequences (expulsion) for minors is a point of concern. Some might argue the school's response is too harsh, but the author's role in triggering that is ambiguous.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting the students, as it's their responsibility to follow school rules. However, their personal frustration and the resulting consequences on others might make them question their own actions. But according to typical AITA standards, if someone reports a violation, they're often not in the wrong unless they had malicious intent. The author's intent seems mixed, but the act itself isn't wrong.\n"
