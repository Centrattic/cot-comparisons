So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a high school student who reported a group of freshmen vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author was upset because this made their life harder, having to walk to another bathroom. Then they saw a group of kids vaping there, didn't confront them but told the resource officer. The result was multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nNow, considering the rules. Schools typically have policies against vaping, and students are expected to follow them. If the author reported the violation, they were following school rules. However, the school's response might have been harsh, especially expelling a student for repeated offenses. But the author's action was to report what they saw, which is within their rights. They didn't encourage or participate in the vaping; they just informed the authorities. Also, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the kids doing it to impress peers. So the motivation was to stop the misuse of school facilities, even if they had a personal inconvenience.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author didn't directly confront the students, which could have been a chance to address the issue without involving authorities. However, they might have felt it was their duty to report. The school's decision to expel someone for repeated violations is their policy, and the author isn't responsible for that consequence. The question is whether the author acted in the wrong by reporting. Since they were following the rules and didn't act recklessly, maybe they're not at fault. On the other hand, if they had a history of issues or targeted the students, it could be different. But from the description, they just reported what they saw. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
