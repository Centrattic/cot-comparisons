So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

The situation is that the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which the author found inconvenient. Then the author saw kids vaping in the other restroom and told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because they're all freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and the school's responsibility. Vaping in school is against the rules, and the school has a duty to enforce policies to maintain a safe environment. The author reported the violation, which is a civic duty. However, the school's decision to close a restroom without addressing the root issue might have contributed to the problem. But the author's action was to report what they saw, which is legitimate. The fact that they didn't vape themselves and were concerned about the school's handling is a factor. However, the expulsions and suspensions might be seen as harsh, but the school has the authority to enforce consequences. The author isn't directly responsible for the punishments; they just reported the incident. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
