So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported a group of freshmen vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because the kids are only 14-15 and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a strict policy against vaping and the students were violating it, then the resource officer would handle it. The author reported the incident, which is a responsible action if the school enforces the rules. However, the author's motivation was partly about the inconvenience of having to walk to the other side of the school. That might make the action seem self-serving rather than purely about safety or policy. \n\nBut wait, even if there's a personal motive, reporting illegal or prohibited activities is generally encouraged. The students were breaking the rules regardless of their age. The school's response (suspensions and expulsion) is their decision based on their policies. The author didn't decide the punishment; that's up to the administration. \n\nThe author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't understand. However, ignorance of the rules doesn't excuse the violation. The school's responsibility is to enforce rules consistently. So, the author didn't do anything wrong by reporting. They followed the correct procedure by informing an authority. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's action was harsh and led to severe consequences. But the author didn't cause the punishment; the school did. The author's role was to report, which is the right thing to do. The question is about the author's wrongdoing, not the school's response. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported a violation, which is a responsible action, even if the outcome was harsh. The author isn't responsible for the school's disciplinary decisions.\n"
