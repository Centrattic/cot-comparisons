So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting multiple students suspended and one expelled. The situation involves a high school restroom closure due to vaping, and the author reporting a group of students vaping in another restroom.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, but the problem persisted. The author, frustrated by having to walk further to use the bathroom, saw a group of freshmen vaping in another restroom. Instead of confronting them, they reported to a school resource officer, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, reporting illegal or policy-violating activities is usually not wrong. Vaping in school is against policies, so the author did the right thing by reporting. However, there's a moral aspect. The author admits they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. The action resulted in severe consequences for young students. The author might feel guilty for causing suspensions/expulsion, especially since the kids are young and still learning.\n\nBut the author's intent was to enforce the rules, not to target the kids. The school's policy was in place, and the author followed it. However, the method could be questioned. Instead of immediately reporting, maybe they could have tried to talk to the students or inform the school in a less confrontational way. But since they did report and the school took action, it's within their right. The main issue is whether the author overstepped, but since they were following school rules, they might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), but there's a gray area. Another angle: the author's frustration led to an action that caused harsh consequences. But legally and by school policy, they're justified. So the answer is B.\n"
