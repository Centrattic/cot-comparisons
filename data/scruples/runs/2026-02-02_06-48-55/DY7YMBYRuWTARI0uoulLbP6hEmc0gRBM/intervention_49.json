So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves them reporting students vaping in a bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and an expulsion. The author is conflicted because they think they're not against vaping but are against the kids doing it at school to impress others. They also mention that the school shut down a restroom, which annoyed them because they had to walk farther.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Reporting illegal or school policy-violating activities is generally a right, but there might be nuances. The key points here are: the students were vaping in school, which is against policies. The author reported them, leading to consequences. The author feels bad because they're freshmen (14-15 years old) and might not understand the consequences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't do anything illegal. They reported what they saw. However, maybe they could have handled it differently. For instance, reporting to a teacher or the resource officer directly instead of confronting the students. But in this case, the author did report to the officer after seeing the kids, which led to the bust. \n\nThe school's action of closing a restroom might have been a poor decision, but that's more about the school's policy. The author's action was to report the ongoing violation. The ethical question is whether it's right to expose peers to severe consequences. The author might have a point about the school not addressing the root problem, but their solution was to report the students. \n\nSome might argue that the author acted out of self-interest (annoyed by the restroom closure) and targeted the students. Others might say they're doing the right thing by enforcing rules. However, the outcome was extreme (expulsion), which could be harsh for teenagers. The author's intention was to stop the behavior, but the consequences might be disproportionate. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a gray area. They might have overstepped by not considering the consequences on the students, especially since they're young. The answer here is likely A, yes, they are in the wrong because their action, while following the rules, led to severe outcomes for minors without considering their maturity level.\n"
