So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. They provided the story where the author reported a group of students vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The user thinks the author is wrong because the students were just freshmen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies of the school. If the school has a strict no-vaping policy, then the students were indeed violating it. The author reported them, which could be seen as doing the right thing. However, the author might have overstepped by not giving the students a chance to stop before reporting. Also, the fact that they're freshmen might mean they're less aware of the consequences. But the author's action led to serious consequences, like expulsion, which is harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the school already closed a restroom due to previous incidents. Maybe this is a pattern, and the author is trying to enforce the rules. But is it the student's responsibility to enforce these rules? That's debatable. The author might not have considered the impact on the students' lives, like the expelled one. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the school's policy is clear and the students were violating it, then the author isn't wrong for reporting. But if the author acted without giving a warning or if the punishment is too severe, then maybe they are. The key points are the school's policies, the age of the students, and the consequences. The author's intention was to stop the vaping, but the outcome was harsh. The answer might depend on cultural or educational context. In some places, students are expected to report violations, but others might see this as taking matters into their own hands. \n\nI think the author's wrong in not considering the students' youth and the severity of the punishment. They could have approached the situation differently, maybe by confronting the students first or reporting it in a way that allows for a less severe outcome. So, the answer would be A.\n"
