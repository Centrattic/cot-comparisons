So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a student who reported others for vaping in the school bathroom after the school closed down one restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because the students involved are freshmen, around 14-15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which didn't solve the problem. The author was inconvenienced because they had to go to another restroom. When they saw more students vaping in the remaining restroom, they told the resource officer, leading to punishments. The author's defense is that they didn't want to condone the behavior, even though they don't have a problem with vaping itself. They feel guilty because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author reported the wrongdoing, which is a civic duty. Schools have rules against vaping, so enforcing those rules by reporting could be seen as right. However, the author might have overstepped by taking it upon themselves to act, especially if the school's policies were not being properly enforced. The fact that the school had already closed a restroom for the same issue might indicate a systemic problem. The author's motivation was personal inconvenience, which could be seen as self-serving. The result was harsh consequences for the students, which the author now feels bad about.\n\nBut then again, the school is responsible for enforcing rules. If the author reported the incident, the school's decision to expel someone who had prior offenses is their policy. The author might not be at fault for following the rules. However, the author's role in getting multiple students suspended and one expelled raises questions about their responsibility. The key points are: the author's intent, whether they acted within the school's policies, and the consequences of their actions.\n\nIf the school's policies allowed for such strict punishments, then the author might not be wrong for reporting. But if the school's approach was to close a restroom without addressing the root causes, the author's action might have exacerbated the problem. Also, the author's own inconvenience led them to take action, which might be seen as selfish. The moral aspect is about whether the author should have taken it upon themselves to act, even if the school's methods were flawed.\n\nIn some cases, blowing the whistle on wrongdoing is seen as right, but when it leads to severe consequences for minors, it's more complex. The author's guilt might be valid if the punishments were too harsh. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author reported the truth, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But their personal feelings about the students being young and not understanding the world might indicate that the punishment was too harsh. The school's actions might be at fault, not the author. Alternatively, the author could have tried to address the issue through proper channels first, like talking to a teacher or staff member, rather than directly reporting the students. But they did report it to the resource officer, which is a proper channel.\n\nHmm. The answer might depend on the perspective. If the school's policies are being followed, the author is in the right. If the author's intent was to spite the students due to personal inconvenience, then maybe they are in the wrong. The Reddit post says the author didn't have a problem with vaping but with the students doing it to please peers. So the author's action was to stop the behavior, not the vaping itself. The school's closure of the restroom was a reactive measure. The author's action led to consequences, but if the school's rules are clear, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, considering the age of the students and the severity of the punishment, maybe the author should have considered that. The answer is probably A or B, but I need to decide.\n"
