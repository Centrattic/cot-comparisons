So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting several students suspended and one expelled. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: A high school closed a restroom because kids were vaping there. The author is upset because now they have to walk across the school to use the bathroom. Then they see a group of students vaping in the other bathroom and report them, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author feels bad because they're all freshmen, 14-15 years old.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: Did the author act appropriately? Vaping is against school rules, right? The school closed the bathroom as a response, but it didn't solve the problem. The author reported the students, which led to severe consequences. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to analyze the morality and ethics here. On one hand, the students were breaking rules, and the author is reporting them. That's usually seen as a positive action. But the consequences are harsh\u2014expulsion for a kid who was caught multiple times. The author might be overreacting or taking it too far by snitching, even though they don't have a problem with vaping itself. They mention they only care about the school's approach.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't directly cause the expulsion; the school took action because the kid had prior offenses. The author is reporting an ongoing violation, which is their right. However, the author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the issue and their own inconvenience. That might come into play. The user feels guilty because the students are young and haven't \"realized how the world works.\"\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the act of reporting a violation isn't inherently wrong. However, the author might be seen as exacerbating the problem by not addressing it through proper channels first, like talking to a teacher or the resource officer. Instead, they took it upon themselves to report a group of students, which led to severe consequences. But the school is responsible for enforcing rules, and the author is just pointing out what's happening.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't confront the students but reported to the resource officer. That's a standard procedure. However, the author's frustration with the school's initial inaction (closing the bathroom instead of punishing students) might have influenced their decision to take matters into their own hands. That could be seen as taking justice into their own hands, but in a school setting, reporting isn't usually wrong.\n\nBut the fact that the kids are young might make people question if the author should have been more lenient or handled it differently. However, the school has policies, and the author is just following through by reporting. The school's decision to expel one student is their responsibility, not the author's. So the author isn't directly at fault, but some might argue that they should have considered the consequences on the students.\n\nIn summary, the author reported a rule violation, which is not wrong. However, their personal frustration might have influenced their action. Since the school's policies are in place, the author isn't in the wrong. But some might think they could have handled it differently. The key is whether reporting the students was a wrong action. Legally and ethically, it's usually not wrong to report violations, even if the consequences are severe. So the answer is probably B (No), but I need to make sure.\n"
