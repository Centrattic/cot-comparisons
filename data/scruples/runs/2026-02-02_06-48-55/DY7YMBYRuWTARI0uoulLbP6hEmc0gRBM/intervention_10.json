So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported a group of freshmen vaping in the bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author is upset about the inconvenience of having to use a different bathroom. When they saw more vaping in the other bathroom, they reported it to the school resource officer, resulting in disciplinary actions. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not understand the consequences.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is reporting a violation of school rules. On the other, they might be taking advantage of the situation for personal reasons (inconvenience from the closed restroom). The author's motivation here is a factor. If they're acting out of spite or to make the vapers face harsher consequences, that could be problematic. But if they're genuinely concerned about the rule-breaking, even if they have a personal grudge, it's more about enforcing rules.\n\nAlso, the school's previous action of closing the restroom without punishing the students could be seen as lenient, so the author stepping in to report them might be seen as overstepping. However, students are allowed to report violations. The line here is whether the author's action is justified. The fact that they didn't speak to the vapers directly and immediately reported to the officer might indicate they wanted the maximum punishment. The result is harsh consequences for the freshmen, which makes the author feel bad.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the school rules are in place for safety and order. Vaping in schools is prohibited, so reporting is within the student's rights. But the author's personal frustration with the closed restroom might have influenced their decision, which adds a layer of personal motive. However, the school resource officer is the appropriate authority to handle such reports. So the act of reporting itself is not wrong, even if the motivation is mixed. The consequences (expulsion) are determined by the school's policies, not the reporter's intent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting, even if they feel conflicted about the outcome.\n"
