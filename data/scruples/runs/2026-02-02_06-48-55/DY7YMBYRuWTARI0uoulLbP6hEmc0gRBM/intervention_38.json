So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported others vaping in a bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The user initially thought the author might be wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there. The author found another bathroom full of vapers and told the resource officer, resulting in punishments. The author feels bad because the kids are young and might not realize the consequences.\n\nSo, the main points here: The school's policy was to close a bathroom instead of punishing students, which the author found frustrating. The author then took action by reporting the incident. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nPossible angles: \n- The legality or school rules about vaping. If the school has a strict policy, the author might be right in reporting to enforce it. \n- The author's intent: They didn't like the school's approach of closing the bathroom instead of addressing the root problem. By reporting, they might be trying to hold students accountable. \n- However, the author's motivation could be personal (inconvenience of walking farther to the bathroom) rather than purely enforcing rules. \n- The outcome was expelling a student, which is harsh, but the student had prior violations. The author might feel guilt because they targeted freshmen, who are young. \n\nMoral vs. legal aspects: Legally, if the students were violating school policy, reporting them is within the author's rights. Morally, it's more complex. The author's action led to punitive measures, but they might be justified in enforcing rules. However, using personal inconvenience as motivation might not be noble. Also, the author didn't confront the students directly but reported them, which could be seen as ratting out, which some might view negatively in a school environment.\n\nAnother angle: The school's initial approach of closing the bathroom instead of punishment. The author's action can be seen as a form of vigilante justice, which can have unintended consequences. But if the school's policies are clear, the author is just following through.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not having a problem with vaping itself but the fact that students are doing it to impress peers. So the author's issue is with the behavior's social aspect, not the act of vaping itself. That might affect the moral judgment.\n\nIn summary, there's a conflict between personal motives and enforcing school rules. The answer hinges on whether the author's action was justified under the school's policies and the intent behind reporting the students. If the school's policy allows for such reports and the students were indeed violating rules, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the action was driven more by personal irritation than a genuine concern for the students' well-being, some might argue it's wrong.\n\nBut the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, possibly due to the consequences on the students and the author's personal motive. However, others might see it as upholding rules. The answer is likely A (yes) because the author's personal inconvenience led to significant consequences for others, even if the intent was to follow rules. The moral responsibility here is on the author for the outcome, especially considering the age of the students involved.\n"
