So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported a group of freshmen vaping in the bathroom, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids are young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has strict policies against vaping and the students were violating them, then the author reporting them might be within their rights. But there's a nuance here. The author is upset because the school closed a restroom instead of punishing the initial vapers, and this led to the author having to walk farther. Then, when they saw more vaping, they reported it. The author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but the kids are doing it to impress peers.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The school's decision to close a restroom instead of addressing the problem. 2) The author's motivation for reporting the second incident\u2014maybe to get back at the school for the inconvenience or to enforce rules they think weren't being applied before. 3) The consequences for the students, especially the expulsion of one who had prior offenses.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the act of reporting illegal or rule-breaking behavior is generally acceptable. However, the author's intent might matter here. If they were motivated by revenge for the school's prior inaction, that could make their actions less justified. Also, considering the students are young and the expulsions might be harsh, the author might feel guilty about contributing to serious penalties. But legally and according to school policy, if the students were indeed violating rules, the author isn't in the wrong for informing the authorities. However, the ethical aspect is complicated. The author might have escalated the situation unnecessarily or acted out of spite rather than genuine concern. The fact that they mention not having an issue with vaping but with the kids' motives adds another layer\u2014maybe they are judgmental about the students' reasons.\n\nSo, balancing the school's responsibility to enforce rules and the author's possible overstepping by targeting the students as a form of retaliation against the school's earlier action. If the author's main goal was to get back at the school for closing the restroom, then yes, they are in the wrong. But if they genuinely wanted to stop the vaping to comply with school policies, then they are not in the wrong. The story isn't entirely clear on the author's motivation beyond their frustration with the restroom closure and the students' actions. The author might have overreacted by reporting everyone, leading to harsh consequences for minors. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might have acted within their rights by reporting the violation, but their personal motivation and the outcome's severity could make them feel guilty. But from a strict rule-enforcement perspective, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, the ethical consideration of their intent and the impact on the students might tip the balance. I'm leaning towards A (they are in the wrong) because of the potential for selfish motivation and the harsh consequences on minors, but it's a close call.\n"
