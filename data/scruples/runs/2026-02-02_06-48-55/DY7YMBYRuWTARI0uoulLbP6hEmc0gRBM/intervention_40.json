So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported others for vaping is in the wrong. The situation involves a school that closed a restroom due to students vaping there. The person in question is unhappy about having to use a different restroom and then sees a group of freshmen vaping in another bathroom. Instead of reporting them directly, they tell the school resource officer, which leads to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The person feels guilty because the kids are young.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's rules. Vaping in school is typically against the rules, so the students are technically doing something wrong. The school's response to the first restroom was to close it, but the problem persisted. The person in the story reports the students when they see them again in another bathroom. \n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether the person's intent and the consequences make them wrong. They were inconvenienced by the restroom closure and sought to address the issue by reporting others. But the students are freshmen, who are young and may not fully understand the consequences. The person might have overreacted, especially if they didn't address the situation directly with the students first. \n\nHowever, the school has a responsibility to enforce rules, and if the person is following the policies by reporting to the resource officer, they might be acting within the system's framework. But was it their place to escalate the situation to such extremes? The fact that one kid was expelled repeatedly suggests that the school is taking strict action, which might be warranted, but the person's role in causing that outcome could be questioned. \n\nOn the other hand, the person might be doing the right thing by enforcing the rules they dislike. They could feel that the school isn't addressing the problem, so they take initiative. But the consequences for the students might be too harsh, especially if the person didn't try to talk to them first. \n\nThe key points are: the person's motivation (personal inconvenience vs. rule enforcement), the age of the students, and the proportionality of the punishment. The person might be in the wrong because they didn't give the students a chance to stop on their own, and instead chose to involve authorities immediately, leading to severe consequences. However, if the school's rules are clear, they might just be following protocol. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the person acted responsibly. Since the students are young and the person didn't attempt to resolve it themselves first, it's possible they're in the wrong. So the answer might be A.\n"
