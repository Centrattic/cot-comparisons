So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, and the author was upset because they had to walk farther. Then, when they saw more kids vaping in the other bathroom, they told the resource officer, leading to suspensions and one expulsion. The author is now feeling bad because the kids were just 14-15-year-olds who might not know better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. Vaping is probably against school policy, so the kids were breaking the rules. The author reported them, which is the right thing if they were indeed violating policies. However, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping themselves, but the issue is the students doing it to please their peers. That's a bit of a red flag. If the author is reporting the kids not for the act itself but for the reason behind it, maybe that's a problem. But the school's responsibility is to enforce policies regardless of the students' motivations.\n\nNext, the author's actions led to suspensions and an expulsion. Was that necessary? If the kids were clearly violating the rules, then the school's response is within their authority. The author might just be following the rules by reporting the incident. However, the author's initial frustration about the school closing the restroom instead of punishing the students could indicate a desire for stricter consequences. But when they saw another group, they took action, which might be seen as seeking retribution or not giving the school the benefit of handling it themselves. \n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the kids or talk to them first; they just went straight to the officer. That could be seen as not giving the kids a chance to stop, but if the author didn't want to be involved, maybe that's okay. The school's job is to enforce rules, so the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting them. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author's main issue was with the school's prior decision to close the restroom instead of punishing the students. Then, when they saw more kids doing the same, they decided to report them. If the school had already addressed the problem in one restroom by closing it, maybe the author felt the punishment wasn't enough. In that case, the author might have felt justified in taking matters into their own hands. However, as a student, their role is to follow the school's procedures, not to enforce them. \n\nAnother point is the age of the students. They're freshmen, so young and might be influenced by peers. The author might feel bad because the consequences are harsh, but if the school's policy is strict, the author isn't the one deciding the punishment. They're just reporting the behavior. \n\nIs the author at fault for the expulsions? Well, the school decided the consequences. The author's action was to inform the authorities. Unless there's evidence that the author encouraged others to do the same or that the school overreacted, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't actually catch the kids in the act. They saw a group and told the officer. If the officer then went in and busted them, maybe the author didn't directly get them expelled. However, the author's report likely led to the investigation. So maybe the author's intent was to get the kids punished because they were annoyed by the school's previous leniency. \n\nIn that case, the author is acting as an enforcer of the rules, which might be beyond their role. Students aren't supposed to take disciplinary actions; that's the school's responsibility. The author's frustration led them to report the kids, but that could be seen as unnecessary since the school has the authority to handle it. Also, the author's initial problem was with the school's handling of the first incident. Now, by reporting the second, they might be seen as undermining the school's methods. \n\nBut if the school has a strict policy and the students are repeatedly violating it, the author's report is just following the rules. The school's decision to expel a student is their responsibility, not the author's. The author might feel conflicted because they didn't like the harsh consequences, but they aren't the ones making that decision. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the act of reporting was justified. If the students were indeed violating school rules, then the author isn't at fault. However, if the author's action was motivated by personal annoyance rather than a genuine concern for policy enforcement, maybe there's some fault. But since the school has the authority to punish as they see fit, the author's role was to report. The expulsions are the school's choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the incident.\n"
