So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school student who reported other students vaping in a bathroom, leading to several suspensions and one expulsion. The author is conflicted because they feel they're in the wrong since the students were freshmen around 14-15 years old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies of the school. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there repeatedly. Then, when the author saw more students vaping in the other bathroom, they reported it. The school took action, expelling one student. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the students were violating school rules by vaping. The author's action was reporting the violation, which is generally considered acceptable. However, the author might have considered the age of the students and whether the punishment is too harsh. But schools have the authority to enforce their policies, and the severity of the punishment (expulsion) is up to the school's discretion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were just following the law and school rules, not seeking to get others in trouble. The problem is that the author didn't intervene directly but instead reported the incident, leading to consequences. The question is whether the author is responsible for the outcome.\n\nIn some cases, people might feel that they shouldn't snitch, but legally, reporting illegal or prohibited activities is their right. However, the author might be in the wrong if they acted out of spite or without considering the circumstances. But the post suggests they were frustrated with the school's initial inaction and wanted to address the issue properly.\n\nThe key points are the school's responsibility to enforce rules and the author's right to report violations. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting the incident, even if the consequences were severe. The school's response is their policy, not the author's doing. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A if they believe the author should have handled it differently, like talking to the school first instead of immediately reporting.\n"
