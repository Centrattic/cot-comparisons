So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school student who reported other students vaping in a restroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which the author found inconvenient. The author then saw others vaping in another restroom and reported them. The consequences were suspensions and an expulsion of a repeat offender. The author feels bad because the kids are freshmen and young.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the context. The school has rules against vaping, and students are violating them. The author reported the violation to a resource officer. Reporting illegal or prohibited activities is generally considered responsible. However, the author might have overstepped by not directly confronting the students first or by being overly zealous. \n\nBut in schools, students are often expected to report misconduct. The school's policy likely encourages students to inform authorities about rule violations. The author's action led to disciplinary actions, but since the students were breaking school rules, the author isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author acted out of self-interest (because they were inconvenienced by the closed restroom) and targeted other students. However, the main issue is that the students were vaping in a restricted area. The author's motivation might be a factor, but the act of reporting a violation is generally seen as right. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself but with the students doing it to impress peers. Still, the action of reporting illegal activity is separate from personal opinion. \n\nThe fact that a student was expelled for repeated offenses is a school's responsibility to enforce rules. The author's role in reporting is part of maintaining school policies. So, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's an argument that the author didn't handle it the right way. Should they have gone through the proper channels first? The author did report to the resource officer, which is the correct procedure. \n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they reported a violation of school rules, which is their responsibility.\n"
