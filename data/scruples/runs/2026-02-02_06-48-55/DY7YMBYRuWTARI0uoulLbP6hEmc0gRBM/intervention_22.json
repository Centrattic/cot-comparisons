So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vaping incident is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school where a restroom was shut down because students were vaping there. The author then sees other students vaping in another restroom and reports them, leading to suspensions and one expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. If the school has strict rules against vaping, then students are expected to follow them. The author didn't do anything illegal by reporting the incident. However, the question is about moral responsibility. The author mentions that the expelled student had prior violations, which might be a separate issue. \n\nThe author's motivation was frustration over the closed restroom and having to walk farther. They might have felt the school wasn't addressing the problem effectively. Reporting the incident could be seen as a way to enforce the rules, which is a positive action. But since they mention not having a problem with vaping itself, it's more about the violation of school policy rather than the act itself. \n\nStill, the consequences were harsh\u2014suspensions and expulsion. The author might be concerned about the impact on the freshmen. However, the school has the authority to enforce its rules, and the author's action was to report a violation. Unless they used excessive force or lied, they aren't directly responsible for the school's disciplinary decisions. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They followed the rules by reporting the violation. The school's response is up to them. So the answer should be B.\n"
