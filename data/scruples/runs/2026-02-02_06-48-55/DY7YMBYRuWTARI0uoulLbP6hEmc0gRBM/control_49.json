So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vaping students is in the wrong. The scenario is that the school closed a restroom due to vaping, which upset the author because they had to walk farther. Then, when the author saw more vaping in the other restroom, they reported it, leading to suspensions and an expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Vaping in school is against the rules, so students breaking that rule are at fault. The author is a student who decided to report the violation. Is reporting a rule violation inherently wrong? Probably not. But there's more to consider here.\n\nThe author mentions they don't have a problem with vaping itself, but the students are doing it to impress others. However, the author's action led to severe consequences, especially for a freshman being expelled. The user feels bad because they are young and might not understand the consequences. \n\nNow, the key points: Was the author acting as a responsible student by reporting illegal activity? Schools encourage students to report misconduct. However, the author might have overstepped by not trying to address the problem in a more constructive way first. For example, informing a teacher or the resource officer directly instead of confronting the group themselves. \n\nBut the author did approach the resource officer after seeing the incident. The officer was already present, so maybe the author's action was appropriate. However, the expulsion of a student might be seen as too harsh, especially if the student was a repeat offender. The author might not be responsible for that decision, but they do feel guilty about the outcome. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on intent and responsibility. The author's intent was to stop rule-breaking, which is generally good. However, the method might have been harsh. But since the school decided the punishment, the author isn't necessarily at fault. Alternatively, the author's action caused unnecessary harm to other students, even if they were in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: The school's initial reaction was to shut down a restroom instead of addressing the root issue, which led to the author's frustration. The author's response was to escalate the situation, leading to more suspensions. Was there a better way? Maybe, but the author isn't the one who made the school's initial decision. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of reporting is generally seen as responsible. The consequences are up to the school's disciplinary policies. So the author isn't in the wrong for doing the right thing, even if the outcomes are severe. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance where the author's motivation and the school's handling play roles. However, the main action (reporting the violation) is justified.\n"
