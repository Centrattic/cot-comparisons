So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a high school student who was upset because their school closed a restroom they used because students were vaping there. The school didn't punish the students but just shut the bathroom down. The author was inconvenienced because now they have to walk to the other side of the school. Then, when the author went to the other bathroom, they saw a group of freshmen vaping there. Instead of confronting them directly, the author told a school resource officer about it, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the kids were young and maybe didn't realize the consequences.\n\nFirst, I should consider the rules. Schools typically have policies against vaping. If students are violating those rules, the school is supposed to enforce consequences. However, the school's initial approach was to close the bathroom instead of punishing the students, which the author found inadequate.\n\nThe author then took it upon themselves to report the vaping incident. The key question is whether the author had the right to do that. Legally, in most places, students can report violations they witness. So reporting isn't inherently wrong. But there might be ethical considerations. For example, did the author confront the students first? In their story, they didn't confront them but immediately went to the officer. Maybe they could have given the students a chance to stop, but the author thought it was better to report to authorities.\n\nAnother angle is intent. The author's motivation was frustration with the school's handling of the problem. They wanted to take action to address what they saw as inaction. However, their action led to severe consequences for the students. The expelled student had multiple prior offenses, which might mean the school took that into account. But the others were suspended, which could be seen as harsh for first-time offenders, especially if they're young.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not having a problem with vaping itself but disapproving of doing it at school to impress peers. That might imply the author isn't against vaping in general, just the rule-breaking aspect. But they still reported it, which is within their right as a student.\n\nHowever, is there a responsibility to handle it differently? Maybe by talking to a teacher first or using proper channels instead of directly reporting to the resource officer. But the author did go through the correct channel (the officer), so that's valid.\n\nThe author feels bad about the outcome because of the ages of the students. But the school's job is to enforce rules regardless of the students' maturity level. The author's action led to the school taking disciplinary action, which is their role.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author did the right thing by reporting the violation. The school's response (suspensions/expulsion) is their decision, not the reporter's. The author isn't responsible for the school's disciplinary policies. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that they should have handled it differently, like talking to the students first. But the scenario doesn't indicate that the author knew the students or had a personal vendetta. It's more about taking action because they were frustrated with the school's initial inaction.\n\nAnother point: the author didn't confront the students, which could have been a step before reporting. But in some cases, confrontation could lead to conflict or escalation. Reporting directly to authorities might be safer and more appropriate, especially if the author isn't in a position to enforce rules themselves.\n\nSo overall, the author's action was within their rights. The school's response is separate from the act of reporting. The author's frustration might be valid, but their action was justified in terms of following school rules. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
