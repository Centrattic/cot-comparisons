So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the school closed a restroom because students were vaping there, which the author found frustrating because they had to walk farther. Later, the author saw kids vaping in another restroom and reported them, leading to multiple suspensions and one expulsion. The author feels bad because the students were freshmen (14-15 years old).\n\nThe author's actions resulted in severe consequences for the students. Even though they didn't vape themselves, they chose to report others. The school's policy is clear about vaping, so reporting might be seen as the right thing. But the author's motivation was annoyance at having to walk more, which could cloud their judgment.\n\nChildren that age might not fully understand the repercussions. The author didn't confront the kids but directly reported them to the resource officer. The question is whether the author overstepped. Schools have rules, and enforcing them is the school's role. While the author might not be wrong if they were following rules, the intent to get others in trouble because of personal inconvenience could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author might not have considered if the school's punishment is appropriate. The expelled student had multiple violations, so it's possible they deserved it, but the others were just suspended. The author could feel guilty for contributing to their peers' punishments, especially if they were acting out of spite.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a mix of factors. On one hand, they reported a violation. On the other, their motivation might be questionable. But the school's responsibility is to enforce rules, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, intentionally causing harm to peers for personal annoyance might make them responsible. \n\nI think the key here is whether the action was justified. If the school's policy is to punish vaping, then the author did the right thing. But if the action was motivated by personal spite rather than upholding rules, it's wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong because of the consequences, but the school's actions are separate. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because the author's intent and the impact on minors could be seen as malicious. Or maybe B (not in the wrong) because they followed the rules. I'm leaning towards A because the personal motive might be problematic.\n"
