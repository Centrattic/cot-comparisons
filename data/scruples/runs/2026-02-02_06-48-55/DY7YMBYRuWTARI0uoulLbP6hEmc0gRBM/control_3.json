So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reporting other students vaping in the bathroom, leading to suspensions and an expulsion. The author is feeling bad because the kids were freshmen and young.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The school closed a restroom due to vaping by students, but the problem continued. The author, frustrated with having to walk across the school, then sees more students vaping in the other bathroom. Instead of confronting them, the author reports to the school resource officer, resulting in consequences.\n\nNow, the key points. The author didn't do anything illegal, just reported what they saw. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author might feel bad about the consequences, but they might believe they were doing the right thing by following rules. On the other hand, some might argue that the author's actions were harsh, especially since the students are young and maybe not fully aware of the rules. However, the school's policy is against vaping, so the author is just enforcing it, even if it leads to severe punishments. The author's intention was to stop the behavior, but they caused disciplinary actions. The school's response is their own policy, so the author isn't directly responsible for the expulsion, just for reporting. So, is the author in the wrong? If the school's rules are clear and the author followed them, then they might not be. But if the action was a prank or malicious, maybe. But in this case, the author seems genuinely concerned about the rule violations. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But others might argue that it's wrong to tattle, causing harm to peers. It's a bit of a gray area. However, legally and according to school policies, the author isn't violating anything. So the answer is B.\n"
