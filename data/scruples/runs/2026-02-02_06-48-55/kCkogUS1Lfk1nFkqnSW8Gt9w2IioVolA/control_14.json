Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario is that they work at a bar/restaurant near a train station and often help homeless people by giving water, restroom access, etc. But there's a specific couple who come every morning, misuse the facilities, and take two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them because of the cups' cost and their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the business is providing services, and if someone is abusing the hospitality, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The couple's actions\u2014picking through ashtrays, sink-showering, leaving a mess\u2014could be seen as misuse, and charging for cups might deter that. But on the other hand, charging homeless individuals for basic necessities like water might be seen as exploiting their vulnerability. The cups are compostable and more expensive, but the author isn't the one buying them, so maybe the cost is a business consideration.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that other homeless people aren't as problematic, so this couple's behavior stands out. The author wants to discourage their disrespect, but is charging them the right approach? Maybe there are other ways to address the mess and misuse without charging for the cups. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong if the couple is taking advantage. The key points are intent and proportionality. If the author is trying to maintain a respectful environment without discrimination, it's a gray area. But charging homeless people for something as basic as water could be seen as inhumane, especially if they can't afford it. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they might be treating the couple unfairly despite their behavior. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if setting boundaries is justified. Need to weigh the ethical aspects here.\n"
