Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning.

Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is working at a bar/restaurant next to a train station, which gets a lot of homeless people. They usually don't mind helping out with water, restroom use, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, does some questionable things like picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower and leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. The author feels the couple is taking advantage and overstepping, while others at work don't mind.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? Let's break it down. On one hand, the business isn't obligated to provide services for free. The couple's behavior is disruptive and disrespectful, so setting boundaries makes sense. Charging for the cups could be a way to discourage the couple without being overtly hostile. The author is trying to balance helping others in need with preventing abuse of their hospitality.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that charging for water, even if it's compostable, is cruel, especially towards homeless individuals who may not have much money. The couple is part of a vulnerable group, and the author is singling them out. There's a risk of appearing judgmental or contributing to stigma against the homeless. Also, the author's coworkers are fine with giving the cups for free, so there's inconsistency in how the policy is applied.\n\nBut the key point here is that the couple's actions are causing problems\u2014messing up the bathrooms, picking through ashtrays, which could be unsanitary and a health hazard. The author is trying to protect the establishment's resources and maintain a respectful environment. Charging for the cups is a small fee that might not prevent the couple from getting water (they could pay if they can afford it) but would set a boundary against the disruptive behavior. It's a way to enforce respect without being unkind to others who aren't causing issues.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing specific problematic behavior, not punishing the entire homeless community. It's about maintaining the business's standards and ensuring that help is given to those who are respectful, not abused. The author is also considering the cost of the cups, which makes it a business decision as well. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
