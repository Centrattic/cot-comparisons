Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario is that there's a couple who comes in daily, uses the ashtrays, leaves a mess, and takes hot water cups. The author wants to start charging them since the cups are expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business owner is already providing services like water, restroom use, and conversation without issues. But the couple's behavior is problematic. They're picking through ashtrays, messing up the bathrooms, and taking two cups daily. The author feels this is overstepping and wants to charge them. \n\nOn one hand, charging for something that's typically free could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable group. However, the author is trying to set boundaries against misuse. The key here is whether the couple's actions justify a different policy for them. The cups are compostable and costly, so maybe it's about managing resources responsibly. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that other homeless individuals come in a few times a week without this issue. It's about the couple's specific behavior. The author isn't cutting them off completely but wants to discourage the mess and overuse. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're addressing misuse. However, there's a nuance here. Charging someone who can't afford it might not be effective. Maybe alternative solutions, like limiting the number of cups or politely explaining the impact, would be better. But the author's intention is to discourage, not exclude. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to manage resources and prevent abuse, though there's room for more compassionate solutions.\n"
