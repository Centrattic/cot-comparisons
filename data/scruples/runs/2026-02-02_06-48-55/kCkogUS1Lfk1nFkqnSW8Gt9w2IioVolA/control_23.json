      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The situation is that they work at a bar/restaurant near a train station with a lot of homeless people. They don't mind helping out generally, but there's a couple that comes every morning, picks through ashtrays, uses the bathroom messily, and takes two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is overstepping and taking advantage. Other homeless people come in occasionally and aren't an issue, but this couple's behavior is disrespectful. The author works mornings five days a week, and a coworker gives the cups freely the other two days. The author is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the couple's actions (picking through ashtrays, bathroom misuse, taking multiple cups daily), the author's intention to charge for cups, and whether this is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the couple's behavior might be seen as problematic. Picking through ashtrays for cigarettes is unsanitary and possibly stealing, especially if the establishment is not allowing that. Using the bathroom in a way that leaves a mess is disrespectful to others and the business. Taking two cups of hot water every day could be seen as excessive, especially if it's costing the business money. The author isn't against helping homeless people but feels this couple is taking advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, charging for water, even for cups, might be seen as a way to set boundaries. However, water is a basic necessity, and charging for it when someone is homeless could be viewed as cruel, especially if they're already in vulnerable situations. The fact that other homeless individuals come in and aren't treated the same might also be a point\u2014discriminating between homeless people based on their behavior could be problematic.\n\nThe author's coworker gives the cups freely, so there's inconsistency. The author is considering changing the policy for just this couple, which might not be fair. Also, the compostable cups are more expensive, but is that a valid reason to charge someone who can't afford it? Maybe not. The question is whether the author's actions are justified given the couple's behavior.\n\nIn terms of ethics, businesses have the right to set their policies. If the couple is violating rules (like using ashtrays, making a mess), the business could address that behavior without charging for water. Charging for something as basic as water could be seen as punitive and potentially inhumane, especially if the couple is homeless. However, if the business is losing money or resources due to this specific couple's actions, they might have a right to impose charges.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is targeting this couple specifically, not applying the policy to all homeless people. That could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the business's policy isn't clear\u2014other staff don't charge, so the author is introducing a new rule selectively. That might not be fair.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention to charge for cups based on the couple's behavior might not be the right approach. Instead, addressing the misbehavior through other means (like speaking to the couple, setting clear rules) might be more appropriate. Charging for water could be seen as the wrong action because it's targeting the couple's need rather than their behavior, potentially making the author the asshole.\n"
