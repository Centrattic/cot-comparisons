Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they work at a bar/restaurant next to a train station and get a lot of homeless people. The author generally doesn't mind giving them water, restroom access, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, they do some not-so-nice things like picking through ashtrays, using the sink to shower and leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water for their oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they feel the couple is overstepping and taking advantage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is okay with helping homeless people, but they find this particular couple's behavior disrespectful. They want to charge for the cups because the couple is causing a mess and using resources in a way they find inappropriate. The cups are compostable and more expensive, but the author isn't the one buying them. The other coworker doesn't charge them, and the author is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Charging people for something they can't afford might seem harsh, but the author isn't denying them access entirely. They just want to discourage the couple's behavior. However, the couple is already using the place in a way that's causing problems. The author's main issue is with the couple's disrespectful actions, not the homeless people in general. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to maintain a respectful environment and prevent misuse of resources. On the other hand, charging for basic necessities like water, even if it's in cups, could be seen as exploiting their situation. But since the couple is already taking items like cigarettes and causing messes, the author's stance might be about setting boundaries rather than being mean. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable way to address the specific problematic behavior. If the couple is misusing the services, then asking them to pay could be a way to deter that. However, if the water is necessary for something like oatmeal, charging might not be fair. But the author isn't refusing to provide it; they just want to implement a policy to discourage the couple's specific actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention is to address the couple's disrespectful behavior, not to be inconsiderate towards homeless people in general. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B (No).\n"
