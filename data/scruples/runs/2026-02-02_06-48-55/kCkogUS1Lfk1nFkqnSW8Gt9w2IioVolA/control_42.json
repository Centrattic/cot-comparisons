      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the person works at a bar/restaurant next to a train station. They get a lot of homeless people, but one couple comes every morning. The couple does some things like picking through ashtrays, using the bathroom in a messy way, and asking for two cups of hot water for their oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they feel the couple is overstepping and taking advantage. The cups are compostable and more expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business is providing some services (water, restroom access) to homeless individuals, which is a form of charity or community support. But the couple in question is allegedly misusing these services. The key points here are the actions of the couple versus the author's response.\n\nThe author is not directly purchasing the cups, but they want to implement a charge. Is it fair to charge someone who is homeless for basic necessities like water? Water is generally considered a basic human need, and charging for it could be seen as unkind, especially in a society where access to clean water isn't guaranteed for everyone. However, the couple's behavior might be a problem. If they're using the services in a way that's disruptive or disrespectful, then there's a case for setting boundaries.\n\nBut here's the catch: the business is already choosing to provide these services to others. So maybe the issue is whether the couple's specific actions justify a different treatment. The author mentions that other homeless individuals come in a few times a week, and they don't mind helping them. The problem is with this particular couple's behavior. So maybe the author is trying to enforce a policy that targets this couple, which could be seen as discriminatory if not applied consistently. However, if the couple's actions are indeed more problematic, it's reasonable to address their specific behavior rather than everyone.\n\nAnother angle is the cost. The cups are compostable and more expensive. If the couple is using two cups every morning, the cost might add up over time. The business might have to consider the financial impact. But again, is it ethical to charge someone who's homeless for something as basic as hot water? It depends on the perspective. On one hand, it's a business, and they have expenses. On the other hand, charging for water could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation.\n\nAlso, the author is considering implementing a policy to discourage this behavior. But instead of charging, maybe there are other ways to address the misuse, like limiting the number of cups given, asking them to clean up after using the restroom, or politely explaining the rules. Charging might be seen as a harsh measure, especially when the alternatives could be less adversarial.\n\nThe coworker who works the other two days doesn't charge them, so there's inconsistency. The author is considering changing that, which shows they want to set a standard. But is that standard fair? The couple's actions need to be clearly problematic to justify such a policy. If they're picking through ashtrays, which is unsanitary and possibly a violation of the establishment's policies, then there's a reason to address that behavior, but charging for cups might not be the appropriate response. Maybe the business should enforce rules against ashtray picking and proper restroom use instead.\n\nIn summary, the author's intention is to discourage disrespectful behavior by the couple. However, the method of charging for cups could be seen as punitive and possibly unethical, especially if it's targeting a specific group without a clear, consistent policy. The author might not be in the wrong in wanting to set boundaries, but the approach needs to consider ethical implications and alternative solutions. It's a complex situation where both the couple's actions and the author's response have valid points, but the method of charging for water might cross a line.\n"
