Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario is that they work at a bar/restaurant near a train station and usually don't mind helping homeless individuals. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, does some questionable things like picking through ashtrays, using the bathroom inappropriately, and taking two cups of hot water. The author wants to start charging them for the cups.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is part of a business that offers some level of hospitality\u2014water, restroom access, conversation. But the couple's behavior is causing the author to feel they're being taken advantage of. The couple uses compostable cups which are more expensive, and the author is concerned about their actions (like sink-showering and making a mess) as disrespectful. The other coworker doesn't charge them, but the author is considering it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main question is about charging for water. Water is a basic necessity, and many businesses allow free water refills as a service. However, the couple's actions beyond just taking water might influence this. If the business is already providing water for free, charging them could be seen as a policy change. But if the couple is misusing the service (like using the restroom in a way that's not intended, creating messes), the author might have a point in wanting to set boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't directly purchasing the cups, so maybe the cost isn't their main issue. The real issue is the couple's behavior. Charging for water could be a way to discourage that behavior. But on the other hand, people facing homelessness might have limited options, and charging for water could be seen as withholding a basic need. However, the couple's actions (picking through ashtrays, sink-showering) are not typical of someone just getting water. They might be exploiting the hospitality, which the author finds disrespectful.\n\nThe fact that other homeless individuals come in and don't cause such issues might mean the author is targeting this specific couple. The author's coworker is giving them cups without charging, but the author is considering a different approach. It's about setting limits on who they allow to use their services. The author's desire to reduce the couple's overstay and misuse could be justified as a business practice to maintain order and fair usage.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the business has a policy of free water but the couple is misusing other services, maybe the author is justified in adjusting the policy for them. However, if the business allows free water to all, including homeless people, then the author might be seen as being inconsistent or discriminatory by charging only this couple. But the couple's specific disrespectful behavior could be a reason for the policy change. The answer might depend on whether the couple's actions warrant different treatment. If their behavior is indeed a problem, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to address it by charging for cups. But if the author is singling them out without just cause, then maybe they are in the wrong. The key is the couple's misuse versus the general policy.\n"
