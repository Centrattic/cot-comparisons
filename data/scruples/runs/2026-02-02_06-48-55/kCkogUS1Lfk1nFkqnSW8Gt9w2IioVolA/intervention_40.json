Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless traffic. They mention that they generally don't mind helping out, like giving water, letting them use the restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple who come in almost every morning and behave in ways that the person finds disrespectful: picking through ashtrays, sink-showering, leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water daily.\n\nThe person wants to start charging them for the cups because the cups are compostable and more expensive. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to do that. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but is asking for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. On one hand, the couple's behavior is clearly problematic. They're taking advantage of the establishment's resources in a way that's disruptive and disrespectful. The author is trying to set boundaries here. Charging for cups could be a way to discourage the couple from overusing the service without completely cutting them off. \n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless individuals for basic needs like water can be seen as cruel, especially if they have no means to pay. However, the author isn't denying them the water entirely but is trying to implement a system that might reduce the couple's disruptive behavior. The key here is whether the couple is being treated differently from others. The author mentions that other homeless people come in a few times a week and aren't given the same treatment. The couple in question is doing more than just asking for a cup of water; they're engaging in behaviors that create a mess and potential health issues.\n\nThe author also notes that the cups are compostable and more expensive, so there's a cost consideration. However, the core issue is about respect and the establishment's right to manage how their resources are used. The author isn't denying water to everyone but is addressing a specific situation where individuals are misusing the service. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a balance between compassion and responsibility. The author isn't being cruel by charging for cups if it's to prevent waste and disrespect. They're not cutting off access but trying to enforce some rules. The couple's behavior justifies the need for boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They're trying to maintain a respectful environment for all customers, including other homeless individuals who don't engage in such behavior.\n"
