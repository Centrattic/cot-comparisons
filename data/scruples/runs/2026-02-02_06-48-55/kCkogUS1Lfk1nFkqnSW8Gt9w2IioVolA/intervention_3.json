Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The situation involves a couple who come in daily, take advantage of the restaurant's services, and leave a mess. The author wants to start charging them for the cups.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the couple's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014they're picking through ashtrays, misusing the bathroom, and taking two cups every morning. The author is part of a small business, and the compostable cups are expensive. Charging them might be a way to set boundaries and prevent the couple from overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless individuals for water is a delicate issue. Water is a basic necessity, and charging for it could be seen as exploiting someone in need. The author isn't directly purchasing the cups, but they do feel the couple is taking advantage. There's also a difference between occasional help and daily reliance. The other coworkers aren't charging, so maybe there's inconsistency in the policy.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and boundaries. The couple's actions are disrespectful, so the author's desire to enforce rules makes sense. However, the method of charging for water could be seen as punitive. Maybe there's a better approach, like politely asking them to stop and explaining the policy, or offering water without cups. But if the author is trying to maintain a respectful environment and discourage misuse, perhaps they aren't in the wrong. \n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. While the couple is causing issues, denying access to water for homeless people can be controversial. However, the author isn't denying water entirely but charging for cups, which is a different matter. The cups are a cost, and the author is trying to offset that cost from those who misuse the service. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent is to address misuse and set boundaries, which is understandable. Charging for cups might be a reasonable way to do that without completely cutting off access to water. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's also a consideration that charging homeless people for a basic need could be seen as harsh. However, given the specific behavior of the couple, the author's actions could be justified as enforcing rules rather than being mean.\n"
