Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario involves a couple who come in daily, misuse resources like ashtrays and the bathroom, and take two cups of hot water each morning. The author feels their behavior is disrespectful and wants to start charging them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Charging homeless individuals for basic necessities like water could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation. Even if the cups are expensive, the water itself is a basic human need. Plus, the couple's actions as described\u2014picking through ashtrays, leaving a mess\u2014are indeed disrespectful, but does that justify charging them?\n\nThen there's the business aspect. The author works at a bar/restaurant that's already providing services (like bathroom use) to the homeless. Charging for water might be a way to set boundaries, but it's also discriminatory. The other homeless people aren't being charged, so it's inconsistent unless there's a policy against all homeless people, which could be problematic.\n\nThe coworker doesn't charge them, so the author is considering a different approach. Maybe the author feels personally wronged by this couple's behavior, but is it fair to penalize them financially? There might be other ways to address the mess and misuse, like politely asking them to leave or reporting to management for a policy change. Charging for cups could be seen as a harsh measure without considering their circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to set boundaries, but the method of charging might not be the best approach. It's possible the author is in the wrong because it's a form of punishing them for their behavior by charging for an essential item. However, if the business allows it, maybe it's not wrong. But given the context, it's more likely the author is being unfair. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
