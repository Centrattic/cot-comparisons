Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station that gets a lot of homeless visitors. They mention that they generally don't mind helping out\u2014giving water, letting them use the restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, messes up the bathrooms, takes cigarettes from ashtrays, and takes two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive.\n\nThe author feels the couple is overstepping and being disrespectful. They note that other homeless individuals come in less frequently and don't have the same issues. The coworker on the other days gives the cups without charging, but the author is considering changing the policy for this couple specifically.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge them. Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the author is trying to maintain a level of respect and discourage misuse of resources. The couple's behavior (messing up bathrooms, picking through ashtrays) could be seen as taking advantage. Charging for the cups might be a way to set boundaries and prevent further issues.\n\nOn the other hand, charging for water, especially for a homeless couple, could be seen as inconsiderate. It might be a small expense for the business but a significant burden for them. However, the cups are a cost to the business, so the author might feel justified in recouping some costs from those who use a lot. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unfair or discriminatory. If they are singling out this couple based on their behavior, that could be justifiable. If they are applying a policy consistently, then it's fair. The author mentions that other homeless people don't have the same issues, so targeting this specific couple might be reasonable. The compostable cups are more expensive, so charging for them when others don't use as many could be seen as necessary.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to handle this? Maybe there's a better way, like talking to the couple or setting clearer boundaries without charging. However, the author feels that the couple's actions are disrespectful. In that case, wanting to charge them could be a way to enforce respect for the establishment's resources.\n\nOverall, the author's intention is to discourage misuse, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, charging for water might be seen as harsh. But given the context of the couple's behavior, the author might have a valid reason. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), as they're addressing specific misbehavior.\n"
