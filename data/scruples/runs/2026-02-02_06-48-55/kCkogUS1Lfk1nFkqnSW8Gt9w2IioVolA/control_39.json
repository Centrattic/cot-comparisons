Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station and has a lot of homeless people coming in. They're not against giving water or using the restroom, but there's this couple that comes every morning. The couple is picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower, leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water each day. The author wants to start charging them for the cups since they're compostable and more expensive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the author is already giving out cups of water to others for free. But this couple is being more demanding. They're not just taking water once, but multiple times a day, and their behavior includes things like picking through ashtrays and using the sink as a shower. That seems like they're not respecting the establishment's resources and hygiene. \n\nThe author mentions that other homeless individuals come in a few times a week and they don't mind helping, but this couple's daily presence and their specific behaviors are causing issues. The cups are compostable and more expensive, so there's a financial aspect here. The author isn't the one buying the cups, so maybe they feel the couple is taking advantage of the business's expenses. \n\nThe coworker gives them cups without charging, but the author is considering changing that. The key here is whether it's reasonable to charge this couple while others aren't charged. Since the couple is being more disruptive, maybe it's a way to discourage their behavior. The author isn't trying to harm them but wants to set boundaries. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to manage the situation respectfully without being outright hostile. They're acknowledging the couple's homelessness but also addressing the disrespectful behavior. Charging for the cups could be a way to encourage the couple to stop overusing the resources. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
