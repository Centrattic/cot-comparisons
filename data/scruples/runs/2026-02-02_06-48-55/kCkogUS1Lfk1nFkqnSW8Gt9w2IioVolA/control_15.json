Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless people. They're okay with giving out water, letting them use the restroom, etc., but there's a specific couple that comes every morning, misuses the ashtrays, messes up the bathroom, and takes two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business provides services to the public, including homeless individuals. The couple's behavior is described as picking through ashtrays (which is unsanitary and possibly stealing), using the shower in the sink (which is a misuse of facilities), and taking a lot of cups. The author feels they're taking advantage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge them. The key points here are about fairness, resource use, and the business's responsibility. The author is a worker, not the owner. They mention that others in the business might not charge, but they want to set a boundary. \n\nOn one hand, the business might have a policy of providing certain services for free, and the author might be overstepping if they start charging without management's approval. Also, the couple's actions are disruptive, so the author's concern is about maintaining a respectful environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not the owner, so making unilateral decisions about pricing could be problematic. However, if the couple is indeed misusing resources, the business might need to address that. The author's intention is to discourage bad behavior, which is understandable. But charging them could be seen as punitive without a clear policy in place. \n\nIs it fair to charge someone for a basic necessity like water? Water is a basic human need, and charging for it might be seen as inhumane, especially if they're homeless. However, the cups are a cost, and if the couple is using an excessive amount, the business might have a right to limit that. But the author should probably discuss this with management first rather than acting alone. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the couple is disrespectful, so there's a case for wanting to set boundaries. However, the method of charging for water might not be the best approach. Maybe other solutions, like limiting the number of cups or addressing the misuse of facilities directly, could be more appropriate. \n\nIn terms of the author's position as an employee, they might not have the authority to set pricing, which could be a separate issue. So, the author's desire to charge is based on their own judgment, but it's unclear if the business supports that. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're trying to address misuse, but the approach of charging without management's input could be problematic. However, the core issue is whether the author is wrong for wanting to take this action. If the business's policy allows for providing free water to everyone, then the author might be acting against that policy. But if the couple's behavior is indeed disruptive, the author has a valid concern. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to manage a situation where someone is misusing resources, but the method of charging might not be the best. However, the final decision should be made by the business owners or management. So, the author isn't in the wrong for having this desire, but they should probably follow proper channels.\n"
