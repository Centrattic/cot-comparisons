Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The situation is that the author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with homeless individuals, including a couple they find particularly bothersome. The author is conflicted about whether charging them for the cups is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is part of a business that already offers some level of assistance to the homeless, like water, restroom access, and even giving out cups. The main issue is with this specific couple who are taking advantage of these services in a way that the author perceives as disrespectful. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to manage resources responsibly and prevent what they see as abuse. They might feel that by charging, they can discourage the couple from overstaying and creating a mess. However, water is a basic necessity, and charging for it could be seen as denying a fundamental need to those who are homeless. Even if the cups are part of the cost, the act of providing water is generally considered a humanitarian gesture.\n\nThe business already offers other services to the homeless, so creating a policy where some are charged while others aren't might lead to inconsistency or unfair treatment. The other coworker doesn't charge, which might create confusion or resentment among the homeless individuals. Also, the author's personal feelings about the couple's behavior (like picking through ashtrays and leaving a mess) could be influencing their judgment, possibly leading to a discriminatory approach.\n\nBut then again, businesses have the right to set their own policies to protect their resources and maintain a respectful environment. If the couple is indeed causing a mess and overusing resources, the business might have valid concerns about sustainability and fairness to other customers. The key here is whether charging for the cups is an appropriate way to address these concerns or if there are better, more compassionate solutions.\n\nPerhaps the author could address the behavior directly, like politely asking the couple to clean up after themselves, or implementing a general policy that all customers need to pay for cups, regardless of their situation. That way, it's consistent and avoids singling out specific individuals. Alternatively, the business could look into providing free water in a more sustainable way, like a water station, to reduce the need for disposable cups.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the line between helping and being taken advantage of is blurry. While the author isn't outright refusing assistance, introducing a charge might be seen as a step too far, especially for something as basic as water. However, if the business is not a public service and has the right to manage its resources, the author might feel justified in wanting to set boundaries.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think the author is in a tough spot. Their intention to protect resources and maintain a certain standard is understandable, but the method they're considering (charging for water) could be ethically questionable. The answer might depend on the broader context of the business's policies and how they handle similar situations. But given the information, the author's desire to charge specifically for water might not be the most compassionate solution, especially when the couple is in a vulnerable situation. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong if their action is seen as denying a basic need. However, if the business has the right to set terms and the author's approach is part of a consistent policy, it might be justified. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and given the potential ethical implications of charging for water, I'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
