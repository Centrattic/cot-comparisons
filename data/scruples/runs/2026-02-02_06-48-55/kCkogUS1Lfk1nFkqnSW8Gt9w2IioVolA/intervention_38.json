      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario is they work at a bar/restaurant near a train station that gets a lot of homeless people. They generally don't mind giving out water, letting them use the restroom, etc., but there's this couple that comes every morning, messes up the bathrooms, picks through ashtrays, and asks for two cups of hot water. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they feel the couple is overstepping and taking advantage.\n\nHmm. The author is considering charging them, but they're unsure if they're being an asshole. The cups are compostable and more expensive, and the author isn't the one purchasing them. Their coworker gives the couple the cups without charging them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Charging homeless individuals for something as basic as water might seem harsh, especially since they're in a vulnerable situation. But the author mentions that the couple is being disrespectful by taking advantage of the hospitality. The key point here is whether the author's action is just a way to address the couple's behavior or if it's punishing them for their homelessness.\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in wanting to discourage the couple's disrespectful behavior. However, charging for water could be seen as targeting a homeless person's basic needs. The author isn't the one buying the cups, but they are enforcing a policy. Maybe the restaurant has an unwritten policy of providing free cups and water to everyone regardless of their behavior. If the author starts charging this couple, it might be inconsistent with that policy and could be perceived as discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the author's coworker isn't charging them, so the author's approach could create inconsistency. The author might be overstepping if the policy isn't set by management. It's possible that the author is taking on a role they're not supposed to, especially since they mention they're not the one purchasing the cups. This could lead to issues with coworker relations and management if they implement this without approval.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple's behavior is indeed problematic. They're causing a mess and taking more than others. The author might feel that this couple isn't respecting the establishment's resources. However, the solution of charging them might not be the right approach. Maybe there's a better way to address the behavior, like speaking to management about setting clearer boundaries or asking the couple politely to stop the inappropriate actions.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intention is to discourage the couple from overusing the services. But charging for water is a direct financial barrier, which could be seen as punishing them for their situation. It's possible that the couple can't afford to pay and might not even have the means to do so. So, even if the author's intention is to address the behavior, the method might be inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is trying to protect resources and establish boundaries. But the method they're considering might not be fair. The author could be in the wrong because they're targeting a specific group (homeless individuals) and adding a financial burden, which might not be a proportionate response to the issue. Instead, addressing the behavior through communication or management intervention would be more appropriate.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's desire to address the couple's behavior is understandable, but their proposed solution of charging for water is problematic. It could be seen as discriminatory and may not be the best approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're using a harsh measure that targets the homeless couple's basic needs instead of addressing the behavior through other means.\n"
