Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering charging homeless people for cups of water. The situation involves a couple who come in daily, misuse facilities, and take multiple cups of hot water. The author wants to start charging them, feeling they're taking advantage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business provides services like water and restroom access, which are often seen as basic necessities. The couple's behavior includes picking through ashtrays, not cleaning up, and taking two cups daily. These actions might be seen as disrespectful or overusing the resources provided.\n\nThe author feels that other homeless individuals don't exhibit such behavior and that this couple is overstepping. However, charging them could be problematic. It's a basic need, and people in need might not have alternatives. The cups are compostable and more expensive, but the cost isn't directly the author's. Still, the author's intention is to discourage the couple's behavior by charging.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social responsibility, businesses often have discretion in their policies. However, denying access to something as fundamental as water might be seen as inhumane, especially if the couple has no other means. The author's main issue is the behavior, not the act of providing water itself. Maybe addressing the behavior through other means, like setting boundaries or talking to them, could be more appropriate than charging. \n\nAlso, the author's coworker doesn't charge, so there's inconsistency. The author might be overstepping by trying to impose a charge based on personal discomfort rather than a business policy. The key question is whether the charge is a reasonable response to the behavior or a way to avoid compassion. \n\nIn summary, while the couple's actions are problematic, using charges for basic needs as a deterrent might be seen as the author's fault. It's a judgment call between enforcing respect for resources and upholding human dignity.\n"
