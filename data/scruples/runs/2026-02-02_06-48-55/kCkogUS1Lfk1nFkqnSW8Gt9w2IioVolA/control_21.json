Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The person works at a restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless people. They generally don't have a problem helping, but there's a specific couple they find problematic because of their messy behavior and picking through ashtrays. The couple gets two cups of hot water daily, which the author wants to charge them for since the cups are expensive. The author is conflicted about whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant is already providing some services to the homeless, like water and restroom access. The main issue is the couple's specific behavior. The author's coworker doesn't charge them, but the author feels they're overstepping. The question is whether wanting to charge them is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about the couple taking advantage of resources. The cups are compostable and costly, and the couple's actions (using the sink for showering, picking up cigarettes, leaving a mess) seem disrespectful. Charging for cups could discourage such behavior. The author isn't trying to profit but to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless individuals might be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation. If the water itself isn't being charged, just the cup, maybe the cost is minimal, but the principle is about access to basic needs. However, the couple's actions are abusive of the hospitality. The author is trying to balance kindness with setting limits on abuse.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being reasonable in their request. The author is not denying water but the cup, which is a resource that's costly. Since the couple is using the cups for personal use (oatmeal), which isn't a necessity like drinking water, charging for that might be fair. Plus, the couple's behavior is disrespectful, so the author is trying to address that.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of compassion. However, the author isn't cutting them off entirely but wants to set a boundary. It's about discouraging disrespectful behavior. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing misuse while still offering help to others.\n"
