Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a worker at a bar/restaurant who's considering charging homeless people for cups of water. The main issue is a couple that comes in daily, picks through ashtrays, uses the bathroom improperly, and takes two cups of hot water each morning. The author feels they're taking advantage and wants to charge them, but others in the workplace don't mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the couple is causing a mess and possibly misusing the facilities. The author is concerned about their behavior being disrespectful. On the other hand, charging for something as basic as water when the people are homeless could be seen as taking advantage of their vulnerability. The cups are compostable and more expensive, but the author isn't the one purchasing them. \n\nThe key points here are the couple's actions (messiness, picking through ashtrays) versus the author's response (charging for water). The author's coworkers don't have an issue, so there's a discrepancy in how the policy is applied. The author might be overstepping by trying to enforce a charge, especially if the business doesn't have a policy against it. \n\nAlso, from a human rights perspective, providing water is a basic need. Charging for it, even if the cups cost money, might be seen as inhumane. However, the couple's behavior (leaving messes, taking cigarettes) could justify some form of intervention, like setting boundaries or asking them to clean up. Charging for water might not be the right approach because it could be perceived as punitive and not addressing the root issue of their behavior. \n\nThe author's intention is to discourage the couple's actions. Maybe there are other ways to do that without charging for a basic necessity. For example, limiting the number of cups given, or asking them to clean up after themselves. Charging for water, which is a free resource, could be seen as inconsiderate, especially towards homeless individuals who already face many hardships. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for wanting to charge for water. They should address the couple's behavior directly instead of imposing a financial burden on them. The answer could be A, but I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The author's coworkers don't mind, but that doesn't mean the author is right. The main issue is the approach to handling the situation. Charging for water is a harsh measure that targets the couple's basic needs rather than their disrespectful behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
