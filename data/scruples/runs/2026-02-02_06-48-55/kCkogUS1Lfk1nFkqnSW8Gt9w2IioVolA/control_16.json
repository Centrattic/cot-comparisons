Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about charging homeless people for cups of water.\n\nThe author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station with a lot of homeless people. They usually don't mind helping out, like giving water or letting them use the restroom. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, does messy things like picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower, leaving a mess, and taking two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they feel it's disrespectful and over the top. They mention the cups are compostable and more expensive. They're conflicted because they help others but think this couple takes advantage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. On one hand, the couple's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014they're causing mess, maybe stealing cigarettes, and possibly using resources inappropriately. The author is worried about the cost of the cups, which are more expensive. On the other hand, charging homeless people could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation, even if the author's intention is to discourage bad behavior. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is wrong. If the couple is misusing the services, then the author might have a valid reason to set boundaries. However, charging for water could be seen as punitive. But the author isn't refusing service; they're adding a cost. Homelessness is a complex issue, and while the couple's actions are disrespectful, the author's response might be considered fair because they're setting rules for their own business. \n\nThe business isn't obligated to provide free resources, especially if certain individuals are abusing the system. The author is trying to discourage the couple's behavior, which is a reasonable approach. So, the answer might be that the author isn't wrong. But maybe there's a more compassionate way to handle it, like politely asking them to stop the mess or charging a small fee that's still affordable. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not the method. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect their business's resources from someone who's misusing them. The couple's actions are the problem, not the author's intent to charge. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
