Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and has a couple of homeless individuals coming in daily with problematic behavior. They want to start charging them for the cups used for hot water.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person mentions they're not opposed to helping homeless people but find this specific couple's behavior disrespectful. The couple is picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower, leaving messes, and taking two cups of hot water daily. The cups are compostable and more expensive. The person is conflicted because they feel the couple is taking advantage, but they're also worried about being an asshole.\n\nNow, the key here is whether charging them is justified. Charging for cups might seem like a small thing, but it's a way to set boundaries. However, providing water is a basic need. If they start charging, are they penalizing people who are homeless for basic necessities? On the other hand, the couple's behavior is causing extra costs and mess, so maybe it's reasonable to set some limits to prevent abuse of the hospitality offered.\n\nBut then again, if the establishment is open to others using the restroom or getting water, then charging one group might be seen as discriminatory. The couple's actions are indeed inconsiderate, but does that justify charging them? Maybe not. It's more about finding a way to address their behavior without cutting off access to a basic resource. Perhaps setting a policy that applies to everyone, like a small fee for cups to cover costs, or not allowing the sink-showering and enforcing cleanliness. \n\nThe person might be in the wrong if they're singling out this couple and using the charging as a way to push them away instead of addressing the behavior directly. It's possible that the couple is taking advantage, but the solution could be better communication or setting clear rules for everyone. Charging for cups might not be the right approach because it targets the people's poverty rather than their actions. \n\nAlternatively, if the cups are a significant cost, the business might need to adjust their policy for all customers to manage costs, but not specifically target the homeless. The line here is thin. The person is frustrated with the couple's behavior, but their solution might be misguided. Instead of charging for water, maybe they should talk to the couple about their behavior or involve management to create a policy that addresses the mess and overuse without penalizing the individuals for being homeless.\n"
