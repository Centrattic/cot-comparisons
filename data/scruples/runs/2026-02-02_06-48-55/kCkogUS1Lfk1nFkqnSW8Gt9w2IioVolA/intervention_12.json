      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless people. They generally don't mind giving water, using the restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, does some messy stuff like picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower, and asking for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they feel the couple is taking advantage and being disrespectful. They mention the cups are compostable and more expensive, and they're not the one buying them. The author works five days a week, and the other two days a coworker gives the cups without issue. The author is conflicted, thinking maybe they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the couple's actions. Picking through ashtrays for cigarettes sounds unsanitary and possibly against the establishment's rules. Using the sink as a shower would definitely damage the facilities and create hygiene issues. Leaving a mess is disrespectful to the staff and other customers. The hot water for oatmeal might seem like a small request, but if it's two cups every day, that adds up in terms of cups and resources. The author feels the couple is overstepping, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the author's intention to charge them. Charging for cups might be a way to set boundaries. However, the couple is homeless, so asking them to pay could be a financial burden. The author isn't directly responsible for the cup costs since the business covers that, but they still feel it's part of the couple's misuse. The question is whether charging them is fair or if the author is in the wrong for wanting to do so.\n\nOn one hand, the couple's behavior is problematic. On the other, charging someone in need for basic necessities might be seen as harsh. However, the business isn't obligated to provide free resources indefinitely if someone is using them in a way that's harmful or disrespectful. The author is trying to balance hospitality with maintaining appropriate use of the establishment's resources.\n\nThe key points are the couple's disrespectful behavior versus the author's right to set boundaries. If the couple is violating rules (like using the sink as a shower, making a mess), then the business can enforce policies. Charging for cups could be part of that enforcement. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to discourage such behavior, especially if it's impacting the business's operations. However, the approach should be considerate and fair. Maybe there's a middle ground, like politely explaining the rules or offering alternatives, but the author's intention to charge isn't inherently wrong given the context.\n"
