Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station, which gets a lot of homeless visitors. They generally don't have a problem with giving out water, restroom access, etc., but there's a specific couple that comes in daily, misbehaves (like picking through ashtrays, leaving messes in the bathroom), and asks for two cups of hot water each morning. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They're conflicted because they feel the couple is taking advantage and being disrespectful, but they're unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Charging people for basic necessities like water can be seen as inhumane, especially for those in vulnerable situations. The couple's behavior is problematic\u2014going through ashtrays and leaving messes\u2014but does that justify charging for cups? The author might feel they're being respectful by offering services, but when others take advantage, it could be seen as unfair. However, setting a precedent of charging only some people might be discriminatory or punitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing a service that others are using without issue. The couple in question is overstepping by their actions, which could be considered disrespectful. The author's coworkers don't charge, but the author is considering it to deter this behavior. The key point is whether charging for cups is a reasonable way to address the couple's behavior or if it's an excessive reaction that targets the wrong people.\n\nAnother angle: if the cups are a cost to the business, maybe the author should discuss with management to implement a policy that applies to everyone, not just the problematic couple. Charging only them might look like punishment. However, if the couple is genuinely misusing resources, the business might need to set boundaries. But water is a basic need, so charging for it could be seen as wrong regardless of the couple's behavior.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're not the one buying the cups, so maybe they're trying to shift responsibility. But the ethical decision lies in whether it's right to charge someone for water, regardless of who covers the cost. The problem is balancing compassion with setting limits to prevent abuse of resources. \n\nIn some cases, businesses might have policies to deny service to those who misbehave, but charging for cups specifically might not be the best approach. It might be more appropriate to address the behavior directly, like asking them to stop searching ashtrays or cleaning up after themselves, rather than charging for cups. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author wants to charge to discourage misuse, but water is a necessity. Charging for cups could be seen as punitive and inhumane, especially when the alternative is to address the misuse directly. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're targeting a basic need as a penalty for behavior issues instead of handling the behavior itself.\n"
