Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning.

Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water because of their behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station. They get a lot of homeless people, and generally, they don't mind helping out\u2014water, restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, does messy things like picking through ashtrays, using the shower in the sink, and taking two cups of hot water for their oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage and being disrespectful.\n\nThe author wonders if they're being an asshole by considering charging them. Their coworker gives the cups without charging, and they're conflicted.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Charging people for something they expect to be free could be seen as a way to enforce respect or boundaries. The couple's behavior is indeed problematic\u2014sinking in the bathroom, leaving messes, picking through ashtrays. These actions might be considered disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially in a public space like a business.\n\nHowever, the ethical angle is important here. The couple is homeless, so they're in a vulnerable situation. Charging for cups might be a way to set boundaries against misuse, but it could also be seen as punishing them for their circumstances. The key is whether the charge is a reasonable boundary or if it's exploiting their vulnerability.\n\nThe author isn't the one purchasing the cups, but they're the one implementing the policy. The business could have rules against misuse, but the author is taking it upon themselves to charge individuals. If the business has a policy against such behavior, maybe the author should follow that. But since they're acting individually, it's more about personal ethics.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to discourage disrespectful behavior. On the other, they're imposing a financial burden on people who are already in a difficult situation. Charging might not address the root issue and could be seen as punitive rather than supportive. However, the couple's actions are affecting the business's resources and environment.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. If the author is standing up for the company's rules and their own comfort, that's understandable. But if they're using the charge as a way to exclude or penalize someone based on their homelessness, that's problematic. The key is whether the charge is a fair response to specific misuse or a broader judgment about the couple's status.\n\nIn conclusion, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because they're trying to set boundaries against misuse. But it's a nuanced situation where the approach could be seen as harsh. The answer might depend on whether there's a policy in place or if the author is taking unilateral action. Since the business's policy isn't mentioned, the author's personal decision to charge could be seen as in the wrong, especially if it targets individuals based on their homelessness rather than their specific actions.\n"
