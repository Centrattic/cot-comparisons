Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a bar/restaurant worker who's considering charging homeless people for cups of water because of their behavior. The couple in question picks through ashtrays, messes up the bathrooms, and takes two cups of hot water every morning. The author feels they're taking advantage and wants to start charging them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business is already providing some services for free, like water and restroom access, which is common for many places to offer to people in need. The author isn't opposed to helping in general but has specific issues with this couple's behavior. The key here is whether charging them for cups is a reasonable response to their actions.\n\nThe couple's actions\u2014like picking through ashtrays and leaving a mess\u2014could be seen as violating the terms of being a guest. If the business has rules about not taking items or using facilities in a certain way, then the couple is breaking those rules. Charging them might be a way to enforce those rules and set boundaries. However, water itself is a basic necessity, and charging for it might be seen as unethical, especially for people in a vulnerable position. The cups are compostable and more expensive, but the water is free, so the cost is minimal. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consistency. Other staff members give out cups without charging, so the author's approach might create inconsistency in how the policy is applied. The author is trying to discourage the couple's behavior, which could be a valid reason to set a boundary. However, using a financial penalty (charging) might be too harsh. Maybe there are other ways to address the behavior, like speaking to them politely or limiting the number of cups given, without resorting to charging. \n\nAnother angle is the business's policy. If the business doesn't have a policy against this behavior, the author is taking unilateral action which might not align with company guidelines. The author should probably discuss this with management first to establish a consistent policy rather than implementing their own. \n\nAlso, the concept of respecting people's dignity comes into play. Charging someone who is homeless for a basic necessity like water could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation. Even if the couple is misbehaving, there's a fine line between setting boundaries and being punitive. The author's intention is to discourage misuse, but the method might not be the most compassionate approach. \n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about the couple's behavior, the solution of charging them for cups might be crossing ethical boundaries. There could be better, more compassionate ways to address the issue without penalizing someone who is already in a difficult situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for wanting to charge them, even if their intention is to enforce boundaries.\n"
