Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something.

Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario involves a couple that comes in every morning, misuses resources, and leaves a mess. The author feels they're taking advantage.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The couple is using ashtrays for cigarettes, using the shower improperly, and taking two cups of hot water daily. The cups are compostable and more expensive. The author is part of a staff that usually helps homeless people but is now considering charging this couple. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the main issue is whether it's fair to charge someone in need. Charging for water, especially when they're homeless, could be seen as exploiting their situation. However, the couple's behavior (misusing facilities, creating messes) might justify some form of boundary. \n\nBut the author's justification is that the couple is disrespectful. Is it right to penalize them by charging for something as basic as water? Also, the couple isn't a customer; they're getting services as a favor. Charging them could be seen as a form of punishment, which might not be appropriate unless there's a clear policy in place. \n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a team. If other staff don't charge, the author might be creating inconsistency. Plus, the cups are the company's responsibility, not the author's. So, is the author overstepping by trying to implement a charge without management's input?\n\nThe author's intention is to discourage misuse, which is understandable. But the method\u2014charging for water\u2014could be seen as punitive without addressing the root issue. Maybe there are other ways to handle the mess and misuse, like setting clearer rules or involving management. \n\nIn terms of empathy, homeless individuals often face significant challenges. Charging them extra for essentials might not be the best approach. However, the couple's actions are indeed problematic. It's a balance between compassion and setting boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's desire to charge might come from a place of frustration, but the action could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (Option A). But maybe not entirely. Alternatively, if the couple's behavior is genuinely disruptive, maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is part of a business that offers these services, and the couple is using them inappropriately, the business might have policies to address misuse. If the author is acting without management's approval, that could be an issue. Charging them directly for cups might be against the company's policy or the spirit of their hospitality. \n\nAlso, the cost of the cups is likely a business expense. The author isn't personally paying; it's the company. So, charging the couple might be an overreach and not a fair way to handle the situation. The author should probably discuss this with management instead of unilaterally deciding to charge. \n\nGiven all that, the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge the homeless individuals for something they're already providing as a courtesy, especially without addressing the misuse through proper channels. So the answer would be A.\n"
