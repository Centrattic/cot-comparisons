Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to charge homeless people for cups of water is in the wrong. The scenario is that they work at a bar/restaurant next to a train station and get a lot of homeless customers. The main issue is with a specific couple who come every morning, take advantage of the services, and leave a mess. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is overstepping, but they're unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The person is providing water, which is a basic necessity. Charging for cups might be seen as exploiting a vulnerable group. On the other hand, the couple's behavior is described as disrespectful\u2014picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower, leaving messes. The author isn't the one buying the cups, but they still want to charge based on the couple's behavior.\n\nThe author distinguishes between the couple and other homeless individuals who come less frequently and don't cause issues. They also mention a coworker who gives the cups without charging. So there's inconsistency in the policy. The author's main argument is about discouraging disrespectful behavior, but charging for water might not address the root issue and could be seen as punitive towards people in need.\n\nAnother angle: if the business is already providing these services for free, setting a policy to charge certain people might be unfair. The couple might not have alternatives, so the business's policy could be seen as taking advantage. However, the author could instead address the mess and behavior through other means, like talking to them or setting clear expectations, rather than charging for essentials.\n\nAlso, the question of whether the author is in the wrong hinges on intent and action. The author's intent is to discourage misuse, but the action of charging for water, a necessity, could be considered wrong regardless of intent. There's a balance between maintaining reasonable standards and ensuring access to basic needs for those in need.\n\nIn conclusion, while the couple's actions are problematic, the author's method of response (charging for water) might be inconsiderate and not the most ethical approach. The business could address the mess without charging for the water cups, perhaps by politely setting boundaries or implementing a policy that applies to everyone equally. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
