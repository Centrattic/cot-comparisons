      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask the World (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves someone working at a bar/restaurant near a train station, which gets a lot of homeless people. The main issue is a couple that comes in every morning, takes advantage of resources like using the bathroom inappropriately, and takes cups of hot water. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they generally don't mind helping the homeless with water, restroom access, etc., but this particular couple's behavior is problematic. The couple is described as picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, using the bathroom in a way that's inappropriate (sink-showering), and leaving a mess. They also take two cups of hot water every morning. The author feels that this couple is taking advantage of the hospitality and overstepping, hence wanting to charge them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (they are in the wrong) or B (they are not). I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives.\n\nOn one hand, the business provides services to the homeless, which is a compassionate act. However, the couple in question is misusing those services. The author isn't charging other homeless individuals, but specifically this couple due to their behavior. The cups are a business expense, and if the couple is using two each time, that adds up. The author might feel that charging them is a way to set boundaries and prevent misuse.\n\nOn the other hand, charging someone who can't afford it might be seen as cruel, especially if they're homeless. The author mentions that the cups are compostable and more expensive, so the cost is higher. However, the couple's actions are causing the business additional expenses and cleaning up messes. The author isn't cutting off all homeless people but is targeting this specific couple, which could be justified as enforcing rules.\n\nThe key points here are the couple's behavior versus the author's right to enforce policies. If the business has a policy that allows free water but expects respectful use, then the couple's misuse could be a violation. Charging them might be a way to enforce that policy. However, if the business doesn't have such policies in place, the author might be overstepping by applying a charge selectively.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is the one working the morning shift and has been giving the cups until now. The coworker on other days gives them freely. The author is conflicted about changing the policy. Charging them could be seen as a reasonable measure to prevent abuse, especially if the couple's actions are causing more work for the staff and increasing costs.\n\nBut there's also the ethical consideration: is it fair to charge someone in need when they can't pay? However, the author isn't denying them water entirely but is introducing a cost, which might act as a deterrent for the couple's behavior. It's a balance between compassion and practical business management.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that it's inhumane to charge homeless individuals, while others might support setting boundaries to prevent exploitation of resources. The author's intent is to discourage disrespect and misuse, not to harm the couple. The fact that the author is conflicted shows they're considering both sides.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's actions are a response to misuse of resources by a specific group, not a blanket policy against all homeless people. The charging of cups is a way to set boundaries, which is a business's right to manage their resources. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if there's no prior policy in place, implementing a charge could be seen as harsh. But given the couple's behavior, it's a justified measure. So the answer would likely be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
