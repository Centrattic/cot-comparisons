Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote about wanting to charge homeless people for water cups is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple of homeless people coming in every morning, using resources like picking through ashtrays, using the bathroom in a messy way, and asking for two cups of hot water daily. The employee feels they're taking advantage and wants to charge them. Others come in less frequently and don't do these things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the business isn't obligated to provide free services to anyone. They can set their own rules about using their facilities. The couple's behavior\u2014picking through ashtrays and leaving a mess\u2014might be seen as disrespectful, which could justify the employee's feelings. However, the couple is homeless, and hot water for oatmeal might be a basic need for them. Charging them for the cups could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation, especially since the cups are more expensive because they're compostable. The employee isn't personally buying them but wants to charge others, which might place a financial burden on people who can't afford it.\n\nOn the other hand, the business might argue that they can set boundaries to prevent misuse of their resources. If others use the services without causing issues, but this couple's actions are disruptive, the business might have a right to enforce policies. However, the approach of charging them specifically could be problematic because it singles out a specific group, which might be discriminatory. It's possible that the business should address the behavior (like the mess) rather than the person's homelessness. Maybe implementing a policy that applies to everyone, like a fee for water cups, or asking for a small donation, but that might still not be fair to the homeless.\n\nAnother angle is empathy. The couple might be doing what they can to survive, and the actions described (like picking through ashtrays) could be out of necessity, not disrespect. The employee might perceive it as disrespectful, but the couple might not have other options. Charging for water could deprive them of a basic need. However, the employee has the right to protect the business's resources. It's a balance between compassion and business needs.\n\nAlso, the fact that another coworker doesn't charge them might indicate inconsistency in how the policy is applied. The employee is considering changing that, but maybe the business should have clear guidelines. If the business is providing these services as part of their community outreach, then the employee might be within their rights to enforce rules. But if they're doing it out of kindness, charging specific people might contradict that mission.\n\nIn terms of the law, there might not be a legal obligation to provide free water, but there are social and ethical implications. The employee is in a position where they have to make a judgment call. The key factors are the couple's behavior versus the needs of the homeless, and whether charging them is a fair way to address the problem. The employee's intention to discourage the couple's behavior by charging might be a way to set boundaries, but it could also be seen as cruel or unjust.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might depend on whether the charging is a reasonable boundary or an unfair targeting. If the business's policy is to provide free water to all, then charging specific people could be in the wrong. However, if the business decides to implement a policy where water is not freely given, especially when there's misuse, then the employee might not be wrong. The couple's actions do contribute to the problem, but the response should consider their vulnerability. Therefore, the employee's intention isn't necessarily malicious, but the method might be questionable. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points, making it hard to say definitively if the author is in the wrong. But leaning towards \"not in the wrong\" because they're trying to enforce boundaries, but with some ethical considerations.\n"
