Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water is in the wrong. The situation is that there's a couple who come in every morning, do some questionable things like picking through ashtrays, using the bathroom inappropriately, and taking two cups of hot water. The author feels they're overstepping and wants to charge them for the cups.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the homeless individuals might be in a vulnerable position, and the bar/restaurant has been offering basic amenities. The couple in question might be taking advantage, but are they necessarily in the wrong? The author mentions they leave a mess and take more than others, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, charging them for water might be a way to set boundaries.\n\nBut wait, charging them could also be seen as exploiting their situation. If the cups are expensive, adding that cost could be a burden. The author says they're not the one buying the cups, but they still feel it's their responsibility. There's also the aspect of consistency\u2014others on different shifts don't charge, so maybe the author is being inconsistent.\n\nAnother angle is the definition of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole). The community usually looks at intent and impact. The author's intent is to discourage disrespectful behavior, which might be understandable. But the impact is that the couple, who might have no other options, are being charged for basic needs. That could be seen as harsh.\n\nBut then again, the couple's behavior (sinking showering, picking through trash) is clearly inappropriate. The author has every right to set rules to prevent misuse. However, charging them for cups might not be the best approach. Maybe other measures like limiting the number of cups or addressing the mess directly would be better.\n\nSo the question is, is charging for cups a reasonable boundary or an unfair punishment? If the cups are part of the service they're providing, and the couple is using it excessively, maybe it's reasonable. But since it's water, which is a basic need, charging could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's coworker doesn't charge, so maybe the author is overstepping by imposing a different rule.\n\nIn the end, the answer depends on balancing the right to set boundaries against compassion. The author's actions might be justified in maintaining their business's rules, but the method (charging) could be seen as harsh. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to address misuse, even if the method is debatable.\n"
