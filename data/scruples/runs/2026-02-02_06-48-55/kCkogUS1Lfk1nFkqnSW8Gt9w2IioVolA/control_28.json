      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. They work at a bar/restaurant near a train station. They generally help homeless people by giving water and using the restroom, but there's a specific couple that comes in every morning. This couple picks through ashtrays, uses the sink like a shower, leaves a mess, and asks for two cups of hot water each day. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they're compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage and overstepping, while other homeless people are helped without issues. The coworker gives the cups without charging, but the author is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the couple's behavior is problematic. They're picking through ashtrays, which is unsanitary and potentially against rules. Using the sink as a shower and leaving a mess is disruptive. The author is trying to discourage this by charging for the cups. The cups are a cost to the business, and the couple's daily visits add up. \n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless people for water could be seen as adding a burden on those in need. But the author isn't denying water entirely; they're asking for payment. The key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable measure to address the misuse. \n\nThe author is not the one purchasing the cups, but they feel it's their responsibility to set boundaries. The business might have policies, but since they're not mentioned, it's unclear. However, the issue is about the author's personal stance. \n\nIf the couple's actions are causing a mess and the author is trying to prevent that, charging might be a way to deter them. But is it fair to charge people who can't afford it? That's a tricky point. However, the author isn't refusing them service; they're just requiring payment. If the couple can't pay, they might stop coming, which could reduce the mess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should address the mess issue first, like asking the couple to clean up after using the sink, before implementing a charge. But the author feels they're overstepping. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to set boundaries for their own comfort and the business's sake. The couple's behavior is disruptive, and charging for cups is a way to manage that. It's a business decision to protect resources, even if it's a small charge. So the answer might be B.\n"
