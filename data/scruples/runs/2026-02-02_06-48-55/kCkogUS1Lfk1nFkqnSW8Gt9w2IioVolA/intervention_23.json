Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and often interacts with homeless people. They mention that they generally don't mind helping by giving water, letting them use the restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, picks through ashtrays, uses the bathroom inappropriately, and takes two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage and overstepping, while other homeless individuals are fine. The coworker on the other days gives the cups without issue, but the author is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole by wanting to charge.\n\nSo, the key points here are the actions of the couple versus the general policy. The author is okay with helping but feels targeted because of the couple's specific behaviors. The question is whether charging for water in this context is wrong. \n\nFirst, consider the ethical aspect. The couple's actions\u2014picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower, leaving a mess\u2014are clearly problematic. Those actions could be seen as disrespectful and overusing the establishment's resources. Charging for the cups might be a way to deter such behavior, not just the water itself. The author isn't trying to deny water for survival but to prevent misuse. However, charging for something that's generally free could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable population if the intent wasn't to address the misuse.\n\nOn the other hand, the establishment isn't obligated to provide services to anyone, homeless or not. If the couple is causing a mess and taking more than others, setting boundaries is reasonable. Charging for the cups could be a way to enforce that without being hostile. The cups are a cost to the business, so asking for payment when someone is using them excessively (two cups daily) might be justified. The author isn't refusing service but adding a cost to discourage misuse, which is a common practice in many businesses.\n\nBut there's also a social responsibility angle. While the couple's behavior is a problem, charging them might be seen as targeting the poor. However, the author isn't denying water entirely but addressing the specific misuse. The compostable cups are a business expense, and if someone is using them excessively without contributing to that cost, it's reasonable to charge. The key is whether the charge is directly tied to the excessive use rather than just the act of getting water.\n\nIn summary, the author's intent is to address the couple's disrespectful behavior, not to prevent them from getting water. Charging as a deterrent for misuse is a way to set boundaries, which could be seen as fair. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
