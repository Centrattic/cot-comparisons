Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The situation is a bit complex. The author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless people. They've been giving out water, letting them use the restroom, etc., but there's a couple that comes every morning and takes a lot of cups, leaves a mess, and picks through ashtrays.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a regular employee, so they might not have the authority to charge people for the cups. The cups are compostable, which are more expensive, and the business isn't the one purchasing them. So maybe there's a cost involved that the business doesn't want to cover for certain individuals.\n\nThe couple's behavior is described as picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, using the bathroom in a way that leaves a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water every day. The author feels they're taking advantage. But others, like the coworker on different shifts, don't mind giving them the cups. The author is conflicted between their own feelings and the company's policy. \n\nI should think about the ethics here. Charging homeless people for something as basic as water could be seen as unkind or exploiting their situation. However, if the couple is misusing resources and creating a mess, maybe the business has a right to set boundaries. But the key point is whether the couple is violating the business's rules. If the business allows free water for everyone, the author can't single out this couple. If the business hasn't set clear rules, the author might be overstepping by trying to charge them.\n\nAlso, the author's coworker doesn't have the same issue, so there's inconsistency. The author might be right in wanting to discourage misuse, but the method of charging could be problematic. Perhaps there's a better way, like talking to management about setting a policy or asking for donations instead of charging. Charging people in need might not be the best approach and could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for wanting to charge them directly instead of addressing the issue through proper channels or finding a more compassionate solution.\n"
