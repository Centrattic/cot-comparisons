Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station, which gets a lot of homeless people. They generally don't mind giving out water, restroom access, etc. But there's a couple that comes every morning, takes cigarettes from the ashtrays, uses the sink like a shower (which is a mess), and asks for two cups of hot water. The cups are compostable and more expensive. The author wants to charge them for the cups, thinking they're taking advantage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The couple's behavior includes picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, which is stealing. Using the sink as a shower and leaving a mess is disrespectful to the establishment. The author isn't the one buying the cups but feels the couple is overstepping. The other coworker gives the cups without charge, but the author wants to change that.\n\nIs it fair to charge them? Well, if the establishment provides free water to others, charging this couple specifically might be seen as discriminatory. However, the couple's actions (stealing, creating messes) are problematic. The author isn't denying them water entirely but wants to set a policy to discourage misuse. The key here is whether charging them is a reasonable response to their specific behavior.\n\nThe author might be in the right because they're trying to set boundaries against misuse. However, charging the couple while others get free water could be seen as unfair. But since the couple's actions are different (stealing, mess), maybe it's justified. Alternatively, maybe the author should address the stealing and mess first before charging for cups. The dilemma is about balancing compassion with setting reasonable policies. If the couple isn't respecting the establishment, then charging them could be a way to enforce respect. But if others are treated differently, it's inconsistent. However, the author isn't saying to charge all homeless people, just this couple. So maybe it's okay.\n"
