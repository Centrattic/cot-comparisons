Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about charging homeless people for cups of water.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station. They get a lot of homeless people, but one couple comes in every morning and behaves in a way that's seen as disrespectful\u2014picking through ashtrays, leaving a mess, asking for two cups of hot water for oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage of the hospitality and oversteys their welcome. Others are okay with giving the cups, but the author isn't sure if they're being an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Charging homeless individuals for basic necessities can be a sensitive issue. Water is generally a necessity, and charging for it might be seen as unkind, especially if they can't afford it. However, the couple's behavior is problematic. They're not just taking water; they're also misusing the facilities, creating mess, and possibly stealing cigarettes. The author isn't against helping homeless people in general, but this couple's actions are crossing a line.\n\nThe key points here are the behavior of the couple versus the author's response. If the establishment's policy is to provide free water, then charging a specific group could be discriminatory. However, if the couple is misusing resources and causing issues, it's reasonable to address that behavior without punishing them with a charge they can't pay. Maybe there are other ways to handle it, like setting boundaries or talking to the couple about their behavior. Charging them might not be the most effective solution and could be seen as punitive without addressing the root of the problem.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that other coworkers give the cups without issue. The author is conflicted between their own feelings and the existing practice. Maybe the author should discuss with management to find a policy that addresses resource misuse without being punitive towards the homeless. Charging homeless people for water could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation, especially if they can't pay and it's a necessity. The author might be justified in wanting to prevent abuse, but the method (charging) could be inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the couple's behavior is problematic, the author's solution of charging them for cups might be seen as inconsiderate. The author could be in the wrong if their approach targets specific individuals in a vulnerable group without addressing the behavior through other means. However, if the author's intent is to stop abuse of the facility, there might be some justification. But ethically, charging homeless people for water, a basic need, is questionable regardless of their behavior. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
