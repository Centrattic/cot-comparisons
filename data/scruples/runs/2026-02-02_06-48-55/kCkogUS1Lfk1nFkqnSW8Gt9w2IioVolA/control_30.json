Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station, which gets a lot of homeless people. They generally help out, like giving water, restroom access, and having chats. But there's this couple that comes every morning, does some questionable things like picking through ashtrays, using the sink as a shower and leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they feel it's disrespectful and they're taking advantage.\n\nFirst, the couple's behavior is a problem. Picking through ashtrays and using the sink as a shower is definitely not acceptable and shows a lack of respect. The author is trying to set boundaries here. They mention that the cups are compostable and more expensive, which adds to the cost. The coworker on other shifts gives the cups without charging, but the author is considering changing that to discourage the behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the couple's actions versus the author's response. The author isn't denying them basic needs like water but wants to stop the couple from exploiting the hospitality. Charging for cups could be a way to enforce rules and reduce the couple's negative impact without completely cutting them off. The author is also aware that others might see this as harsh, so they're questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, providing free water is a common practice, and charging might be seen as inhumane. On the other hand, the couple's behavior is disruptive and disrespectful. The author is trying to balance helping others while maintaining the dignity and comfort of everyone in the establishment. Since the couple isn't just asking for water but engaging in problematic actions, the author's desire to set boundaries is understandable. The answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong because they're addressing specific issues caused by the couple rather than just denying help.\n"
