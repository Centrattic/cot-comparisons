      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person writing this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThey work at a bar/restaurant near a train station. They get a lot of homeless people, which they don't mind. They help out by giving water, letting them use the restroom, etc. But there's a couple that comes in every morning. The couple does some things that bother the author: picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, using the sink like a shower, leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water daily for oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They acknowledge they don't buy the cups but feel the couple is taking advantage. They work with a coworker who gives the cups without issue, but the author is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about the couple's behavior. The actions mentioned\u2014picking through ashtrays (which is unsanitary and possibly stealing if the cigarettes are not properly disposed), using the sink as a shower when there's no facility for that, and leaving messes\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. The author is trying to set boundaries by potentially charging for the cups. \n\nBut the couple is homeless, so they might be in a vulnerable situation. Charging them for something basic like hot water could be problematic. The author is balancing between maintaining their business's policies and showing compassion. However, the author is not the one purchasing the cups, so they might not be directly responsible for the cost. The coworker isn't charging, which adds to the inconsistency.\n\nIs charging for the cups an appropriate response? If the couple's behavior is indeed disruptive, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. However, the action of charging for a basic need like water could be seen as punitive. Maybe there are other ways to address the mess and inappropriate use of facilities first. The author's main issue is the couple's behavior, not the act of giving water per se. So perhaps the author is trying to find a way to deter the couple without being outright hostile. But is charging for cups a fair way to do that? It might be seen as targeting them specifically, which could be unfair if others aren't being charged. The coworker's approach is different, which might indicate that the author's approach is more stringent than necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple is causing consistent issues, the author has a right to protect their business environment. The problem is whether charging for cups is a proportionate response. If the cups are expensive, even if the business isn't directly paying, the author might be concerned about costs. But the couple's needs might outweigh that if they're truly in a difficult situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is trying to address a problem caused by the couple's behavior. However, charging for cups could be seen as an unfair punishment, especially for a basic necessity. The author might need to address the mess and misuse of facilities first before implementing a charge. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for wanting to charge for something essential as a way to deter the couple, rather than addressing the underlying issues through other means. Alternatively, if the business has policies against such behavior, enforcing them could be better. But since the author is considering charging for cups specifically, which is a basic need, that action might be seen as harsh. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
