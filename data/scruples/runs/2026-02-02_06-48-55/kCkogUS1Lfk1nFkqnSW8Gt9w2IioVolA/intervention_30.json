Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at a place that gets a lot of homeless people. They generally aren't a problem, but there's a specific couple that comes in daily. These two are described as picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, using the sink as a shower, leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water each morning. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They mention that other homeless individuals come in occasionally, and they don't mind helping them, but this couple's behavior seems disrespectful. The coworker on the other days gives the cups for free, but the author feels the need to set a boundary.\n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is providing a service (water) that others use without charge. If the couple is using excessive resources and being disrespectful, maybe setting a boundary is reasonable. On the other hand, charging homeless people might be seen as exploiting their situation, especially if they're in need. However, the author isn't asking for money but to pay for the cups, which could be a way to reduce the burden without turning them away.\n\nThe key points here are the couple's behavior versus the author's intention. The author is trying to discourage misuse of resources and maintain cleanliness. Charging for cups might be a way to do that without being hostile. However, it's important to consider if this action is discriminatory or if there's a better way to address the mess and misuse. Maybe the author could address the behavior directly instead of charging.\n\nBut the question is about whether they're in the wrong. If the author's actions are a reasonable response to misuse, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if charging homeless people is inherently unfair, that could be the case. The answer depends on whether the action is a proportionate response to the problem. Since the author is not denying service entirely but trying to set limits to prevent abuse, it might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
