Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless people. They\u2019re okay with giving water, restroom access, etc., but there's a specific couple that comes every morning. The couple picks through ashtrays, uses the sink for showers, leaves a mess, and asks for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to charge them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage and overstepping. The author is unsure if they\u2019re being an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the behavior of the couple versus the author's response. The author is concerned about the couple's actions\u2014picking through ashtrays, sink-showering, creating a mess, and taking two cups a day. These actions might be seen as disrespectful or exploitative. The author wants to charge for the cups to discourage this behavior.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Charging for water is a basic necessity. However, the couple isn't just taking water; they're creating a mess and possibly engaging in behavior that's against the establishment's policies. The author isn't being cruel by denying them water entirely but is trying to set a boundary by charging. The question is whether charging is justified given the couple's actions.\n\nOn one hand, the couple is using the services in a way that's disrespectful to the establishment. On the other, charging for water could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable group. But since the author is offering the cups for a fee, it's a way to enforce some rules without completely cutting them off. The author isn't refusing them out of hand but is trying to manage the situation by introducing a cost, which might deter the couple from continuing their current behavior.\n\nThe other employees might not mind, but the author is trying to maintain the establishment's standards. It's about balancing compassion with the need to prevent abuse of services. The author's intention isn't to harm but to set boundaries. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B.\n"
