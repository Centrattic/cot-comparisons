Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to charge a homeless couple for cups of water. The post describes a situation where the couple comes in every morning, goes through ashtrays, uses the bathroom inappropriately, and takes two cups of hot water daily. The author feels they're taking advantage and overstay their welcome, so they want to start charging. Other homeless individuals come less frequently and there's no problem with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Charging for hot water and cups\u2014water is a basic need, right? But if the couple is being disrespectful by picking through ashtrays and misusing the bathroom, that's a problem. The author mentions compostable cups are more expensive, but they're not the one buying them. The main issue is the couple's behavior, not the cost per se. \n\nOn one hand, the author is providing services (water, restroom) to others without charge, which is a kind gesture. But the couple's actions might be contributing to higher costs or creating an environment that's not hygienic. The author could be trying to set boundaries to prevent abuse of the service. However, water is a necessity, and charging for it, even if the cups are expensive, might be seen as inhumane, especially for people in need. \n\nBut the couple's behavior is definitely problematic. They're picking through ashtrays, which is unsanitary and could be stealing (since cigarettes are not free). The bathroom misuse is another red flag. The author might feel that these actions justify different treatment. So, maybe the author is trying to enforce their own rules to stop that behavior. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If they charge the couple while others are allowed to take water for free, that could be discriminatory. The couple might not have the means to pay, so it's a moral issue. But the couple's behavior is also a consideration. The author could be trying to address the disrespect without turning them away entirely. \n\nI think the key here is the couple's actions versus the author's response. The author is concerned about the couple's misuse of resources and their overstay. Charging them might be a way to set boundaries, but it's a bit harsh given that water is a basic need. Maybe there are other ways to handle it without charging, like politely asking them to stop the inappropriate behaviors or setting a time limit. \n\nBut if the author is only charging this specific couple, it's unfair. However, if they're charging all homeless people for the cups, that's a different angle. The post says the other coworker gives them the cups without charge, so the author is considering changing the policy for this couple. That might be seen as inconsistent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the couple is being disrespectful, the author's solution of charging might not be the best. It's possible that the author is in the right to set boundaries against misuse, but wrong in targeting the couple for a necessity like water. Maybe a better approach is to address the specific behaviors without penalizing by charging. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the focus is on stopping the misuse and setting boundaries. But if the focus is on charging for a necessity when others aren't charged, then A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The post seems to suggest that the couple is taking advantage, so the author's intent is to discourage that. However, charging for water is a basic need, so it's a bit of a minefield. \n\nI need to weigh the author's right to enforce their business's rules against the moral obligation to provide basic needs. The couple's actions are clearly against the rules, so the author might be justified in taking some action. Charging for the cups could be a way to do that, but it's a gray area. The author isn't asking to turn them away, just to charge for the cups. The other days, the coworker doesn't charge, so the author's approach is inconsistent. \n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they're addressing disrespectful behavior and trying to maintain the business's standards. But I also see the other side where charging for water is a necessity. The key is the couple's actions versus the author's response. The author is trying to draw a line, which is reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
