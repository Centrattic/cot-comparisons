Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about charging homeless people for cups of water. The author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and has a couple of homeless individuals coming in every morning. The couple is described as picking through ashtrays, using the bathroom inappropriately, and taking two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They mention that other homeless people come in less frequently and don't have such issues, but this couple's behavior is seen as disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if charging for the cups is justified. The key points here are the couple's behavior versus the author's desire to maintain hospitality. The author isn't the one buying the cups, but they feel the couple is taking advantage. The other coworker gives them cups without charge, but the author wants to change that.\n\nI should consider whether the couple's actions constitute misuse of resources. If they are using the bathroom inappropriately and creating a mess, maybe there's a valid reason to set boundaries. However, charging for water, especially to homeless individuals, might be seen as harsh. The author is balancing between maintaining a welcoming environment and preventing abuse.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Charging for basic necessities like water could be problematic, especially for those in need. However, if the couple is misusing the facilities and causing more work, the author might feel they need to enforce rules. The question is about fairness and the ethical stance. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that other homeless people come in occasionally and don't have these issues. The couple in question is overusing the resources and being disrespectful. Charging them for the cups might be a way to discourage their behavior. However, it's important to consider that homeless individuals may not have alternatives and that charging could prevent them from accessing essentials.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't asking them to leave entirely but wants to set a boundary. The compostable cups are more expensive, so maybe there's a cost justification. The author's coworker isn't charging, so there's inconsistency. The author's concern is about respect and overuse. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, providing water is a basic act of kindness. Charging might seem harsh, but if the couple is being disrespectful, perhaps the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the decision to charge could be seen as punitive. Maybe there's a middle ground, like politely explaining the new policy without charging, or offering alternative assistance. \n\nSo, the author's intention is to discourage misuse, but the method of charging might be problematic. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the approach. If they're charging without alternatives, it might be considered wrong. But if they're trying to enforce rules due to misuse, maybe not. The balance between compassion and accountability is key here.\n"
