      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThey work at a bar/restaurant near a train station and mentioned that a lot of homeless people come in. They usually don't mind giving away water, letting them use the restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning. The couple does things like picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, using the sink like a shower and leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups. The cups are compostable and more expensive. They're not the one buying the cups but feel the couple is taking advantage. They note that other homeless people come in a few times a week, and they don't mind helping those folks, but this couple's behavior is disrespectful. They work mornings five days a week, and another coworker gives the couple cups without issue. They're conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by wanting to charge the couple for the cups. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple's behavior: picking through ashtrays for cigarettes. That's probably not allowed. If the ashes are in the ashtrays, maybe they're not supposed to be taken. Then, using the sink as a shower and leaving a mess. That's definitely a problem because it creates extra work for the staff and could be unsanitary. Asking for two cups of hot water daily. The author is concerned about the cost of compostable cups, which are more expensive. They want to charge the couple to discourage their behavior.\n\nThe author isn't the owner, so they might need to get permission to charge. But the main issue is whether it's fair or right to do so. On one hand, the couple is using resources (cups) and not maintaining the space (messy bathroom). On the other hand, the couple is homeless, so charging them might seem harsh. However, the author isn't charging other homeless people who come in less frequently and don't cause a mess. The key here is the difference in behavior between the couple and others. The author is trying to set boundaries to prevent misuse of the establishment's resources.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address specific issues caused by this couple. If the couple is causing a mess and taking things they shouldn't, it's reasonable to want to stop that. Charging for the cups could be a way to do that. However, there's a nuance here. The cups are part of the service, and if the business is providing water as a courtesy, maybe it's within their rights to charge for excessive use. But since these are homeless individuals, there's a social responsibility angle. But the author isn't cutting them off entirely; they're just considering charging. The other coworkers don't mind, so maybe there's inconsistency in how the policy is handled.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to set boundaries to prevent exploitation of the business's resources. The couple's actions are disrespectful and cause extra work. The author isn't denying help entirely but is looking for a way to manage the situation. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
