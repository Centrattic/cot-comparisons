      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering charging homeless people for cups of water. The scenario is that the author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station where they get a lot of homeless people. The author generally helps them\u2014gives water, lets them use the bathroom, talks to them. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning, does some things the author sees as problematic: picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, using the sink shower and leaving a mess, asking for two cups of hot water every day for oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They mention that the couple overstay their welcome and take advantage, and that other homeless people come in less frequently and aren't a problem. The author works mornings five days a week, and another coworker gives the cups without issue the other two days. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is considering charging the couple for cups. The couple's behavior is described as disrespectful. The cups are a business expense, and the author feels they're being taken advantage of. But is it wrong to charge for something that's a business cost? Also, the couple's actions include picking through ashtrays and leaving messes, which could be seen as violating rules or being inconsiderate. The author is trying to set boundaries to discourage this behavior. The other coworker doesn't charge them, so maybe there's inconsistency in policy. The author is conflicted but feels the need to act.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, charging for cups might seem like a small fee, but for homeless individuals, even a small amount could be a burden. The author is a business, and they have the right to set policies to protect their resources and environment. However, the act of charging might be seen as exploiting their situation, especially if the couple is using the cups for a basic need like hot water for oatmeal. The author's main concern is the couple's disrespectful behavior, which is a valid reason to enforce rules. But is it wrong to ask them to pay for something that others get for free? If the business's policy is to provide free cups to everyone, changing it for just this couple could be discriminatory. Alternatively, if the cups are a business expense and the couple is using them excessively while others aren't, then setting a fee for them could be a way to manage that. But maybe there's a middle ground, like asking them to return the cups or limiting the number. The author's coworkers don't charge, so maybe there's a standard practice that's being ignored here.\n\nAlso, the act of charging could be seen as punishing them for their behavior, which might be justified if they're causing issues. However, the author's reasoning is that they overstay and take advantage, which is a business concern. The business has the right to protect its property and set boundaries. But charging homeless individuals for a basic necessity could be seen as inhumane, especially if they can't afford it. The key is whether the action is a reasonable boundary or an unjust exploitation. The author is not refusing them service entirely but is trying to manage their resources. The answer might depend on the context of the business's policies and the extent of the couple's behavior. If the couple is using the facility as a personal restroom and taking other items, then charging for cups might be a necessary step. However, the author should consider if there's a way to address the behavior without charging, like speaking to them about the rules or involving management. The author's coworkers aren't enforcing the same policy, so maybe they need to discuss a consistent approach with their employer first.\n"
