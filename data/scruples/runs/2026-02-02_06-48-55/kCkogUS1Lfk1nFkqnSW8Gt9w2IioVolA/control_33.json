Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario involves a bar/restaurant employee who gives out water, restroom access, etc., but is frustrated with a specific homeless couple who misuse the resources.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a position where they provide services to homeless individuals, which is generally seen as compassionate. However, the specific couple in question is causing problems by picking through ashtrays, misusing the bathroom, and taking multiple cups of hot water. The author wants to start charging for the cups to discourage their behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge them. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, providing free resources to homeless people is a form of charity. Charging them might be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation. But on the other hand, the couple's actions are disruptive and disrespectful. The author isn't charging others, but only this couple. The cups are compostable and more expensive, which adds to the business's costs. The author is trying to set boundaries to prevent abuse of their hospitality.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects. Compassion vs. business sustainability. If the couple is indeed causing issues, it's reasonable for the author to want to address the problem. Charging for the cups could be a way to deter the behavior without outright refusing help. However, there's a risk of appearing judgmental or discriminatory. The other employees are giving the cups for free, so maybe the author should discuss with the team first before implementing a policy.\n\nBut the author is not asking to deny service entirely, just to start charging. The couple's actions are affecting the business's operations (mess, misuse), so it's not just about the cups. The author's intention is to discourage disrespect. In this context, wanting to charge might be a reasonable boundary. However, it's important to consider if there's a better way to address the issue without charging, like politely asking them not to misuse the facilities or enforcing rules for all customers.\n\nBut the author is in a difficult position. They're trying to balance kindness with the need to maintain their business's standards. It's possible that they're not in the wrong because they're setting limits on behavior that's affecting the business. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the charging is seen as targeting the homeless specifically, that could be problematic. But since the couple's behavior is the issue, it's more about addressing their misuse rather than their homeless status. Therefore, the author is justified in wanting to charge to discourage the specific problematic behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
