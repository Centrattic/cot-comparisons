The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless people. They\u2019re okay with giving water, using the restroom, etc., but there's a specific couple they find problematic. The couple picks through ashtrays, uses the bathroom improperly, leaves a mess, and takes two cups of hot water every morning. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage and being disrespectful, especially since others don't have the same issues. The coworker on the other days gives the cups without charging, so the author is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Charging homeless people for basic necessities like water could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable position. The couple in question is already in a disadvantaged situation, and adding a cost for something as simple as water might be unfair. The author's intention is to discourage the couple's behavior, but is this a valid reason to charge them? The couple's actions (picking through ashtrays, sink-showering, leaving messes) are indeed disrespectful and might be grounds for limiting their access, but charging for water complicates things.\n\nThe author mentions they\u2019re not the one purchasing the cups, but they\u2019re aware the cups are more expensive. This might be a way to cut costs or manage resources, but it's not clear if the bar/restaurant has a policy in place. The coworker doesn't charge them, so there's inconsistency in how the policy is applied. The author is considering charging them to discourage the behavior, but this could be seen as targeting a specific individual based on their personal feelings rather than enforcing a fair policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple's behavior is problematic. They\u2019re using the facilities improperly, which costs the business in terms of maintenance and supplies. The author might feel that charging them is a way to enforce better behavior or limit their access without being outright rude. However, water is a basic necessity, and charging for it could prevent someone from accessing clean water, which is a fundamental human right. Even if the couple's actions are disrespectful, charging them for water might be an excessive response.\n\nThe author's main issue is the couple's disrespect and overuse. Maybe there are other ways to address this without charging for water. For example, setting a policy that only a certain number of cups are given out, or politely asking them to clean up after themselves. Charging for something as essential as water could be seen as taking advantage of their homelessness. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect their business's resources, but the method of charging for water is questionable.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about the couple's behavior, the solution of charging them for water might be inappropriate. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they're denying access to a basic necessity based on the couple's actions. The right approach might be to address the specific behaviors without imposing a financial burden. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a middle ground where the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the act of charging for water seems excessive and discriminatory, especially given the couple's vulnerability.\n"
