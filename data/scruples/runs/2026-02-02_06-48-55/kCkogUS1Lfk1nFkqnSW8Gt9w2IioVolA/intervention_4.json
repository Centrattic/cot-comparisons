The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is working at a bar/restaurant next to a train station. They get a lot of homeless people, and they\u2019re generally okay with giving water, letting them use the restroom, etc. But there's this one couple that comes in every morning, does some questionable things like picking through ashtrays, using the sink to shower and leave a mess, and asks for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel like the couple is taking advantage and overstepping, but they\u2019re unsure if they\u2019re in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are. I need to decide A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the actions of the couple. Picking through ashtrays for cigarettes is definitely not appropriate. Using the sink as a shower and leaving a mess is also disrespectful. They\u2019re asking for cups every day, which might add up. The author is concerned about their behavior and wants to set boundaries. Charging for cups seems like a way to discourage this behavior and perhaps generate some revenue, since the cups are costly.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple is homeless, so asking for a free cup of water might be a basic need. However, the couple's actions go beyond just needing water. They\u2019re misusing the resources (ashtrays, bathroom), which could justify the author wanting to set some limits. The author is not asking them to leave, just to charge for the cups, which are a business expense.\n\nBut is it fair to charge someone for something that's a basic necessity? However, the author is already providing some services for free, but the couple is overstepping by their actions. The author might be trying to enforce some rules without being hostile. Charging for cups could be a way to deter the couple from continuing their disrespectful behavior, especially since the cups are part of the business's costs.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the couple is being disrespectful, the business isn't obligated to provide services for free. The author is within their rights to ask them to pay for the cups, especially if their actions are causing issues. The key point is that the couple is violating the norms of the establishment, so the author's desire to enforce boundaries is understandable.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They\u2019re trying to manage a situation where a specific group is exploiting the hospitality. Charging for the cups is a reasonable measure, given the couple's behavior. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
