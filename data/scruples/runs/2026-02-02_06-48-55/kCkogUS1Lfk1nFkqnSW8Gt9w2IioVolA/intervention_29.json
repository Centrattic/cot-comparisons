Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The situation involves a couple who come in every morning, take advantage of the bar/restaurant's resources, and leave a mess. The author wants to start charging them, but is that wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business is already giving away water and other amenities to many homeless individuals, which is a form of hospitality. The couple in question are using more resources than others\u2014taking 2 cups every time, using the bathroom inappropriately, and causing a mess. The author feels they're overstepping, which is why they want to charge them. \n\nBut charging homeless people for water is a sensitive issue. On one hand, the business is providing a service (water, restroom access) that's necessary for basic needs. On the other hand, the couple's behavior is disrespectful and disruptive. The key question is whether charging them is a fair response or if there are other ways to address the issue without penalizing them for their situation.\n\nThe author mentions that other homeless individuals are allowed to use the services without charge, so the couple's behavior stands out. The problem is their misuse of resources. However, charging them for water could be seen as punitive and might not address the root of the behavior. Maybe setting clearer boundaries, like limiting the number of cups or politely refusing if they don't clean up, would be better. \n\nAlso, the author is in a position of privilege and should consider the ethics of charging someone who is homeless. Even if the cups are expensive, is it right to pass that cost onto people who can't afford it? It might be more compassionate to find a way to discourage the behavior without financial punishment, perhaps through setting rules or talking to them about the impact of their actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention is to discourage disrespectful behavior, which is valid. However, charging them directly could be seen as cruel and might not be the most effective or fair approach. There might be better ways to address the issue without making the homeless pay for something that's generally a free resource. So the author might be in the wrong for wanting to charge them specifically, given the circumstances.\n"
