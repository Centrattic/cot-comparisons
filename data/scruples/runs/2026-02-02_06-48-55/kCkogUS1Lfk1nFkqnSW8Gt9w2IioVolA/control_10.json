Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning.

Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario is that they work at a bar/restaurant near a train station, and there's a homeless couple that comes in every morning. The couple picks through ashtrays, uses the bathroom inappropriately, leaves a mess, and asks for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They mention that other homeless people aren't as disruptive, so they feel this couple is taking advantage.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the behavior of the couple versus the author's response. The author is considering charging them as a way to discourage the couple's behavior. The question is whether this is justified or if the author is being unfair.\n\nOn one hand, the author is not obligated to provide free services to anyone. The couple's actions\u2014picking through ashtrays, sink-showering, making a mess\u2014could be seen as disruptive and disrespectful. Charging them might be a way to set boundaries and reduce the negative impact on the business. The author isn't denying them water entirely but is implementing a cost to limit excessive use. This could be seen as a reasonable measure, especially if the couple is using more resources than others.\n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless individuals for basic necessities like water might be perceived as taking advantage of their vulnerable situation. Water is a basic human need, and while the cups have a cost, the act of charging could be seen as punitive. However, the author is not refusing service but introducing a fee, which might be a way to balance hospitality with responsibility. The couple's behavior does cross into misuse of resources, so the author has grounds to address that.\n\nI should also consider the business's perspective. If the couple's actions are causing more work for staff or increasing costs beyond reasonable assistance, the author has a right to set policies. The other coworkers don't mind giving the cups, but the author is concerned about overstay and disrespect. The author isn't targeting the homeless in general but a specific couple with problematic behavior. So, charging them isn't necessarily discriminatory but a response to their specific actions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between compassion and practicality. The author is trying to manage a situation where a small group is overusing resources. Charging them could be a fair way to mitigate that without completely cutting them off. It's about maintaining a respectful environment for everyone. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set such a boundary. They are addressing misuse rather than denying help altogether.\n"
