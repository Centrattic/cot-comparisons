Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station and has a couple homeless individuals coming in every morning. They pick through ashtrays, misuse the bathroom, and take two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the couple is taking advantage of the hospitality by overusing resources. They mention that other homeless people come in occasionally and aren't a problem, but this couple's daily presence and messy behavior are causing frustration. The author feels it's disrespectful and wants to set a boundary by charging for the cups.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Charging homeless people for basic necessities like water seems harsh, especially if they can't afford it. Water is a fundamental need, and while the cups might cost the business money, is it fair to deny someone water for that reason? The couple might not have access to clean water otherwise. But on the other hand, the business has the right to manage its resources and prevent misuse. If the couple is misusing facilities and causing extra work (like cleaning up), the business might have valid concerns about encouraging such behavior.\n\nThe author is trying to balance compassion with practicality. They are okay with helping others but feel that this specific couple is crossing a line. The key question is whether charging for cups is a reasonable way to address the issue. Alternative solutions might include setting a limit on the number of cups per person, asking them to clean up after themselves, or talking to them about respectful use of facilities. Charging might be seen as punitive and could prevent the homeless from accessing necessary resources, even if they are misusing some aspects.\n\nHowever, the business isn't obligated to provide services without limits. They can set rules about how their facilities are used. The problem arises when the action taken (charging) is disproportionate to the issue. If the cups are a significant cost, maybe a small fee could deter misuse without being exploitative. But if the homeless can't pay, it's a problem. The author's coworker doesn't charge, so there's inconsistency in the approach.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's intent is to protect the business's resources and prevent misuse, they might not be entirely wrong. However, the method of charging could be seen as unfair, especially if it denies access to something as basic as water. The situation is complex, but the author's perspective is understandable given the couple's behavior. So, while there's a valid ethical dilemma, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, but the approach could use more consideration.\n"
