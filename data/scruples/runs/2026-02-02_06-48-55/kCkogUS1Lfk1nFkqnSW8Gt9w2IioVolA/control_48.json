Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author working at a bar/restaurant near a train station that gets a lot of homeless people. The author generally isn't against giving them water, restroom access, etc., but there's a specific couple they find problematic. The couple comes every morning, picks through ashtrays, uses the bathroom inappropriately, and asks for two hot water cups for oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They mention that other homeless individuals are helped without issue, but this couple's behavior seems disrespectful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge this couple. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business isn't a shelter, so they aren't obligated to provide any services. The couple's actions of picking through ashtrays and using the sink as a shower are clearly against the establishment's rules and could be seen as theft or misuse. The author isn't refusing help entirely but wants to set boundaries, especially since the couple is overstepping. Charging for cups might be a way to deter them from taking advantage, as the cups are costly. \n\nHowever, charging homeless individuals for basic necessities like water can be controversial. Some might argue that the author is penalizing people in need, especially if they can't afford to pay. But the key point here is the couple's disruptive behavior. The author isn't denying water to all homeless people but specifically targeting those who misuse the establishment's resources. \n\nThe author's main issue is the couple's disrespectful behavior, not just their homelessness. Charging them could be a way to enforce rules and discourage continued misuse. On the other hand, if the business is already allowing some leeway by giving out cups, the author might be seen as inconsistent if they start charging selectively. \n\nBut the author is trying to address specific problematic behavior, which is different from general homelessness. The couple's actions are causing a mess and possibly stealing (ashtray picking), which the author is trying to counteract. Charging for the cups could be a reasonable measure to reduce their visits or correct their behavior. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about balancing compassion with the need to maintain order in the business. The author isn't being cruel but is setting boundaries against misuse. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing specific issues rather than punishing homelessness in general. However, I need to make sure there's no implicit bias or judgment here. The author is focusing on the couple's actions, not their status as homeless. Therefore, charging for cups in this context is a response to behavior, not a blanket policy against the homeless.\n"
