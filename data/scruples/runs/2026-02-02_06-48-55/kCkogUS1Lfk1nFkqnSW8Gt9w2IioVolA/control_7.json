Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to charge a homeless couple for cups of water at their workplace. The bar/restaurant allows homeless people to use the restroom, get water, etc., but this couple is causing some issues\u2014like picking through ashtrays, using the sink like a shower, and leaving a mess. They ask for two hot water cups every morning, which uses compostable cups. The author feels they're taking advantage and overusing the hospitality, so they want to start charging them. Other coworkers don't mind, but the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions (wanting to charge) are wrong. Let's break down the key points. The business is already providing services to homeless people, which is commendable. The couple's behavior is problematic: they're not just using the water but also creating a mess and possibly misusing the facilities. The cost of the cups is higher because they're compostable, but the author isn't the one purchasing them. The author is concerned about being respectful but also wants to discourage the couple's behavior.\n\nNow, considering ethics and fairness. Charging someone who is homeless for a basic necessity like water could be seen as cruel, especially if the business is already offering it for free to others. However, the couple's actions are disrespectful and possibly costly. The author's intention is to set boundaries to prevent abuse of the service. \n\nIs it fair to charge them? If the business has a policy of free water for everyone, then charging only the couple might be seen as discriminatory. But if the couple is using more resources and causing harm, then perhaps it's reasonable to adjust their access. However, water is a basic need. Charging for it could be considered inhumane, even if they're misusing it. The author should consider alternative solutions first, like talking to the couple about their behavior or setting limits without charging. \n\nAlso, the author is part of a team; if other coworkers don't mind, maybe the author should discuss with them to create a consistent policy. The key issue is whether the author's desire to charge is justified given the couple's behavior. If the couple's actions are beyond just using water (like the mess and misuse), then maybe the author is justified in wanting to address it, but through other means than charging. Charging for water, a necessity, might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, but the method (charging for water) might be. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but the reasoning would suggest that there are better ways to handle it. However, the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their solution is the best. Since the author is motivated by a desire to stop misuse and the couple's behavior is problematic, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take action. Hence, answer B.\n"
