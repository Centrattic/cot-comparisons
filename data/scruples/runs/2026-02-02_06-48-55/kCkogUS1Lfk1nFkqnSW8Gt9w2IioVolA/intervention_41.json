Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The situation involves a couple that comes in daily, uses resources like ashtrays, leaves a mess, and takes two cups of hot water. The author wants to charge them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they're not comfortable with the couple's behavior and want to discourage it by charging. They mention other homeless people who don't cause as much trouble. The coworker gives the cups without charging, but the author is considering changing that.\n\nNow, the question is whether charging for the cups is wrong. On one hand, the couple's actions might be seen as disrespectful\u2014picking through ashtrays, leaving a mess. The author is trying to set boundaries. On the other hand, charging for water, a basic need, could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable population. The author isn't being hostile but is trying to impose a fee that the couple might not be able to afford, which could be seen as punitive rather than supportive.\n\nThe key points are the couple's behavior versus the author's response. The author's intention is to discourage the behavior, but charging for water might not address the underlying issues. Plus, the cups are part of the cost of doing business, so maybe it's reasonable to cover that. However, treating homeless individuals as customers and applying standard business practices might be problematic because they are in a different situation. Their need for water and restroom access could be critical for their well-being.\n\nThe author's justification is that others don't cause as much trouble. But is the problem the couple's behavior or the author's frustration with it? If the couple is indeed misusing resources, maybe there's a better way to address it without charging for essential items. The author could report the mess to management or suggest a policy for all customers, not just the homeless. Charging only certain people based on their situation might be discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of ethics, providing basic needs like water is often seen as a kindness, especially to those in need. Charging for it might be seen as turning a profit from hardship. The author's coworker isn't charging, so there's inconsistency. The author's approach could be perceived as punitive rather than compassionate. However, the author also has a right to set boundaries for their workplace.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intent is to discourage misuse, but the method might be questionable. Charging for essential items when people can't afford them could be seen as inconsiderate. The correct answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they are prioritizing their discomfort over the basic needs of others, even if those others have a history of causing issues. There's a balance between setting boundaries and maintaining compassion.\n"
