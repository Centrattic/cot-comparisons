Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple of homeless individuals who come into the bar/restaurant every morning, use the ashtrays, leave a mess in the bathroom, and take two cups of hot water for their oatmeal. The author wants to charge them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. The author is conflicted because they don't mind helping homeless people but find the couple's behavior disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is providing a service, and the couple is using resources (water cups) without contributing. The cups are a cost, and the author might feel that the couple is taking advantage. On the other hand, the couple is homeless and might not have the means to pay for even a small item like cups. Charging them could be seen as exploiting their situation or adding a financial burden when they can't afford it.\n\nThe author mentions that other homeless individuals come in occasionally and don't cause a mess, so the issue is specifically with this couple's behavior. The author wants to discourage such behavior, which is understandable. But is charging a fee the right approach? Maybe there are other ways to address the mess without charging for cups, like politely asking them to clean up or setting boundaries about bathroom use.\n\nAnother angle is the cost of the cups. The author isn't purchasing them, but the business does. If the couple is using two cups every day, over time that adds up. However, is it fair to charge someone who can't afford to pay? It might come across as being stingy or not empathetic. The author's coworkers don't charge them, so the author is trying to change the policy, which could create inconsistency in how the business interacts with homeless people.\n\nI should also think about the principle of treating all customers equally. If the author starts charging the couple, it might set a precedent where other homeless individuals are also charged, which could be seen as unfair. Alternatively, if the business's policy is to provide free cups, then the author is going against that policy, which might not be their place to change unilaterally.\n\nThe key points are: the couple's behavior is disrespectful (messing up the bathrooms, taking extra cups), the author wants to deter this, but imposing a charge might not be the best solution. Maybe the author should address the behavior directly instead of charging. However, the author is feeling justified in wanting to protect the business's resources.\n\nIn terms of ethics, helping the homeless is a moral choice, but businesses aren't obligated to provide services for free. However, charging someone who can't afford it could be seen as cruel. The author might be in the right in wanting to protect the business's resources but in the wrong if the charge is an unnecessary added burden on the homeless.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right to want to set boundaries but in the wrong to impose a financial charge that could be seen as punitive. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because charging the couple isn't the appropriate way to address the issue. Instead, they should find another solution that doesn't harm the individuals' access to basic necessities.\n"
