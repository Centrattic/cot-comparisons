      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge the homeless couple for cups of water. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station. They have a lot of homeless people coming in. The author is okay with giving out water, letting them use the restroom, and chatting. But there's this couple that comes every morning. They do things like pick through ashtrays for cigarettes, use the bathroom in a way that leaves a mess, and ask for two cups of hot water each morning for oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they are compostable and more expensive. The author feels the couple is taking advantage and overstepping, and they want to discourage their behavior. They mention other homeless people come in a few times a week and that's fine, but this couple's actions are disrespectful.\n\nThe author is feeling conflicted because they've been giving the cups for free so far but want to change that. The coworker on other days just gives them the cups without charging. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by wanting to charge them.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, charging someone in need might seem harsh. But the author is also concerned about the couple's behavior\u2014messing up the bathrooms, picking through ashtrays, and using up resources. The cups are a cost to the business, which might be a valid concern. However, is it right to charge people who are homeless for basic necessities like water? The author is not charging others, just this couple, which might be seen as discriminatory. They are singling out this couple based on their behavior, which could be justified if the behavior is indeed problematic. The author is trying to maintain the business's standards and prevent misuse of free resources. On the other hand, withholding water, even if charged, might be seen as inhumane, especially for people in need. It's a balance between kindness and setting boundaries. The author's intention is to discourage disrespectful behavior, which is understandable, but the method (charging) might not be the best approach. Maybe there are other ways to address the mess and resource misuse without charging for water. So, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the couple is indeed causing issues, the author has a right to set boundaries. However, charging for water could be seen as punishing them for their behavior. Alternatively, the business could enforce rules about bathroom use or prohibit picking through ashtrays, and if they continue, maybe ask them to leave. Charging might not be the most ethical solution, but the author's intent is to address misuse, so maybe they are not entirely in the wrong. It's a gray area, but I think the author's position is more about protecting the business's resources and maintaining standards rather than being mean. So, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
