Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station and encounters homeless individuals regularly. They generally don't mind helping them with water, restroom access, etc. However, there's a specific couple that comes in every morning, does things like picking through ashtrays, using the bathroom improperly, and asking for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage and being disrespectful.\n\nFirst, the author is considering charging the homeless individuals for something they usually provide for free. The cups are a cost to the business, but is it ethical to charge those who can't afford it? Charging might be seen as taking advantage of their vulnerable situation. The couple's behavior is also mentioned as a problem\u2014leaving messes, which could justify some kind of policy change. But the author's main issue is charging them for the cups, which is a small item that might be necessary for the couple's basic needs.\n\nThe business isn't a shelter, so they aren't obligated to provide these services. However, they've been doing it out of goodwill. The author is questioning if they're being an asshole by wanting to stop this. The key here is whether it's wrong to impose a cost on homeless individuals for something they've been getting for free. Charging could be seen as a way to enforce a policy against certain behaviors, but it also affects their access to basic necessities. There's a balance between maintaining hospitality and setting boundaries. \n\nThe author hasn't confronted the couple about their behavior directly, like the mess in the bathroom. Instead, they're focusing on the cups. Maybe addressing the mess first would be a better approach. Charging for cups might be a form of punishment for their behavior, but it's not directly addressing the issue. Also, the coworker gives them the cups without a problem, which adds inconsistency. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. The author isn't forced to provide the cups, but by charging, they're making a small financial barrier for someone who's homeless. It could be argued that the author is within their right to set such a policy since it's their business, but others might see it as inhumane. The author's frustration is valid if the couple is being disrespectful, but the method of addressing it might be questionable. \n\nOverall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to decide the terms of service for their establishment. However, the action might be seen as harsh given the context of the homeless individuals' situation. It's more about the approach and whether there's a better way to handle the behaviors without charging them for the cups.\n"
