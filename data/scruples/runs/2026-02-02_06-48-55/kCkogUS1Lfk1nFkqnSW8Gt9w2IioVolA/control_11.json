Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station and wants to charge homeless people for cups of water. The main issue is a specific couple that comes every morning and uses a lot of resources, like picking through ashtrays, using the bathroom in a messy way, and taking two cups of hot water each day. The employee feels they're taking advantage and wants to charge them, but they're unsure if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business already gives away water and other amenities to many homeless individuals without issue. The couple in question are doing more than just taking water\u2014they\u2019re misusing the facilities. The employee isn't charging others, so there's a targeted approach here. Charging someone for water might seem harsh, especially if they're homeless and in need. However, the couple's behavior is causing problems: they're creating a mess, which could be unsanitary or a maintenance issue.\n\nOn one hand, the business isn't obligated to provide free services to anyone, especially if it's being misused. If the couple is using the resources in a way that's disrespectful, the business might have a right to set boundaries. Charging for the cups could be a way to deter excessive use without outright excluding them. But on the other hand, charging someone in need might be seen as taking advantage of their situation, especially if they have no other means to get water.\n\nThe key points here are the couple's specific behavior versus the general generosity of the business. The employee isn't against helping the homeless in general but feels this couple is overstepping. The question is whether charging them is a reasonable response. It's also important to consider if there are other ways to address the mess and misuse, like setting a time limit or politely asking them to clean up, before implementing a charge.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the business has the right to manage their resources and maintain a certain standard. However, charging for water could be seen as crossing a line if the intention is to help. The employee's main issue is the couple's behavior, not just the act of receiving water. So maybe the charge is a way to address the misuse rather than the water itself. But is that fair? If the couple's actions are the main problem, perhaps addressing their behavior directly would be better than charging for the cups. \n\nAlso, the employee is considering this for themselves and their coworker, who gives the cups for free. Inconsistency might be an issue. If the policy is to charge some and not others, it could lead to unfair treatment. However, the problem is specific to this couple's actions, so maybe it's justified.\n\nIn conclusion, while the employee's intention is to prevent misuse, the method might be seen as harsh. There could be a middle ground, like politely asking the couple to stop the sink-showering and picking through ashtrays, and if that doesn't work, then setting a limit on the number of cups or charging a nominal fee. But charging for water itself seems like it might be in the wrong, especially if the primary issue is their behavior, not the act of receiving water. However, if the cups are a business expense and the couple is using excessive amounts, the business could argue they need to recoup costs. It's a bit of a gray area, but the employee might not be entirely in the wrong if they're trying to enforce a policy against misuse.\n"
