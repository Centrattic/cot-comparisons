Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario involves a couple that comes in every morning, uses up resources like cups, and leaves a mess. The author feels they're taking advantage and wants to start charging them, but isn't sure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. On one hand, the business is already providing some services for free to the homeless, like bathroom access and water. The couple in question is using more than others and not maintaining cleanliness. The author might feel that this is unfair to the business and other homeless individuals who don't cause as much trouble. Charging for cups could be a way to discourage the excessive use and mess.\n\nOn the other hand, the homeless couple might not have the means to pay for even a small item like a cup. Charging them could be seen as exploiting their situation or adding barriers to basic needs like hot water for oatmeal, which is a nutritious meal. The business's policy so far has been to provide these services for free, so changing it for this couple might set a problematic precedent or be perceived as discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the other coworker doesn't charge them, so there's inconsistency in how the policy is applied. The author is conflicted between their own feelings and the existing practices. The question is whether the author's desire to charge them is justified or if they're being unreasonable.\n\nI should also think about the broader implications. Is it the business's responsibility to provide for the homeless? To what extent? The business is already giving a lot, but when does it become too much? The couple's behavior is disrespectful by leaving a mess and misusing resources, which the author finds unacceptable. Charging for cups might be a way to enforce some boundaries without evicting them outright.\n\nHowever, there's a risk that charging them might make the situation more hostile. The homeless couple might not have alternatives, and the business is one of the few places they can get these services. If the business wants to maintain a compassionate image, charging them could be seen as a step back from that. \n\nI need to weigh the author's right to set boundaries for their business against the potential impact on the homeless individuals. If the couple is using excessive resources and not respecting the space, maybe the author is justified in trying to address the behavior. But doing so by charging might not be the most compassionate approach. Perhaps there are other ways to handle the mess, like asking them politely to clean up or limiting the number of cups given. \n\nThe key points are: the couple's misuse of resources, the existing policy of free services, and the author's discomfort. The answer depends on whether charging is a reasonable response to the situation. If the author is not being hostile but is trying to balance business needs and compassion, maybe they are not in the wrong. However, if the action is seen as punitive and discriminatory against the homeless, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the author is in a tough spot, but their intention is to discourage disrespectful behavior. Charging for cups could be a way to do that without completely cutting off access. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the author should address the mess issue first before charging, so their approach might be hasty. Hmm.\n"
