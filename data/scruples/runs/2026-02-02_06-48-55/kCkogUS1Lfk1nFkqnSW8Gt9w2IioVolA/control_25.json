Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario is that they work at a bar/restaurant near a train station and get a lot of homeless people. They're okay with giving water, restroom access, etc., but there's a couple that comes every morning, messes up the place, takes two cups of hot water daily, and they want to start charging them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business is providing services that aren't typically free to the public. They are a business, so they have expenses like compostable cups. The couple's behavior is described as taking advantage: picking through ashtrays, using the shower sink (which might not be a proper shower), leaving a mess, and getting two cups daily. The author feels they overstay their welcome and are disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are: Is it reasonable to charge for something that's not typically provided for free? The cups are compostable and more expensive. The business is likely purchasing these cups, so there's a cost involved. The couple's actions are disruptive or disrespectful, which might justify setting boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless individuals for basic needs like water could be seen as harsh. However, the business isn't refusing service; they are asking for payment for a specific item. The author isn't denying their right to access water but wants to charge for the cups, which might be a way to discourage misuse. \n\nThe other coworker gives the cups without issue, leading to inconsistency. The author wants to set a policy to prevent abuse. The question is whether this is fair. If the business allows free access to water for others but wants to charge these specific individuals due to their behavior, it might be a reasonable business decision, not inconsiderate. The author is not being cruel but setting boundaries to prevent exploitation. \n\nHowever, there's an ethical angle. Charging the couple could be seen as punitive. But given their disruptive behavior, it's about managing resources responsibly. The author isn't turning them away but is asking for payment for a cost they incur. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B).\n"
