      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person works at a bar/restaurant next to a train station with a lot of homeless people. They generally don't mind giving them water, using the restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes every morning. This couple is described as picking through ashtrays, using the shower in the sink, leaving a mess, and asking for two cups of hot water daily. The author feels they're taking advantage and wants to charge them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They mention that on other days, a coworker gives the cups for free, and they're conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the behavior of the couple versus the author's response. The author is not angry about giving water itself but about the couple's disrespectful actions. The cups being compostable and costly is a factor, but the main issue is the couple's behavior that's causing a mess and possibly wasting resources. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce some boundaries because the couple is overstepping. On the other hand, charging them might not be the best approach, especially if they can't afford to pay. However, the author isn't denying them the water entirely but wants to set a policy to discourage misuse. \n\nBut wait, if the other coworkers are not charging them, there's inconsistency. The author might be trying to address a specific problem case. The question is whether charging is a reasonable response. Charging might be a way to manage the situation without being hostile, but it's also about fairness. The author isn't asking to exclude them but to adjust the policy for those who misuse the resources. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should talk to the couple about the mess or set a policy for everyone, rather than charging selectively. But the problem is that the couple is different from others who don't cause the same issues. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this specific behavior. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is reacting to specific disrespectful behavior and trying to manage resources responsibly. However, the method of charging might be better discussed with management or applying a consistent policy. But in terms of moral wrongdoing, the author's intentions are to set boundaries, not to harm or exclude the homeless.\n"
