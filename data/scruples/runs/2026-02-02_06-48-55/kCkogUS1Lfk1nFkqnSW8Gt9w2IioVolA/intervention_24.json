      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The scenario describes a bar/restaurant employee who's dealing with a homeless couple that comes in every morning. The couple picks through ashtrays, uses the bathroom inappropriately, leaves a mess, and takes two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They mention that others in the workplace might not have the same issue, and they're conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The key points here are the couple's behavior versus the author's actions. The couple is clearly misusing the facilities\u2014picking through ashtrays (which is unsanitary and possibly stealing), using the shower improperly, and leaving messes. These actions are disrespectful and could be seen as taking advantage of the hospitality offered by the business.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering charging for the cups of water. Charging for a basic necessity like water might seem harsh, especially when the couple is homeless and likely in need. However, the cups themselves are a product that the business purchases, and if the couple is using them excessively or misusing them, it's reasonable for the business to set some boundaries. The fact that the couple is taking two cups every morning and the cups are expensive could justify a fee to prevent waste or misuse.\n\nBut wait, water itself isn't being charged, just the cups. The author isn't asking for money for the water, which is a basic need. They are focusing on the cups, which are a disposable product. The question is whether this is a fair policy. The business isn't obligated to provide free cups to anyone, especially if it's being abused. The couple's behavior is problematic, so implementing a charge might be a way to discourage their continued misuse of the facilities.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the business. If the couple is causing a mess and wasting resources (cups, water, cleaning time), then it's reasonable to set some kind of limit or fee. The author mentions that other homeless individuals come in occasionally and aren't an issue, but this couple is a daily problem. Charging them might not be the most compassionate approach, but it's a practical solution to an ongoing issue.\n\nHowever, there's also a moral aspect. The couple is homeless and might not have many resources. Charging them for cups of water could be seen as adding insult to injury. The business is providing a service (restroom access, water), which is a form of social support. The author's colleague doesn't charge them, so there's inconsistency in the policy. The author might be enforcing a rule to protect the business's resources, but it's important to consider the broader implications of turning away someone in need, even if their behavior is problematic.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the business has the right to set its own policies. If the couple is misusing the services, it's reasonable to adjust how those services are provided. Charging for the cups could be a way to balance the need to assist the homeless while preventing abuse. The key is whether the charge is reasonable and proportionate. Since the cups are compostable and more expensive, the cost might be justified to cover the business's expenses.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the author is not the owner, so they might not have the authority to implement such a policy without discussion. They mention that their coworker doesn't charge the couple, so there's a discrepancy. The author should probably discuss this with their manager to find a consistent policy rather than acting unilaterally. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge them, not whether they should act without permission.\n\nIn conclusion, while the couple's behavior is unacceptable, the author's intention to charge for the cups is a way to address the misuse. The charge isn't for the water itself but for the cups used to carry it. Given the couple's repeated misuse, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to mitigate a problem caused by the couple's actions. However, the approach should be compassionate and consistent with the business's policies. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
