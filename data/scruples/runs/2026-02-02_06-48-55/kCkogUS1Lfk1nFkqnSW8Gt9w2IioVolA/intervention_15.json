The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and deals with a lot of homeless people. They\u2019re okay with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, etc., but there's a couple that comes every morning. This couple does things like picking through ashtrays for cigarettes, using the sink as a shower, and leaving a mess. They ask for two cups of hot water daily for oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups because they feel the couple is overstepping and being disrespectful. The cups are compostable and more expensive, but the author isn\u2019t the one buying them. They\u2019re conflicted because they help other homeless people without charging, but this couple's behavior is bothering them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether charging for water is a reasonable step. The couple is using resources (cups) that cost money, and their behavior (messing up the bathrooms, taking cigarettes) adds to the problem. The author might feel that this specific couple is exploiting the hospitality more than others. However, the couple is homeless, so charging them could be seen as punitive and potentially inhumane, especially if they\u2019re using the water for basic needs like oatmeal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the owner, so maybe they should discuss this with management first. The other staff member doesn't charge them, which might indicate inconsistency in policy. The author might be overstepping by making a policy on their own. Also, the couple\u2019s actions (sinking the bathroom, taking cigarettes) are disrespectful, which the author is probably trying to address. However, charging for water, especially for something as basic as oatmeal, could be seen as taking it too far, even if the cups are costly.\n\nThe key points here are the couple's behavior versus the author's right to set boundaries. While the author has valid concerns about the couple's actions, the method of addressing it by charging for water might not be the best approach. It could be seen as a way to discriminate against them when others are allowed to use the same resources without cost. The author might need to address the mess and misuse of the bathrooms first, perhaps by talking to the couple or involving management, rather than charging for the cups. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for wanting to impose a charge for something that other homeless individuals aren't being charged for, especially if it's a basic necessity.\n"
