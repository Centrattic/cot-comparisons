Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable to charge homeless people for cups of water, given the specific behaviors of this couple. The author works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and generally helps the homeless by giving them water, bathroom access, etc. But there's a particular couple that comes every morning, does things like picking through ashtrays, leaving messes, and asking for two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. On one hand, the author's business is providing services, and there's a cost involved with the compostable cups. If the couple is using these cups regularly and leaving a mess, maybe the author feels they should contribute to the cost. But on the other hand, charging homeless individuals for basic necessities like water could be seen as taking advantage of their vulnerable situation. \n\nThe couple's behavior is described as disrespectful\u2014sinking the shower, leaving messes, picking through ashtrays. The author might feel that this couple is taking more than others and not respecting the space. However, is it fair to penalize them by charging for something that's generally free? The author is conflicted because they help others but want to discourage this couple's behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the policy consistency. The coworker doesn't charge them on other days, so the author might be setting an inconsistent policy. Charging could be seen as a way to enforce rules, but it might also be discriminatory if others aren't charged. Also, the author isn't the one buying the cups, so maybe they feel indirectly responsible for the cost. But is it right to shift that responsibility onto the homeless couple?\n\nEthically, many places provide water as a basic need, and charging for it could be controversial. However, the author's concern about the couple's excessive and disrespectful use is valid. The key is whether charging them is a proportionate response. If the couple is overusing resources and not respecting the establishment, maybe there's a way to address the behavior without charging. For example, limiting the number of cups or asking them to clean up after themselves. Charging might seem harsh if the cups are for something like oatmeal, which could be a necessity for them, even if the method of obtaining it is problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is willing to help others but wants to single out this couple by charging them, that could be seen as unfair or discriminatory. However, if the couple's behavior is indeed disruptive and others aren't doing the same, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. But since the cups are for something they might need (hot water for oatmeal), charging could be seen as denying a basic need. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for considering charging, as it could be perceived as exploiting their situation rather than addressing their behavior through other means.\n"
