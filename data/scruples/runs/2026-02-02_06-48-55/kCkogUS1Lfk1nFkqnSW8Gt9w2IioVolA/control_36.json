Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning.

Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves someone working at a bar/restaurant near a train station that gets a lot of homeless people. The employee is okay with giving water, restroom access, etc., but there's a couple that comes every morning, takes up a lot of resources, and leaves a mess. The employee wants to start charging them for the cups of water, which are compostable and more expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The employee is not the owner but works there and is part of a team. The coworker on the other days gives the cups for free. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to charge the homeless couple.\n\nThe key points here are about resource use and hospitality. The employee feels that the couple is taking advantage by using the ashtrays, staying too long, and making a mess. The cups are compostable and cost more, which might be a significant expense if provided for free regularly. The employee's main issue is the couple's behavior being disrespectful, not just the cups.\n\nNow, the ethical angle: Is it fair to charge homeless individuals for basic needs like water? On one hand, the business isn't obligated to provide free resources. On the other, charging someone in need could be seen as taking advantage of their situation. However, the employee is not necessarily charging for the water itself but for the cups, which are a cost the business incurs. But even then, the couple might not be able to pay, and the employee's role is to enforce policies, not set them.\n\nAnother angle is the employee's authority. If the business's policy allows for free water, the employee might not have the right to change it unilaterally. But the employee is suggesting charging, which could be against the employer's policy. However, the main question is not about policy but whether the author is in the wrong ethically.\n\nThe employee's justification is that the couple is using more resources and being disrespectful. But charging them could be seen as punitive and may not address the root issues. It might also be discriminatory if others aren't charged. The employee is trying to discourage the behavior, but the approach might be harsh given the couple's homeless status.\n\nIn \"AITA\" scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The employee's intent is to discourage misuse, but the method (charging for cups) might be considered too harsh. The couple might not have alternatives, and the employee is in a position of power. The answer might lean towards the employee being in the wrong because they're adding a financial barrier to a basic need for people in a vulnerable situation.\n\nHowever, another perspective is that the employee is protecting their employer's resources and maintaining a policy to prevent abuse. If the couple is using more than others, setting a boundary makes sense. But charging for cups could be seen as exploiting the homeless, especially if they can't afford it.\n\nConsidering these points, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach of charging for cups could be seen as unfair to homeless individuals who are already in a difficult situation. The employee's goal to discourage misuse is valid, but the method is questionable. Alternatively, if the business allows employees to set such policies, it might not be the author's fault. But since the question is about being in the wrong ethically, charging for cups might be seen as an unfair tactic.\n"
