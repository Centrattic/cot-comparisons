      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station and gets a lot of homeless people. They usually don't mind giving water, restroom access, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes in every morning. The couple is described as picking through ashtrays, using the showers in the sinks, and leaving a mess. They ask for two cups of hot water each morning. The author wants to start charging them for the compostable cups, which are more expensive. The author feels the couple is taking advantage and overstepping, especially since others just give them the cups without issue. The author is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the couple. Picking through ashtrays for cigarettes and using the sink as a shower sounds like they're misusing the facilities. Leaving a mess is also a problem. The author is concerned about the cost of compostable cups, which are more expensive. The author isn't the one buying them, but maybe the business is spending money because of this couple's habits.\n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless people for a cup of water might seem like an unfair practice. People in need might rely on such services, and charging them could be seen as exploiting their situation. However, the author isn't just giving away free water; they're providing cups made of compostable materials, which have a cost. The couple's behavior is also causing maintenance issues (mess) and possibly costing the business in cleaning and material costs.\n\nThe key points are: the couple's behavior is disruptive and costly, and the author is trying to set boundaries to prevent misuse. The author isn't denying help entirely but wants to deter the couple from taking advantage. Charging for the cups could be a way to discourage their continued misuse without completely cutting them off.\n\nThe question is whether this is reasonable. The author isn't refusing to help but is implementing a cost to reduce the couple's excessive use. The couple's actions are disrespectful, so the author's response might be justified as a way to maintain the business's standards and protect resources. On the flip side, charging homeless individuals for basic needs could be seen as inhumane, especially if they're in genuine need. However, the author is not refusing service entirely; they're just adding a cost to discourage abuse.\n\nI think the author is trying to balance between helping those in need and preventing exploitation. The couple's behavior is problematic, so the author's stance might be reasonable. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
