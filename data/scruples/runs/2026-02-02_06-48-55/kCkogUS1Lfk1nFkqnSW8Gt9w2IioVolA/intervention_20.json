Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to charge homeless people for cups of water. The person works at a bar/restaurant near a train station that gets a lot of homeless visitors. They\u2019re generally okay with giving out water and other small things, but there's a specific couple that's causing issues. The couple is described as picking through ashtrays, messing up the bathrooms, and taking two cups of hot water daily. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. The coworker on the other days gives the cups for free, but the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Charging people for water is a sensitive issue, especially for those in need. However, the couple's behavior is problematic. They're not just taking water but also creating a mess and possibly stealing cigarettes. The author feels they overstay their welcome and take advantage. The key points here are the actions of the couple versus the author's intent to charge them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, charging for water could be seen as denying a basic necessity, but the couple isn't just asking for water\u2014they're causing damage and taking more than others. The author is trying to set boundaries to discourage disrespectful behavior. On the other hand, the author might be inconsistent since others in the workplace are giving it for free. But the author's main concern is the couple's behavior, not the act of giving water itself. \n\nSo, considering the couple's actions and the author's desire to maintain order and prevent abuse of the hospitality, the author might be justified in setting a boundary. However, the method of charging could be seen as harsh, especially if there's no alternative available. But the author is not refusing the water entirely\u2014just charging, which might be a middle ground. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to address disrespectful behavior while still offering the service for a fee, maintaining a balance between kindness and setting limits.\n"
