Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is working at a bar/restaurant near a train station and dealing with a lot of homeless people. They generally don't mind helping out\u2014giving water, letting them use the restroom, etc. But there's a specific couple that comes in every morning, does some messy stuff like picking through ashtrays and using the sink as a shower. They also take two cups of hot water daily for their oatmeal. The author wants to start charging them for the cups, which are compostable and more expensive. They feel the couple is taking advantage and being disrespectful, and they're conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the business isn't obligated to provide free resources. The couple's behavior (messing with ashtrays, using sink as a shower) is clearly disruptive and disrespectful. Charging for cups might be a way to set boundaries and discourage such behavior. The author's coworker just gives them the cups, but the author feels it's time to change that.\n\nOn the other hand, charging homeless people for water might seem harsh, especially if the couple is in need. However, the couple isn't just asking for water; they're taking extra cups and being messy. The author isn't refusing them entirely but wants to implement a charge as a deterrent. It's about balancing kindness with setting limits to prevent abuse of resources.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for wanting to charge. The couple's actions are problematic, and the author is trying to address the misuse without completely cutting off help. Charging might be a middle ground. So, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong) because they're setting boundaries against disrespectful behavior, not denying help entirely. The main issue is the couple's actions, not the author's intent to charge as a way to manage that.\n"
