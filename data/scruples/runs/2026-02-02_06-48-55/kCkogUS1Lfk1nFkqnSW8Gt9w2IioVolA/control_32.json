Mostly, it doesn't bother me. I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to charge homeless people for water is in the wrong. The situation is that a couple comes in daily, does some messy things, and takes two cups of hot water. The author feels they're taking advantage and wants to charge them, but others at work don't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Charging homeless individuals for basic necessities like water is a sensitive issue. On one hand, the business isn't obligated to provide free services, especially if some people are misusing the resources. On the other hand, charging for something as essential as water could be seen as exploiting their vulnerable situation. \n\nThe couple's behavior includes picking through ashtrays and leaving a mess, which might justify some form of policy change. However, the author is considering charging them specifically, not implementing a general policy. That could come across as discriminatory if only certain homeless individuals are charged. Also, the fact that other coworkers don't charge might create an inconsistency. \n\nThe cups are compostable and more expensive, so there's a cost involved. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach could be seen as punitive rather than addressing the root issue. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting a policy for all customers, not singling out the couple. \n\nThe key points are: the act of charging homeless people for basic needs, potential discrimination, and the business's right to set policies versus the ethical responsibility to help those in need. The author's intention is to discourage disrespect, but the method might be harsh. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is valid, charging homeless people for water could be seen as wrong because it targets a vulnerable group. The answer might be A, but I need to check if the couple's misuse justifies it. However, the method of response (charging) might not be fair, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
