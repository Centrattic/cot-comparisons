      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is that he went to the men's room first, found no changing station, asked a worker but was told to go elsewhere, couldn't wait, so he went to the women's restroom and got escorted out. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and policies regarding this. In many places, laws allow parents of either gender to use opposite-gender facilities to change diapers, especially if they're with infants. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) might require accessible changing tables, but that's more for people with disabilities. However, some states have specific laws allowing parents to use the opposite gender restroom for diaper changes when necessary.\n\nThen there's the store's policy. The store worker didn't direct him to another location, so maybe they didn't have other options. If the store's policy strictly prohibits opposite-gender use, then maybe he violated that. But if the policy is more about safety or privacy, but doesn't account for parents with infants, that could be an issue.\n\nFrom the father's perspective, he had a legitimate need to care for his child. Parents often need to change diapers in public restrooms, and sometimes only one gender's restroom has a changing table. If the men's room doesn't have one, and the alternative isn't feasible, using the women's room might be necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman who saw him freaked out, so there's a privacy concern for other users. The store's response was to remove him, which could be based on their policy, but if that policy is not accommodating for parents, it might be problematic. However, the store's policy is their own, and if they have a rule, even if it's not legally enforceable, they can enforce it.\n\nLegally, in some states, it's allowed. For example, in California, parents can use any restroom if they're caring for a child. Other states might have different laws. If the location is in a state where this is permitted, then the father isn't in the wrong. If not, then maybe he is.\n\nThe article mentions that the store didn't ban him but said it was store policy. So, the store's policy might be conflicting with local laws. If the law allows it, the store's policy might be discriminatory. But if the law doesn't, then he might have violated their policy.\n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole. The answer depends on legal and policy considerations. If the law allows it, then the store's policy is wrong, and he's not the asshole. If the law doesn't, then maybe he is. However, given the common understanding that parents need to care for infants, some might argue that the store should be more accommodating. \n\nBut the answer likely hinges on specific legal statutes. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and assuming that in many places, using the opposite-gender restroom for diaper changes is allowed, the answer might be B (No). However, if the store's policy is strict and the location is in a state where it's not allowed, then maybe A (Yes). But given the typical context of such situations, the answer is often that the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
