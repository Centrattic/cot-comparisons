They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker and was told to try another store. He couldn't wait, so he went to the women's restroom. A woman came in, got upset, called the manager, and he was escorted out. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of the store. Many public places have men's restrooms with diaper-changing stations. If the men's room didn't have one, that's a problem. But maybe the store's policy strictly prohibits men from using women's restrooms, even for diaper changes. In some places, stores might have policies against this regardless of the reason. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, Title IX and other laws typically prohibit gender-based discrimination, but they also protect against harassment. Using the women's restroom as a man could be seen as violating their policy, even if the intent is good. However, some states might have laws allowing men to use restrooms opposite their gender for diaper changes. For example, some states have specific exceptions for diaper-changing. \n\nThe store's policy is key here. If their policy doesn't allow men to use women's restrooms regardless of the reason, then the father might be violating that. But if the store is required to provide an accessible diaper-changing area and they didn't, that's on the store. However, the father's action might still be against their policy even if they were in the wrong for not having facilities.\n\nPublic perception is another angle. While the father's intent was good, using the women's restroom without a designated changing area could make some people uncomfortable. The store might prioritize their policy to prevent potential issues, even if the situation is understandable.\n\nI think the father made a mistake by not following the store's policy. Even if the store didn't have proper facilities, entering a different restroom could be seen as violating their rules, regardless of the reason. So the answer might be A, but I'm not 100% sure because there are exceptions in some places for diaper changes. However, the store's policy usually takes precedence unless there's a law protecting it.\n"
