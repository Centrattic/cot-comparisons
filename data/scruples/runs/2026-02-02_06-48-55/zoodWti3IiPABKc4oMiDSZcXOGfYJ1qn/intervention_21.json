They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper when the men's room didn't have a changing station.\n\nFirst, I know that many places have baby changing stations in both men's and women's restrooms, but maybe this store didn't. The father tried the men's room first, which is understandable since he's a male. But if there's no changing station there, what's the alternative? Sometimes stores might have them in the women's room but not the men's, which is a separate issue, but the father had to act quickly.\n\nHe asked a store worker, who said no other restrooms had changing stations. So he went to the women's room. Now, using the women's restroom as a man could be seen as inappropriate, but he had a baby to care for. However, most places have policies about restroom use based on gender, so even if it's for a child, entering the opposite gender's restroom might violate those policies. \n\nThe key points here are: the father's intent was to care for his child, but the store's policy likely prohibits men from using the women's restroom regardless of the reason. The store manager allowed him to finish but then asked him to leave. Legally, the store can enforce their own policies, even if they might be seen as discriminatory. The father might not have a strong legal case here because businesses can set their own rules. \n\nSo, while the father's situation is understandable, he might have violated the store's policy. The question is whether he's an asshole. If he was trying to do the right thing by his daughter and there was no other option, maybe not. But using the women's restroom without a proper facility in the men's room could be seen as overstepping, even if the store's policy is flawed. The answer might depend on whether the store's policy is clear and if the father had other options. Since he didn't, maybe he's not in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
