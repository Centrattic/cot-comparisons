They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who used the women's bathroom to change their baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is that the father first tried the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker, who said no other bathrooms had one except maybe a store down the road. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom, changed the diaper, someone saw him and called the manager. He was asked to leave.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are about store policy and societal norms. Let me think. In many public places, changing stations are often located in women's restrooms because they are more commonly associated with caregivers, especially mothers. But men's restrooms might not have them. However, some stores do have family restrooms or gender-neutral ones. But in this case, the store didn't have any, according to the worker.\n\nNow, legally, can a store ask someone to leave for using the wrong restroom? Well, stores can enforce their policies. If the policy says that men can't use women's restrooms, then technically the father violated that policy. But there's also the aspect of necessity here. He had an infant who needed changing, and there was no other option.\n\nBut from a policy standpoint, the store is within their rights to enforce their rules. Even if the situation is inconvenient, the policy is the policy. So the father, while acting out of necessity, did break the store's rules. However, some might argue that the store should have a better policy in place for such situations, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nEthically, some might say he's not wrong because he's a parent in a difficult situation. But legally and according to store policy, he's in the wrong because he didn't follow their rules. Also, even if there's no legal action, the store can still enforce their policies. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he used the women's restroom against the store's policy. However, there's nuance here because of the situation, but the question is about being in the wrong, not sympathy.\n"
