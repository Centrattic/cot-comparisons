They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is a father who was changing his baby's diaper in the women's bathroom because the men's bathroom didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with one nearby. He couldn't wait, so he went into the women's room. A woman came in, got upset, called the manager. Security escorted him out. The store didn't ban him but said it was due to policy. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of the store. In many places, public restrooms are gender-segregated, and using the opposite gender's restroom without a valid reason might be against their policy. However, infants are gender-neutral in terms of needing a changing station. Some stores might have policies that allow parents to use the opposite gender's restroom when necessary, especially if their own doesn't have a changing table. But if the store's policy strictly prohibits that, then the father might be violating it. \n\nLegally, in some places, parents are allowed to use any restroom to change their baby's diaper, regardless of the parent's gender, because the need is urgent and the baby is a minor. Laws can vary, but in many jurisdictions, this is permitted. So the legal aspect might not hold against him. However, the store's own policy could be different. Even if the store's policy is strict, the question is whether the father acted unreasonably. Did he have a valid reason (infant needing a diaper change)? The store worker didn't have any other options, so maybe he had no other choice. \n\nThe store's reaction was to call security and escort him out, but didn't ban him. The user is wondering if he's the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a public policy standpoint, many places have started to allow parents to use any restroom to change their baby's diaper, recognizing that parents without changing tables in their assigned restroom need flexibility. So the father might not be at fault. However, depending on the store's specific policy and local laws, it could vary. But generally, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong, as the need to care for an infant is a legitimate reason. The store's policy might be outdated or rigid, but the father acted out of necessity. The lady who freaked out might have a point if there were privacy concerns, but with an infant, it's a practical issue.\n"
