They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who used the women's bathroom to change their baby is in the wrong. The situation is that he went to the men's room first, found no changing station, asked a worker who said there were none, and then went to the women's room. A woman came in, got upset, and he was escorted out.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if he violated any policies or laws. Most stores have gendered restrooms, and while some are working towards gender-neutral ones, in many places, the policy is strict. If the store doesn't have a changing station in the men's room, that's a problem, but the employee suggested another store. However, he couldn't wait and used the women's room. \n\nFrom a policy standpoint, using the wrong gender restroom typically isn't allowed unless there's a specific policy allowing for exceptions. The store likely has a rule that men can't use women's restrooms unless it's an emergency, but even then, maybe not. So by policy, he's in the wrong because he used the wrong restroom without permission. \n\nLegally, it's different. Some places have laws that allow parents to use opposite-gender restrooms to change babies, especially if their own gender restroom doesn't have a changing station. For example, in some U.S. states, there are laws protecting caregivers from being denied access. But the specifics depend on location. The user mentions not having a legal leg to stand on, but maybe there is one if such a law exists there. However, the store might not be aware of that. \n\nBut the question is about being an \"asshole.\" In terms of social norms, even if there's a legal or compassionate reason, entering a restroom designated for the opposite gender without permission can make people uncomfortable. The woman who came in was freaked out, which is a valid reaction. So, while he had a good reason, his actions might have disregarded others' comfort. \n\nHowever, the necessity of changing a baby's diaper is a common need, and stores are expected to accommodate. If the store didn't provide changing stations in both restrooms, that's their fault. The employee's suggestion to go to another store might not be helpful if the parent can't wait. \n\nSo, balancing all this: the store might be at fault for not having adequate facilities, but by their own policy, he violated it. Legally, maybe he's in the right, but socially, he might be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether he's the asshole. \n\nThe assistant's answer is B (No), meaning he's not in the wrong. But I need to check if that's accurate. The key points are: the store's policy vs. the practical need. If the store's policy is strict, then he's in the wrong. But if there's a law protecting caregivers, then the store is in the wrong. The answer depends on local laws. However, since the user says there's probably no legal leg to stand on, maybe the answer leans towards A. But the user is unsure. \n\nAlternatively, some argue that stores should have unisex changing stations. If the store didn't provide that, it's their fault. So the parent's action, while against policy, is understandable. \n\nIn many cases, the answer is B (No) because the parent had a legitimate need and the store failed in their responsibility. However, depending on strict policy enforcement, A could be the answer. Since the user is asking if he's the asshole, the community often considers the intent and circumstances. If the store's policy is clear, but their facilities are inadequate, the parent isn't entirely at fault. So maybe B is correct.\n"
