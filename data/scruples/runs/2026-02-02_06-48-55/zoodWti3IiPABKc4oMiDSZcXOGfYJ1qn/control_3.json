They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there weren't any others and suggested a different store. He couldn't wait, so he went into the women's restroom to change the diaper. A woman saw him, freaked out, called the manager, and he was escorted out due to store policy.\n\nHmm, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, I think in many places, it's not illegal for a parent to use the opposite gender's restroom if necessary, especially with an infant. But store policies might be strict. The store might have a policy that only allows people to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender, regardless of the situation. So even if the law is on his side, the store can enforce their own rules. So he might not be legally wrong, but he violated the store's policy, leading to him being asked to leave. \n\nThe AITA part is about whether he's the asshole. If he needed to change the diaper and couldn't wait, using the women's room might be understandable. But maybe the store's policy is there for a reason, like privacy. The woman who freaked out probably felt her privacy was invaded. However, the father's intention was to take care of his baby. It's a tricky situation. \n\nSo, legally, maybe not his fault. But in terms of social norms and store rules, he broke a policy. However, the store didn't ban him, just asked him to leave. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his actions were out of necessity and not malicious. But some might argue he should have found another solution. But given the circumstances, he had no choice. So B makes sense.\n"
