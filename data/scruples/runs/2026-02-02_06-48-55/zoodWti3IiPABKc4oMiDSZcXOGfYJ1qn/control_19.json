They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father was in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper when the men's bathroom didn't have a changing station. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. Most stores have policies that single-stall unisex restrooms for changing babies. But if the men's restroom didn't have a changing table, maybe the store didn't provide one. However, using the women's restroom would typically be against their policy. \n\nThen there's the legal aspect. In some places, it's legal for fathers to use women's restrooms if they're changing a diaper, especially if the men's restroom doesn't have a changing table. But store policies can vary, and they can ask someone to leave if they violate those policies, even if it's not illegal.\n\nThe man did ask a worker first and was told to try another store. But he couldn't wait, so he used the women's restroom. Some might see this as a reasonable action to care for his child, while others might argue that he should have followed the store's direction. \n\nThe reaction of the lady and the manager shows a conflict in social norms and policies. The store's policy might prioritize the comfort of other customers, even if it's a public necessity like diaper changing. \n\nSo, legally, maybe he's not in the wrong, but ethically or by store policy, he might be. The answer depends on whether the store's policy overrides his need. Since the store asked him to leave, maybe he's in the wrong according to their rules. But if the law supports his action, it's a different story. However, the question is about being the \"asshole,\" which is more about social judgment. Some might see him as justified, others as violating norms. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to care for his child, and if there's no legal violation, but maybe the store's policy is strict. However, if the store's policy is clear and he violated it, then A. But given the context, the answer might be B.\n"
