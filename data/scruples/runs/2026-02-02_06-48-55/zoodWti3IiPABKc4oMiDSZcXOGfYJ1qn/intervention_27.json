They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's room but didn't find a changing station. Then he asked a store worker and was told to try another store. But he couldn't wait, so he went to the women's restroom. A lady saw him, got upset, and called the manager. The manager had him escorted out due to store policy.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about store policies and societal norms. Most public restrooms have changing stations, but they're typically in the women's restroom because of historical reasons and the assumption that mothers are primary caregivers. However, there's a growing movement for more inclusive facilities, like family restrooms or unisex changing areas. \n\nThe father's actions might be seen as understandable because he had a legitimate need to change his baby's diaper. But the store's policy likely prohibits men from using the women's restroom, especially without a family room. The store worker might not have known about alternative options, but the father's decision to enter the women's room despite no changing station there could be problematic. \n\nLegally, in some places, there might be laws protecting parents of the opposite sex from being discriminated against in public restrooms when caring for children. However, store policies can override that, and the store might enforce their policy strictly to maintain the comfort of their customers. \n\nSo, ethically, the father might have a point in needing to care for his child, but he did violate the store's policy. The store's response was to remove him, which is within their rights. The question is whether he's the asshole. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but others might sympathize. \n\nIn terms of the answer, I need to decide between A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the situation, the store's policy is likely in place to prevent such conflicts. While his intent was good, using the women's restroom without a family room is against standard policy. So the answer might be A. But some might argue B because of the necessity. However, the store's policy is there for a reason, and he should have followed the worker's advice to go to another store. Therefore, A (Yes, in the wrong) seems correct.\n"
