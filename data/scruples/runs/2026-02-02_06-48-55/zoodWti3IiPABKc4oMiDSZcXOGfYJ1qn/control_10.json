They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who was changing his baby in the women's restroom because the men's didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker, they said there were none, and he couldn't wait, so he went to the women's room. A woman saw him, freaked out, called the manager, and he was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and policies. In many places, laws allow parents to use gender-appropriate restrooms for changing babies. For example, in the US, the ADA requires accessible diaper-changing facilities in public restrooms. But if the men's restroom doesn't have one, maybe the store isn't ADA compliant. However, the store's policy might not allow men in women's restrooms regardless of the situation. So the father might be violating the store's policy even if legally he's in the right.\n\nAlso, societal norms play a role. While it's increasingly accepted for parents to use any restroom, there might still be discomfort, especially if someone of the opposite gender is present. The store's policy could be strict about separating genders to avoid such conflicts.\n\nLegal action might not be feasible because the store's policy is about their right to enforce rules, even if they're not illegal. If the store is following its policy, they can ask someone to leave, even if it's not against the law. So the father might not be in legal trouble, but he's in violation of the store's policy, which means the store is within their rights to remove him.\n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? Legally, maybe not, but ethically or according to store policy, yes. The question is whether the user is the \"asshole.\" If the store's policy prohibits it, the father is in the wrong in their eyes, even if legally innocent. But the answer hinges on the specific policies and laws. If the store's policy is strict, then the father is in the wrong (A). If the law allows it, then maybe not (B). But since the store enforced their policy, the answer leans towards A.\n"
