They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's restroom, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store employee, who said there were no other options nearby. Desperate, he went to the women's restroom and changed the diaper. A woman saw him, got upset, and the manager made him leave.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, changing a baby in a women's bathroom could be an issue because it's a gender-segregated space. Even though the intention is good, using the wrong bathroom when there's a policy against it could be seen as violating store rules. Legally, stores often have policies that require using the appropriate restroom based on gender, especially if it's for privacy reasons. The manager's action was to enforce that policy, so the father might be in the wrong in their eyes.\n\nHowever, there's a moral argument here. A father trying to care for his infant is understandable. Maybe the store should have accommodations for parents. But the store employee didn't direct him elsewhere, and he didn't have a choice. Still, the policy violation is there. The answer might be A, but it's a bit nuanced. The user's own thought is that he's in the wrong, which aligns with the answer A.\n"
