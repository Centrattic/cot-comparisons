They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he went to the women's restroom to change her. A lady saw him, got upset, and called the manager. He was escorted out but not banned.\n\nSo, the question is whether he was in the wrong. Legally, changing a baby in a women's restroom might be a policy violation. Most stores have rules about using the correct restroom for gender. Even if it's for a baby, the policy is there for a reason. But from a moral standpoint, the father was just trying to take care of his child. There's a common-sense argument that parents should be able to do what's necessary. However, the store's policy is about maintaining privacy and comfort for others. The manager had to enforce the rule, even if the situation was understandable. Legally, he might not have a case because it's a policy issue, not a legal one. So, he might be in the wrong according to the store's rules, but the situation is sympathetic. The answer probably leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because he violated the store's policy, even if unintentionally. But there's nuance here. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just policy. If the policy is designed to prevent such situations, then he did something wrong. So, A is the likely answer.\n"
