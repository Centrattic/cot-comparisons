They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the dad is in the wrong here. So, he was out with his baby and needed to change her diaper. He went to the men's restroom first, but there was no changing station. Then he asked a store employee, who said there were none available and suggested a different store. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom and changed the diaper. A woman walked in, got upset, called the manager, and he was escorted out because of store policy.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about store policies and societal norms. In many places, public restrooms are gender-segregated, so using the opposite gender's restroom without permission could be against the store's rules. Even if there's no legal issue (since changing a baby's diaper is a common need), store policies often require using the correct restroom to avoid discomfort or legal issues for the establishment. The store might have policies in place to prevent misunderstandings or to comply with health codes. So, while the dad's intention was to take care of his baby, the store's policy likely prohibits men from using the women's restroom regardless of the reason. Therefore, he violated the store's policy, leading to his removal. Legally, he might not be liable, but morally or according to the store's rules, he was in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
