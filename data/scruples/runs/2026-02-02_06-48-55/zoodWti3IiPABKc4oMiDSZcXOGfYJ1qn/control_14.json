They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He went to the men's room first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with one and suggested a store nearby. But he couldn't wait, so he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, got upset, called the manager, and he was escorted out.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many places, laws require that parents have access to diaper-changing facilities. However, sometimes men's rooms don't have them. The store might have a policy against men using women's restrooms, which the father didn't know. But also, some places have policies that allow diaper changes for infants regardless of gender. \n\nOn one hand, the father had a legitimate need. On the other, he violated the store's policy. Legally, it might depend on local laws. For example, in some states, parents can use any restroom if necessary. But the store might not be obligated to allow men in women's restrooms. The manager followed their policy, even if it's not legally required. \n\nThe father might not be legally wrong, but he could be in the wrong according to the store's policies. However, if laws protect parents, then he's not in the wrong. The answer hinges on local laws and store policies. If the store's policy is strict and there's no legal exception, then he's in the wrong. If legal protections exist, then he's not.\n"
