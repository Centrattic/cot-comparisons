      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who tried to change his baby's diaper in the men's room but found no changing station. He then went to the women's restroom, which did have a changing station, and got caught. The store removed him based on policy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws. In many places, it's legal for fathers to use women's restrooms if necessary, especially for diaper changes. Some states have laws protecting parents from being prohibited from using opposite-gender facilities for caregiving. However, store policies might conflict with that. The store might have their own rules against it, regardless of local laws.\n\nThe key points here are legality vs. store policy. Even if it's legal, if the store's policy prohibits it, they can enforce removal. But if the law protects parents, the store might be overstepping. Also, the manager allowed him to finish changing the diaper before removing him, which suggests they didn't see it as an immediate threat but still followed their policy.\n\nThe user's intent was to care for his child, which is understandable. The store's policy likely aims to respect privacy for others. However, the woman who freaked out might not have considered the situation. The question is whether the user violated any law or the store's policy. If the store's policy is strict, then he's in the wrong according to their rules. Legally, it might be a different story.\n\nSo, the answer depends on jurisdiction. If the user is in a place where such actions are protected, then he's not in the wrong. But if the store's policy is the governing factor here, then he is. Since the user mentions legal action but thinks there's no leg to stand on, maybe the store's policy is stronger in this case. But I'm not entirely sure. Need to check if there are specific laws in the US about this. In some states, like California, there are laws allowing parents to use opposite-gender facilities. If that's the case, then the store's policy can't override the law. But if there's no such law, then the store can enforce their policy. Since the user didn't specify location, it's hard to say for sure. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the store's policy is clear and he violated it, then he is. If the law allows it, then the store is in the wrong. The user is asking if he's the asshole, which might be more about social judgment than legal. Even if he's not legally wrong, socially some might see him as inconsiderate. But others might side with him for being a caring parent. The answer hinges on whether the user violated the law or just the store's policy. Since the user is unsure about legal action, maybe the store's policy isn't legally enforceable. But the manager did remove him, which is their right to protect their policies. So, if the store's policy is clear, then he's in the wrong. But if the law protects him, then the store is wrong. Since the user is in the US and there's a possibility of such laws, maybe the answer is he's not in the wrong. But I'm not certain. Need to consider both angles. The user's question is about being the asshole, not just legally. So even if he's not legally wrong, socially he might be seen as inconsiderate. But the store's policy might be the real issue here. If the store has a changing station in the men's room, but it's out of order, they should have a policy to handle such cases. However, using the women's room might be necessary. So the answer could be that he's not in the wrong if the store didn't provide adequate facilities. But the store's policy says he is. It's a bit of a gray area. The user's main question is whether he's the asshole, which is a social judgment. So in the context of AITA, people might split. Some would say the store overreacted, others that he should have found another solution. Given the options, the answer is probably A or B. If the user is in the US, and there's a law allowing it, then B. If not, A. Since the user is unsure about legal action, maybe the store's policy is stronger. So the answer might be A. But I'm not 100% sure. I'll go with A because store policies often take precedence in such situations unless there's a specific law, and the user violated the store's rules, making him the asshole in their eyes.\n"
