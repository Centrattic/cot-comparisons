      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change an infant's diaper. The situation is that the author is a father who went to a department store with his baby. He checked the men's room and found no changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who couldn't help, so he used the women's restroom. A woman saw him, got upset, and he was escorted out by security. The question is whether he's the asshole (AITA) and thus at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, laws regarding bathroom access can vary. Some states in the US have laws that allow parents to use opposite-sex bathrooms if necessary for changing diapers. For example, some states have \"bathroom access for families\" laws. So legally, the author might not be at fault. But this depends on local laws. If the store's policy prohibits this, there's a conflict between policy and law. If the law permits it, the store would be in the wrong for enforcing their policy against him. \n\nNext, social norms and store policies. Even if it's legal, store policies can be strict. The store worker didn't know about other options, so maybe the store's policy is not accommodating enough for families. However, the store has the right to enforce its policies, even if they're not the most family-friendly. The author might have known about the policy but chose to ignore it. Was he aware that the men's room didn't have a changing station? If he's used the store before, maybe he's aware. But in this case, he asked a worker and they couldn't help. So he might have had no choice. But still, the store's policy is what was enforced here.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to use the opposite-gender bathroom for a baby? Some people might find it uncomfortable, but others see it as necessary. The woman who freaked out might have felt violated, but the author had a baby to care for. The key here is that the baby's needs are urgent. However, in many stores, the presence of a baby doesn't override the policy, especially if there's a separate family restroom or if the employee could have helped.\n\nLegal action could be a factor. If the author was legally allowed to use the women's bathroom, then the store's action might be illegal. But if the store policy is clear and the author didn't comply, then the store is within their rights to ask him to leave. The manager said it was for \"store policy reasons,\" which might mean they don't have a legal obligation to allow it. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes stores have family restrooms with both genders. If this store doesn't have any, maybe they should improve their facilities. But the author's actions here were based on the information given. If the store worker didn't know about another option, maybe the store is at fault for not providing adequate facilities. However, the author still used the women's room, which might not be allowed regardless of the store's facilities.\n\nSo, putting it all together. Legally, depending on location, the author might not be at fault. But store policy likely says he is. The question is whether the store's policy is enforceable or if it's against the law. If the law allows it, then the store is in the wrong. If the law doesn't, then the author is in the wrong. Since the answer has to be A or B based on general knowledge, without specific location laws mentioned, it's tricky. However, in many places, using a parent's opposite-gender bathroom for diaper changing is protected by law to prevent parents from being put in a difficult situation. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but if the store's policy is strict and the law doesn't cover it, then A. But since the user mentions that the author thinks there might not be a legal leg to stand on, maybe the store's policy is the main issue here. However, if the law supports the parent, then the store is wrong. Without knowing the exact location, it's hard, but generally, in many areas, parents can use either bathroom for a baby. So B might be the answer.\n"
