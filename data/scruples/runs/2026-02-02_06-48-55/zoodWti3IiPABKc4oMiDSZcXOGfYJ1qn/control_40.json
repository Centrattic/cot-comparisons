      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nHe's a father with an infant daughter who needed a diaper change. He first went to the men's room but there was no changing station. Then he asked a store worker and was told there weren't any others nearby. He went into the women's restroom to change her but someone saw him, called the manager, and he was escorted out. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are: he was trying to take care of his baby, the men's room didn't have a changing station, he couldn't find another one, and so he went into the women's room. The store's policy prohibits that, leading to him being asked to leave.\n\nFirst, in many places, there are laws about diaper changing. In some places, public restrooms might require that diaper changing is done in designated facilities. For example, in some areas, men are allowed to use the women's restroom for diaper changes if there's no changing table in the men's room, but this can vary by location. However, store policies might be stricter. If the store's policy explicitly prohibits men from using the women's restroom except under certain circumstances (like if there's a changing table there), then he violated the policy.\n\nBut legally, in some places, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that diaper changing tables be available in public restrooms, but that's usually in newer facilities or those undergoing renovations. If the store doesn't have changing tables in the men's room, maybe they're out of compliance, but that's a separate issue. The father's immediate need to change his baby's diaper might be seen as necessary, but the method of using the women's restroom without permission from the store could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the presence of a changing table in the women's room might not be guaranteed. If there was no changing table there either, then he's in a tough spot. But the store worker didn't mention that there were changing tables in the women's restroom, just that there were no other bathrooms with one. So perhaps the women's room does have a changing table, but maybe he was supposed to use it only if the store allows it for male caregivers.\n\nAnother angle: privacy. Even if there's no changing table, entering a restroom designated for the opposite gender without a clear purpose (like a baby to change) could be seen as violating the privacy of others. The lady who walked in was probably there for her own needs, and his presence might have made her uncomfortable or felt like an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut the father's intent was to care for his infant, which is a legitimate need. If the store doesn't have any changing facilities, maybe they're at fault. However, the store's policy is to have their own rules, and enforcing those is within their rights. So legally, he might not be in the wrong if the store's policy is unclear or if they don't provide adequate facilities, but under the store's specific rules, he violated them by entering the women's restroom without permission.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might understand the necessity, while others might see it as inappropriate. The key is whether the store's policy was clear. If he was unaware of the policy, he might be less in the wrong than if he was told not to do it. But in this case, he asked a worker and was told there were no other bathrooms with changing stations, which might mean that the worker didn't inform him about the women's bathroom policy.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on local laws and store policies. If legally he's allowed to use the women's restroom for diaper changes, then the store's action might be unwarranted. But if the store's policy prohibits that, then he violated their rules, even if done out of necessity. The question is whether the father is in the wrong. If the store's policy is strict, then yes, he's in the wrong for violating it. If there's a law that allows it, then maybe not. But without specific information on local laws, the default answer would be that he violated the store's policy, making him the asshole in their eyes. However, the moral argument might be in his favor because he was trying to care for his child. But the question is about being in the wrong, which could be both legally and socially.\n\nGiven that the store had a policy and he was removed for violating it, even if it was out of necessity, he might be considered in the wrong by the store's standards. However, in some places, there are exceptions. But without knowing the specific location, it's hard. The community might split, but the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually emphasizes social norms over strict legalities. In that case, some might say he's not the asshole because he was taking care of his child, but others would say he should have found another way, like using the men's room if there's a changing table there, but there wasn't. So it's a bit of a nuanced case.\n"
