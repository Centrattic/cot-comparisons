They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's restroom, which didn't have a changing station. Then he approached a store employee who couldn't help and suggested another store. Since he couldn't wait, he went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, got upset, and called the manager. The manager allowed him to finish but then had him escorted out for store policy reasons.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father was in the wrong. Legally, in many places, men are allowed to use women's restrooms for diaper changes if there's no other option, especially if they're not using any stalls and are in the family changing area. However, store policies might be strict, even if they don't align with legal standards. The key here is whether the store's policy is enforceable or if the father had a right to use the facility regardless.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there are laws that protect parents from being restricted in this way. For example, in the U.S., the ADA requires accessible diaper-changing tables in both men's and women's restrooms. But if the store didn't have those, maybe the father had a right to use the women's restroom. However, if the store's policy explicitly prohibits non-gender-specific use, they might enforce that, even if it's not legally sound.\n\nThe father's intent was to care for his baby, which is a valid reason. The store's reaction might be based on policy rather than legal obligation. The lady's reaction could be due to discomfort, but that doesn't necessarily make the father wrong. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's the asshole, not strictly legal. Public restrooms are for public use, and if there's no other option, using the women's restroom for a diaper change might be acceptable. The store's policy might be problematic, but the father's action was out of necessity. So, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
