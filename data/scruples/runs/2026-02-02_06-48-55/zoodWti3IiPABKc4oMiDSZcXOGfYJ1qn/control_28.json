They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby. The situation is that he was in a store with his infant daughter, tried the men's room which didn't have a changing station, asked a worker, was told to maybe go to another store, but couldn't wait. So he went into the women's restroom, changed the diaper, a woman freaked out, called the manager, he was allowed to finish but then escorted out for store policy. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in many places, gender-specific restrooms have policies that might not allow men to enter the women's restroom, even for a baby change. But some places have laws allowing parents to use the opposite gender restroom if needed, especially for infants. However, store policies can vary. The store's policy might strictly prohibit men from entering women's restrooms regardless of the reason. \n\nFrom a social perspective, while the father's intention was to care for his child, using the women's restroom might make others uncomfortable. Some people might understand the need, but others might feel it's inappropriate. The store's response (removing him) is likely based on their policy to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all customers. \n\nLegally, the father might not have a strong case unless there's a law explicitly allowing it. The store's policy takes precedence in this case. So, while the father's action was well-intentioned, he violated the store's policy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong according to the store's rules, even if some people sympathize with his situation. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he broke the store's policy, leading to his removal.\n"
