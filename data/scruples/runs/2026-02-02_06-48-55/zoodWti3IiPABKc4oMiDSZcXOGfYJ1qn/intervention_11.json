      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a father with an infant daughter who needs a diaper change. He first goes to the men's room, which doesn't have a changing station. Then he asks a store worker, who says there are no other bathrooms with changing stations nearby. He can't wait, so he goes into the women's restroom and changes the baby. A woman walks in, freaks out, and he's escorted out by security. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. Well, the main issue here is using the women's bathroom without a changing station. In many places, especially in the U.S., laws regarding bathroom access can be a bit tricky. But I remember that in some states, like California, there's a law that allows parents of young children to use any accessible restroom to change a diaper. However, the store might have its own policies. Also, the presence of a changing station in the men's room is important. If the men's room doesn't have one, and the store doesn't have any other access, maybe the father had no choice. But if he went into the women's restroom, which is against the store's policy, even if there's no legal issue, he might be violating their rules. The store might have a strict policy against non-gender-specific use, even if it's for a baby. Also, the woman who walked in and felt violated\u2014her experience is valid. So from a policy standpoint, the store might have a right to remove him. Legally, it could vary. But the question is about being an asshole, which is about social norms and consideration. Even if he's not breaking the law, using the women's restroom without a changing station might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if there were other options. Wait, but he asked the store worker and they said there were no other options. So maybe he had no choice. But still, entering the women's restroom without a changing station might be against store policy. So the store's action could be justified. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit confused because some places allow it. Need to check if there's a law in the area, but since the story doesn't specify, maybe we assume there's no such law. Then, it's about the store's policy. The author didn't follow the store's rules, so even if he had a good reason, he violated their policy. So in terms of being an asshole, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but the store's side is also valid. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the store's policy is clear that only the designated bathroom is allowed, and he went against that, then he might be in the wrong. But if the store doesn't have any changing stations, even in the men's room, maybe it's their fault. But the author went into the women's restroom which isn't supposed to have a changing station. So the store's policy might require using the men's room for changing, even if there's no changing station. But that seems illogical. Hmm. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he violated the store's policy, even if it was for a good reason. The store's policy is about using the correct bathroom, and he didn't follow that, leading to the woman's discomfort. So he's the asshole.\n"
