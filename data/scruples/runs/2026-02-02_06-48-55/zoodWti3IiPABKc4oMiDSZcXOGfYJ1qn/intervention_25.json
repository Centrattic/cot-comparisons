      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a dad with an infant daughter, and he needed to change her diaper. He went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said no and suggested another store. But he couldn't wait, so he went into the women's restroom to change the baby. A lady saw him, freaked out, called the manager, and he was escorted out. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In some places, laws might allow for parents to use opposite-gender restrooms if they're caring for an infant. But I'm not sure. Maybe there are specific laws about this. However, the store's policy is probably more about what they enforce. Even if legally he's allowed, if the store has a policy against it, they can ask him to leave for violating that policy. Stores do have their own rules, right? So even if he's not breaking the law, he's breaking the store's rules, which could lead to being asked to leave.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. Some people might find it uncomfortable to see a man in the women's restroom, even with an infant. The woman who saw him freaked out, which makes sense because it's an unexpected situation. Even if intentions are good, entering a restricted space can cause discomfort or fear. So the store might prioritize maintaining a safe and comfortable environment for all customers, hence enforcing their policy strictly.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that parents should have access to changing facilities. Many stores do have changing stations in men's rooms or gender-neutral restrooms. If this store didn't have any, maybe they're at fault for not providing adequate facilities. But the father's actions still involved entering a space meant for women, which the store might not have control over if their policies are strict.\n\nSo the question is: is the father in the wrong for entering the women's restroom without a changing station, even if it was out of necessity? Legally, maybe not, but socially and according to store policy, he likely is. The store can enforce their own rules regardless of the reason. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong because he violated the store's policy, even if his intentions were good. But maybe some people would argue the store should have better facilities. However, given the scenario, the immediate consequence was his removal, so the store's policy is the main issue here.\n"
