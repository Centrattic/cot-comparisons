They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's bathroom but found no changing station. Then he checked with a store employee, who didn't have any other options. He ended up using the women's restroom because he couldn't wait. A woman walked in, got upset, and he was escorted out by security.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, I think in many places, there's no law that prohibits men from using women's restrooms for a legitimate reason like changing a diaper, especially if there are no other options. But store policies might be different. Stores often have their own rules, and if their policy says that men can't use the women's restroom for that purpose, then they might enforce that. However, some stores do have family restrooms or unisex facilities.\n\nThe father tried the men's room first, which usually doesn't have changing stations. The store employee suggested another store, but he couldn't wait. His actions were to take care of his baby, which is a reasonable need. The store's response was to remove him, but not banning him permanently. There's a possibility that the store's policy is discriminatory or outdated, especially if they don't have family-friendly facilities. Legally, he might not have a strong case, but in terms of social responsibility, the store could be at fault for not providing adequate facilities.\n\nSo, considering both the legal and social angles, the father's actions were necessary and not malicious. The store's policy might be the real issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
