They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me think about this. The situation is a father changing his baby's diaper in the women's bathroom when the men's room didn't have a changing station. The store worker didn't have another option, so he went into the women's restroom. A woman saw him, got upset, and he was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws. In many places, it's legal for men to use women's restrooms when necessary, especially for childcare. However, store policies can vary. Even if it's legal, the store might have their own rules. The manager followed the store's policy by asking him to leave, which is their right as a business. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's intent was to care for his child. It's a common issue that men's bathrooms often lack changing stations, which is a societal problem. But does that justify using the women's bathroom? Some people might argue that it's necessary, while others might say he should have found an alternative, like a public park or a different store. \n\nThe key here is that the store's policy is strict. Even if the law allows it, the business can enforce their rules. So, the father might not be legally in the wrong, but he violated the store's policy. The question is whether that makes him an asshole. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, he was trying to do what's best for his baby. However, entering a women's restroom without permission could make others uncomfortable, even if his intention was good. The store's policy might be in place to protect privacy and prevent such situations. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the store's policy is clear, he violated it. But the situation was an emergency. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether you prioritize the store's policies over the father's immediate need. I think the father wasn't in the wrong legally, but perhaps ethically or by the store's rules, he was. The question is about being an asshole, so maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his intent was good, even if the action conflicted with policy.\n"
