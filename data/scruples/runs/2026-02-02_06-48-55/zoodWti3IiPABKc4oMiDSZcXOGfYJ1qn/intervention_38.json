They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a father who took his infant daughter to a store and needed to change her diaper. He first tried the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. He asked a worker, who said there were none and suggested a nearby store. But he couldn't wait, so he went into the women's restroom and changed the diaper. A woman walked in, freaked out, called the manager, and he was escorted out due to store policy.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about store policies and public bathroom usage. In many places, public restrooms are segregated by gender, and policies often prohibit non-binary individuals from using the opposite gender's facilities. However, when it comes to parents with infants, some stores have unisex family restrooms. But this store didn't have those, and the worker didn't know of any others.\n\nThe father's intent was to take care of his baby, which is a common parental need. But using the women's restroom without a changing station might have violated their policy. Even if there's no legal action, the store has the right to enforce their own policies. The manager's response was to remove him, which is within their authority to maintain their policies and ensure customer comfort. \n\nNow, considering the baby's needs, it's understandable, but the store's policy is there for a reason. The father could have called ahead to check for facilities or brought a portable changing pad. The store might not have a legal issue here because it's their policy, and they can ask someone to leave for violating it. \n\nSo, the father might have acted out of necessity, but by entering the women's restroom without a changing station, he violated the store's rules. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he disregarded the store's policies even though he had alternatives or could have handled it differently.\n"
