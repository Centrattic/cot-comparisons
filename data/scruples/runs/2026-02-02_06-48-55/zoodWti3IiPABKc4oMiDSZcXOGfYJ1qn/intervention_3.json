They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is that he went to the men's room first but there was no changing station. He asked a store worker, who said there weren't any others nearby. He then went to the women's bathroom, changed the diaper, a woman saw him, got upset, and he was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, public restrooms are designated by gender, and using the opposite gender's restroom without permission could be against the store's policies. However, there's also the argument that parents should have access to change their infants, and some places have laws requiring diaper-changing stations in all restrooms regardless of gender. So legally, maybe he's not in the wrong if the store didn't have a changing station in the men's room.\n\nThen there's the store's policy. The store worker told him there were no other restrooms with changing stations. If the store's policy prohibits men from using women's restrooms, then he violated that policy. But if the store is required by law to provide changing facilities, maybe the store is at fault for not having them.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, a parent trying to care for an infant might be considered reasonable. On the other hand, entering a different gender's restroom could make others uncomfortable and might be against social norms or policies.\n\nThe store's response was to have him escorted out. If the store's policy is strict and he violated it, then he might be in the wrong. But if the store failed to provide a necessary facility, maybe they share some responsibility.\n\nLegally, some places have laws allowing parents to use any restroom for changing a diaper. For example, in the US, some states have passed laws to prevent discrimination against parents in this context. If that's the case here, then the store's action might be unlawful.\n\nBut without knowing the specific location and laws, it's hard to say. However, the user's own thought is that he's in the wrong, but others might disagree. The key factors are the presence of changing stations in men's rooms, store policies, and local laws.\n\nIf the store didn't have a changing station in the men's room, the father might not have a legal issue. If the store's policy clearly prohibits men from using women's restrooms, then he violated that policy. However, if the store is in violation of laws requiring diaper-changing facilities, then he might be in the right.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on the specific laws in the area. But generally, if the store didn't provide a changing station in the men's room and he had no other option, it's a policy violation but not necessarily a legal one. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically or under store policy, he might be.\n"
