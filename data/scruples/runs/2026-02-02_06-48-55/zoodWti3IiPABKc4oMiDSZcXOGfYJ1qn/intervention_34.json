They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where he first checked the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker, was told there wasn't another option nearby, and then went to the women's restroom. A woman saw him, freaked out, and called the manager. He was allowed to finish but then escorted out. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, laws regarding restroom use for changing infants can vary. Some states or countries have laws that allow parents to use any restroom if necessary, especially if there's no other option. However, store policies might be strict about this, even if the law is more lenient. The store might have a policy that all parents must use the men's room or a designated area, regardless of whether it has a changing station.\n\nThen there's the ethical and social perspective. The father's intention was to take care of his baby, which is a responsible action. However, entering a restroom meant for the opposite gender could make others uncomfortable, even if the intention is good. It's important to balance the needs of the parent against the comfort and privacy of others.\n\nThe store worker told him there were no other options, but maybe the store should have had a policy to handle such situations. Some stores provide accessible changing stations in men's rooms or have family restrooms. If the store didn't have these, they might share some responsibility for not accommodating parents properly.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father might have a case if local laws permit using any restroom for infants. For example, in some U.S. states, it's legal for parents to use any restroom to change diapers if necessary. However, if the store's policy strictly prohibits this, they could argue that the father violated their rules, even if it's not illegal.\n\nThe manager's response was to have him escorted out but didn't ban him. The father is unsure about legal action. The key here is whether the store's policy is legally enforceable or if there's a law that protects parents in such situations.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's a bit nuanced. The father acted out of necessity, but he didn't consider the potential discomfort of others. However, he did check the men's room first and sought help from staff before entering the women's restroom, which shows he tried to find a solution. The store's policy might be outdated or not accommodating to modern parenting needs.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might depend on the specific laws in the area and the store's policies. If the law supports the father, then he's not in the wrong. If the store's policy is clear and he violated it, even if not illegal, he might be seen as in the wrong from a policy standpoint. However, ethically, his actions were to care for his child, which is commendable. The store could also be seen as not providing adequate facilities.\n"
