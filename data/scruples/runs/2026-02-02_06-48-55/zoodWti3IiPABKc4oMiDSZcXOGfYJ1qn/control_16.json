They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father who used the women's bathroom to change his baby is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the situation. He went to the men's restroom first, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker and was told there were none. He couldn't wait, so he went to the women's bathroom. A woman saw him, got upset, and he was escorted out.\n\nHmm. Legally, in some places, using a restroom that matches your gender identity is allowed. But since he's a male using the women's restroom, maybe there are policies against that. However, infants need changing stations regardless of gender. Some stores have them in both restrooms, but if the men's didn't, he might have a point. \n\nBut if the store's policy strictly prohibits men from using the women's restroom, even for emergencies, then he might have broken the rules. The manager said \"store policy reasons,\" which could be their own set of rules. However, some places might make exceptions for parents with babies. \n\nThe question is whether he was in the wrong. If the store doesn't have a policy allowing men to use women's restrooms for changing babies, then he violated their policy. But if the policy is discriminatory or not accommodating, maybe he's right. \n\nAlso, considering the manager didn't ban him but just removed him, perhaps there's no criminal issue. It's more about store policy than legal wrong. So, depending on whether the store's policy is legally sound or not. In some places, it's illegal to deny access to restrooms based on gender for parents changing babies. \n\nSo, maybe the father isn't in the wrong if the store's policy is against the law. But if the store has a policy that's within legal bounds, then he violated their rules. The answer might depend on local laws. Since the user didn't specify location, it's hard to say. But generally, parents need to change babies, and stores should accommodate. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But if the store's policy is strict, then A. \n\nWait, the user is asking if he's the asshole here. If he was acting in need of his child and the store was being inflexible, maybe he's not. But if he ignored the policy, maybe he is. It's a bit of a gray area. But in many places, it's considered acceptable for parents to use either restroom if needed. So maybe B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
