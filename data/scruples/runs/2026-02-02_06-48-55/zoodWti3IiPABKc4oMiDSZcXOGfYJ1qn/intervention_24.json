They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first tried the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he went to the women's room, which did have one, but he got in trouble. \n\nHmm, so the key points here are the store's policy and local laws. In many places, laws require that all bathrooms with changing stations be accessible to everyone, regardless of gender. But sometimes, stores might have their own policies. If the store's policy explicitly prohibits non-gendered use, then the father might be violating that.\n\nBut wait, there's a difference between policy and the law. If the law allows fathers to use any bathroom with a changing station, then the store might be acting against the law. However, if the store's policy is strict and they enforce it regardless of legal guidelines, they might have a right to remove him for violating their own rules, even if it's not illegal.\n\nThe father had no other option and couldn't wait. But he should have checked if there's an all-gender restroom or a family restroom. Maybe the store doesn't have those. If the store doesn't have any changing stations in the men's room, that's an issue. But the father's immediate action was to use the women's room when he had to.\n\nSo, legally, in some places, using the opposite gender's bathroom for a diaper change is allowed. But if the store's policy says otherwise, they can remove him. The question is whether using the women's bathroom was the right choice. If there's no other option and the law allows it, he's not in the wrong. But if the store's policy is clear and he should have known, maybe he is.\n\nAlso, the manager's statement about store policy reasons. If the policy is legally permissible, then they have the right to enforce it. But if the policy is discriminatory and against local laws, then they're the ones in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer depends on local laws. If the father's actions are legal, then he's not in the wrong. If the store's policy is within their rights, then he violated it. The user mentioned there's probably no legal leg to stand on, which might indicate that the store's policy is valid, even if it's not the most convenient. Therefore, the father might be in the wrong for violating the store's policy, even if it's not a legal violation.\n"
