They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper. I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: He went to the men's room, found no changing station. Asked a worker, who said there were none and maybe a store down the road. He couldn't wait, so he used the women's restroom. A woman saw him, freaked out, called the manager. They let him finish then had him escorted out.\n\nI think the key points here are about store policy and societal norms. In many places, men's restrooms typically have diaper-changing stations, but sometimes they don't. However, using the women's restroom as a man could be against store policies because of privacy laws. \n\nIn the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and other laws protect against gender discrimination, but they also have policies to protect privacy. Unauthorized entry into a restroom not designated for one's gender could be seen as violating store policy. Even if there's no legal standing, the store can enforce their own rules. \n\nAlso, consider the perspective of the other woman. She might feel violated or uncomfortable seeing a man in the women's restroom. The store's policy is probably in place to prevent such situations to protect all customers' privacy. \n\nThe father had options: ask for a portable changing station, use a public area if available, or wait. But he chose to use the women's restroom, which the store likely prohibits. So even if his intent was innocent, he violated the policy. \n\nLegally, there might not be a case because it's a private property right to set rules. So the store can ask him to leave. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for not following the store's policy.\n"
