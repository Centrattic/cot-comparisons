They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's restroom, which didn't have a changing station, as is common. Then he asked a store worker but was told there were no other options nearby. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom and changed the diaper.\n\nThe key points here are the store's policies and public expectations. In many places, especially in the US, there's a growing trend towards family-friendly policies, including changing stations in men's rooms. However, the store in question might not have one. The father's main issue is using the women's restroom without a valid reason. \n\nLegally, in some states, there are laws allowing men to use women's restrooms to change diapers, especially in emergencies. However, stores often have their own policies, which might not align with the law. The store manager followed their policy by having him removed, which could be justified under their terms. \n\nEthically, the father's intention was to care for his baby, which is a common and understandable need. But the method he chose\u2014entering a restroom designated for the opposite gender without prior permission\u2014might clash with societal norms and the store's operational rules. \n\nThe store didn't ban him permanently, so they might be acknowledging his good intentions but enforcing their policy. Legally, if there's no law supporting his action, he might be out of options. However, if local laws do support such actions, the store's policy could be at fault. \n\nIn conclusion, while the father's intent was noble, the way he handled it might have crossed the line based on the store's policies and societal expectations. So, he's partially at fault, but the store's policy might also be lacking. But based on the scenario given, the answer leans towards him being in the wrong due to not following the store's rules.\n"
