      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a father using the women's restroom to change his baby's diaper because the men's restroom didn't have a changing station. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider store policies. Most stores have specific rules about restroom usage. Typically, they might have changing stations in both men's and women's restrooms, but maybe not always. The father went to the men's room first, which didn't have one. Then he asked a worker, who said there were none. So he went to the women's restroom. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether using the women's restroom was allowed. If the store's policy doesn't allow male customers to use the women's restroom for changing diapers, then the father violated that policy. Even if the store worker didn't know about another option, the store's policy might still prohibit it. The manager escorted him out due to policy, so they had a reason to enforce it.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in some places, anti-discrimination laws might protect people from being excluded based on gender, but that's more about access to facilities like restrooms for transgender individuals. A cisgender father using a women's restroom for a diaper change might not fall under those protections. However, if the store's policy is clear, then the legal aspect might be on the store's side.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the father had a legitimate need, but others might say he should have found another solution, like using a portable changing pad or going to another store. The woman who saw him freaked out, which could be a valid reaction if she felt uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the author's actions violated the store's policy, leading to his removal. Whether he's in the wrong depends on balancing the store's rules against his necessity. But since he didn't follow the policy, even if he had a good reason, he's probably at fault here. Answering A makes sense.\n"
