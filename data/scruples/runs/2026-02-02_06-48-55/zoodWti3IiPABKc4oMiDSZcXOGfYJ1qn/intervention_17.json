They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who used the women's bathroom to change their baby's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is that he went to the men's room but there was no changing station. Then he went to women's restroom, changed the diaper, and got escorted out by security.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of the store. Many stores have different rules regarding diaper changing in restrooms. Some allow it in the men's room if there's a changing station, others might not. If the men's room didn't have one, maybe he shouldn't have gone to the women's. But the main point is that he used the wrong restroom. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of public restrooms and gender policies. Even if the intention was to change a diaper, using the opposite gender's restroom might be against their policy. The store manager mentioned \"store policy reasons,\" so they probably have a rule against that. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the law might vary by location. Some places allow diaper changing in any restroom regardless of gender, especially if there's no other option. But if the store's policy prohibits it, the store could enforce their rules, which might not be illegal but is their right. \n\nThe father's intentions were good, taking care of his baby. However, actions don't always align with the rules. The store worker didn't know other options, but the father proceeded to the women's restroom. Maybe he should have waited or looked for a public changing area outside the store. \n\nThe lady's reaction is understandable due to privacy concerns. Even if it's a baby, some people might feel uncomfortable. The store's response of removing him was following their policy. \n\nSo, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. If the store's policy prohibits using the women's restroom for this, then he violated their rules. Legally, maybe there's a case, but if the store's policy is clear, he might be at fault. \n\nBut maybe in some places, it's acceptable. However, without a legal challenge, the store's action is within their rights. So the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he violated the store's policy, even if his intent was good.\n"
