They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he used the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper because the men's room didn't have a changing station. He asked a store worker, who said there were no other options nearby. Then he went into the women's restroom, a woman freaked out, called the manager, and he was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and policies. In many places, it's legal for fathers or male caregivers to use the women's restroom if necessary for diaper changes, especially when there's no accessible facility. Some states have laws allowing men to use women's restrooms for this purpose. However, store policies might be different. If the store's policy strictly prohibits men from entering women's restrooms regardless of the reason, then the store might have followed their own policy by removing him, even if it's not illegal.\n\nThen, there's the social aspect. Even if legal, some might see it as inappropriate because it could make others uncomfortable. The woman who came in was upset, which suggests that others might feel it's against social norms. But the father's need to care for his child is a valid concern. \n\nThe key points here are: legal vs. policy, the store's policy, and social norms. The author might not be legally wrong if the law permits it, but he might be violating the store's policy, hence being asked to leave. So, the answer would depend on whether the store's policy overrides legal allowances. If the store's policy is strict, then the father might be at fault for violating that, even if it's not illegal. But if the law allows it, the store's policy might be discriminatory or illegal. However, the store can enforce their own policies, so he might be in the wrong according to their rules.\n"
