They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the father is in the wrong for using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper. \n\nFirst, there's the issue of store policy. Most stores have strict policies about which restrooms can be used based on gender. Even if the men's restroom doesn't have a changing station, using the women's restroom is against the policy. The store worker suggested another store, which he didn't follow. Then he went ahead and used the women's restroom, causing a problem when a lady saw him and called the manager.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, public restrooms are gender-segregated, and using the opposite restroom without appropriate access (like a family restroom) can be against the law. Some places have laws allowing parents to use the opposite gender restroom for diaper changes, but this might depend on local ordinances. However, the store's policy might override that, especially if they don't allow it. The store could have their own rules regardless of local laws.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more nuanced. The father was trying to care for his baby, which is a legitimate need. But he didn't check if there was a family restroom available. Maybe there's a family restroom in the store that's not clearly marked. If there's no family restroom, then his options are limited. However, entering a gender-specific restroom without being the correct gender could be seen as violating social norms, even if the intent is good.\n\nThe store's response was to have him escorted out, which is a strong action. If they didn't have a family restroom, maybe they should have been more accommodating. But since he used the women's restroom without permission, the store is following their policy. The father might not be legally wrong if local laws permit it, but he's likely violating store policy. \n\nSo, the key points are store policy vs. individual need. The father might not be the \"asshole\" in terms of intent, but he did break the store's rules. Whether that makes him in the wrong depends on whether the store's policy is enforceable and if there were alternatives he didn't explore.\n"
