They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's restroom, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with one. He went to the women's restroom to change the diaper, but a woman saw him, got upset, and called the manager. The manager had him escorted out. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the store's policies versus the necessity of the situation. In many places, laws require that public restrooms have changing stations, but they might be in gender-specific rooms. However, some states have laws allowing parents to use the opposite gender restroom if necessary. The store might have a strict policy against this, even if the law is on the parent's side. The father was in a situation where waiting wasn't an option for a baby in need. The store's policy might be clear, but legal protections for parents could override that. However, if the store's policy is explicit and he ignored it, he might be at fault. But if the law permits parents to use opposite gender facilities, then the store's policy might be invalid. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer would depend on local laws and the specific store's policies. Without knowing the exact state, it's hard to say definitively, but many places do support parents in this scenario, so he might not be in the wrong.\n"
