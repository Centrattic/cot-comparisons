      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a father who needed to change his baby's diaper. He first went to the men's room, which didn't have a changing station. Then he asked a store worker, who said there were no other bathrooms with changing stations. Since he couldn't wait, he went into the women's restroom and changed the diaper. A woman walked in, got upset, called the manager, and he was escorted out. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. In many places, especially in the US, there's an assumption that men's restrooms don't have diaper-changing stations, but women's restrooms often do. So, the store worker's answer that there are no other bathrooms with changing stations might be incorrect if the men's room lacks one. The father's reasoning was that he had no other options. However, using the women's restroom as a man, even for a diaper change, could be against store policy and societal norms. While it's understandable and many would empathize with a parent needing to care for their child, entering a restroom designated for the opposite gender could be seen as violating privacy and policies. Legally, there might not be a strong case against the store, as they have their own rules about who can use which restrooms. So, while the father's intent was to care for his child, the action itself might be considered wrong due to the policy and potential discomfort of others. But some might argue that the store should have better facilities. Still, the immediate answer is that the father went against store policy, hence in the wrong.\n"
