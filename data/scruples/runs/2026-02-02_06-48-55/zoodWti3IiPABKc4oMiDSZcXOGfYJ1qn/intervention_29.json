They allowed me to finish but then had security escort me out.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me not to come back but they did say that for \u201cstore policy reasons\u201d that I needed to be removed from the premises.\n\nI am not sure if I should consider legal action as there probably isn\u2019t a legal leg to stand on. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering - am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is a father using the women's bathroom to change his baby's diaper because the men's room didn't have a changing station.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and policies. In many places, there are laws that allow parents to use opposite-gender facilities if necessary, especially for diaper changes. However, store policies might be different. The store worker said there were no other bathrooms, so the dad had to act quickly. \n\nBut using the women's bathroom without a changing station could be an issue. Some stores might have policies against it, even if it's legally permitted. The manager removed him based on their policy, which is their right. However, the father's intention was to care for his child. \n\nNow, am I the asshole? The father did what he thought was necessary, but he might have violated the store's specific rules. Legally, maybe he's okay, but socially or according to the store's policies, he might be at fault. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the store's policy is enforceable. If they don't have a changing station in the men's room, the store might be part of the problem. But the father's action still breached the store's policy. So, he's probably in the wrong according to the store's rules, but maybe not legally.\n"
