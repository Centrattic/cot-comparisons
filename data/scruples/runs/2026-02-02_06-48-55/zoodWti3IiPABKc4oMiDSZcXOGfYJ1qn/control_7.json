      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the scenario: A father with an infant daughter goes to a department store to change her diaper. He checks the men's room but there's no changing station. He asks a store worker, who confirms there are no other bathrooms with changing stations nearby. Since he can't wait, he goes into the women's restroom, changes the diaper, a woman sees him and gets upset, calling the manager. He's escorted out due to store policy.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers are allowed to use women's restrooms for diaper changes, especially when necessary. Some stores have policies that allow this, though it can vary. However, store policies are their own thing. The store might have rules against it regardless of local laws. \n\nFrom a social perspective, even if it's legal, entering a women's restroom without using the facilities (i.e., not urinating or defecating) might be seen as acceptable, especially for a baby's needs. But the store's policy is clear in this case\u2014they removed him. \n\nBut the key here is that he didn't have a choice at the time. He checked the men's room, asked the store worker, and there were no alternatives. So he took what he thought was necessary for his baby. However, he did enter a restroom not designated for men, which the store might strictly enforce. \n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, public restrooms are required to have changing stations, but if the men's room doesn't, he might have a right to use the women's. But if the store's policy is strict, they might take action even if it's not against the law. \n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole. The answer depends on whether his actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since he had no other option and was acting in the baby's best interest, many might say he's not in the wrong. However, he did violate the store's policy, which is why he was escorted out. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the store's policy overrides his actions. If the store's policy is clear and he ignored it despite being told there were no other options, maybe he's in the wrong. But if the store didn't provide adequate facilities, he might not be. \n\nI think the key here is that the store's policy, even if it's not legally sound, is their rule. So he might be in the wrong in their eyes, but not necessarily in a legal sense. However, the question is about being the asshole, which is more about social norms. If people generally understand the need for a parent to change a diaper, then he's not the asshole. But if the store strictly enforces gendered restrooms and he should have known better, maybe he is.\n"
