We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing a scholarship. The author has evidence and is considering reporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Alice were friends, but their relationship ended due to Alice's condescending behavior. The author is upset about Alice's academic dishonesty, which affected others by ruining the class curve. The author has concrete evidence, which is important.\n\nNow, the key points here are academic integrity and the obligation to report cheating. In most educational institutions, cheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is a responsibility. The author is taking action not just for personal reasons but also because Alice's actions impacted the entire class. The evidence provided (texts, snaps) supports the claim, which is crucial for a valid report.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of personal vendetta. The author had a falling out with Alice, and there's a possibility that this could be motivated by personal feelings rather than a genuine concern for academic integrity. However, the author mentions that Alice's cheating affected others, which adds a broader justification beyond personal grievances.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is whether the author's intention is to uphold academic standards or to get back at Alice. If the primary motive is revenge, then the action might be considered wrong. However, if the author is acting in the interest of fairness and following institutional policies, then it's justified.\n\nInstitutions usually encourage reporting misconduct to maintain integrity. The author has evidence, so reporting is within the right process. Even if there's a personal conflict, if the evidence is solid, the institution should handle it impartially. The author isn't directly harming Alice; they're providing information for authorities to decide.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong if the report is based on valid evidence and the intent is to address academic dishonesty, which affects everyone. So the answer is B (No).\n"
