We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for reporting their friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing a scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author used to be friends with Alice but had a falling out because Alice was being condescending. Now, Alice is accused of cheating in multiple ways, including in an online exam where she used sticky notes. The author has evidence and wants to report her. The question is if the author is in the wrong by doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is reporting someone for academic dishonesty justified, even if there's a personal history? The author has concrete evidence. Cheating, especially in an online proctored exam, is a serious academic offense. If the evidence is solid, then reporting might be the right thing. But there's also the personal conflict angle. The author might have a motive because of their past friendship and the hurt from Alice's behavior. However, even with personal issues, if there's academic fraud, institutions usually encourage reporting to maintain integrity.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is seeking revenge for how Alice treated them. But the author claims they have enough evidence, which aligns with the university's policies. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but if she indeed cheated, then the action is appropriate. The fact that her cheating affected others (the class curve) adds weight to the seriousness.\n\nI need to consider ethical viewpoints. Academic integrity is a cornerstone of education. Institutions rely on students to uphold standards. If someone cheats, it's a violation that should be addressed. The author's intent might be both personal and ethical, but the existence of evidence and the nature of the cheating (which impacts others) support the action.\n\nHowever, there's a risk of personal bias. The author might not be entirely impartial. But if the process is followed correctly and evidence is presented, the institution can make the decision. It's not the author's role to punish, but to report the misconduct.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a personal angle, the act of reporting academic dishonesty with solid evidence is generally not in the wrong. The institution's policies are there for a reason, and upholding them is important. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
