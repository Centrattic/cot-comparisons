We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Alice were friends. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending, especially about the author's scholarship. Now, Alice is accused of academic dishonesty, including cheating on an online exam. The author has evidence like texts, snaps, and videos. They're considering reporting her to the dean, which could lead to her losing her scholarship, credits, and possible expulsion.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author is justified in reporting Alice. Let's start with the cheating part. Academic dishonesty is a serious offense. If Alice did cheat, then the author is right to report it. However, the author's motivation here is important. Part of their reasoning is that they want to correct the unfair advantage Alice had, which affected the class curve. But another part might be personal\u2014since Alice had been mean to the author. \n\nIs there a conflict of interest here? The author is reporting someone they used to be friends with, possibly out of spite. Even if there's valid evidence, if the report is motivated by personal vendetta rather than the integrity of the academic process, that could be problematic. However, the existence of concrete evidence (texts, snaps, videos) suggests that the author isn't just making this up. The fact that Alice's cheating affected many students might also be a valid concern beyond just personal grievances.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, if someone has evidence of cheating, they're generally encouraged to report it to the appropriate authorities. The dean would handle the investigation. The author isn't taking matters into their own hands; they're going through the proper channel. However, if the report is biased because of personal issues, that could affect the credibility of the report. But the author claims to have sufficient proof, so the dean would evaluate the evidence objectively.\n\nAnother angle: the author's sister and their own scholarship. The author mentions Alice's condescending remarks. Could this be a case of the author feeling vindictive and using the cheating as an excuse to get back at Alice? It's possible. But the presence of clear evidence of cheating (like the Snapchat with notes during the exam) supports the author's case. If the cheating actually happened, then the report is justified regardless of personal feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together: if the cheating is real and documented, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting it. Even if there's some personal motive, the act of reporting academic dishonesty through proper channels is the right thing to do. The consequences for Alice would be handled by the administration after reviewing the evidence. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
