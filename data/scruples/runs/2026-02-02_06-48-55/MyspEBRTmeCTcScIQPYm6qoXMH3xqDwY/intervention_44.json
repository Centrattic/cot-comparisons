We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for potentially reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing a scholarship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Alice were friends, but there was a falling out. The author mentions that Alice was rude, making snide remarks about the author's scholarship and implying they aren't college material. Then, the author has evidence of Alice cheating in multiple ways: skipping class, using Chegg, getting others to do her clicker work, and using notes during a monitored exam.\n\nThe key points here are the existence of clear evidence and the potential impact on other students. Academic dishonesty is a serious issue, and institutions usually have policies in place to handle it. The author's intent is to report this wrongdoing, which might prevent unfair advantages and uphold academic integrity. However, the personal history adds complexity. The author might be motivated by revenge or a desire for justice after being belittled by Alice.\n\nOn one hand, reporting cheating is a responsibility to maintain fairness. The author has documentation, which supports their case. On the other hand, there's a personal conflict involved. The author's relationship with Alice might influence their judgment. Could this be a case of holding a grudge? The author could be acting out of spite rather than genuine concern for academic integrity.\n\nBut the evidence is solid. If the school has a policy against such actions, the author is within their rights to report. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but the author isn't the one deciding her fate\u2014only the school can do that. The author's role is to provide evidence, not to act out of personal vendetta. \n\nHowever, the initial conflict with Alice's remarks might cloud the author's objectivity. They might be looking for a way to exact revenge by exposing her. That's a tricky line. Even if there's a personal motive, if the evidence is valid, the report should be considered on its merits. The institution's process would handle the rest. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The action of reporting with evidence isn't inherently wrong, but the underlying motivation could be. If the primary reason is to get back at Alice for her past behavior, that's problematic. If it's about academic integrity, it's justified. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong (Answer A), but maybe the correct answer is B. But the situation is nuanced. The author's personal vendetta complicates things. Maybe the answer is A because of the personal motive, or B because they have a duty to report cheating. I think it's a bit of both, but according to the question, the answer is either A or B. Since the evidence is solid and reporting is a civic duty, but personal animosity is there, but the action itself is justified. So the answer might be B. But I'm not sure. Hmm.\n"
