We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they should report a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship. The author has evidence of her academic dishonesty, like using cheat sheets during a proctored exam and paying people to take her classes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Cheating is a serious offense in academic settings. If someone is cheating, it's unfair to others who are following the rules. The author mentions that their friend Alice's actions affected the class curve, lowering others' grades. That's a significant impact on her peers. So, from a moral standpoint, allowing cheating to go unchecked could be seen as enabling unfairness.\n\nThen there's the personal conflict. The author had a falling out with Alice because she was belittling them. This might add a personal motive to the report. The user is concerned about their own feelings of being disrespected and wants to retaliate. But is that a valid reason to report someone? Even if there's a personal grudge, the decision to report should be based on the evidence of cheating, not just personal grievances. However, the author does have concrete evidence, so maybe it's a legitimate action regardless of the personal history.\n\nLegally and institutionally, universities usually have policies against academic dishonesty. If the author has documented proof, reporting it would be in line with those policies. The question is whether the author is using the evidence correctly, not just for revenge. The key here is whether the report is about upholding academic integrity or settling a score.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping if their primary motive is revenge rather than justice. However, the fact that the cheating affected others complicates things. It's not just about the author's own feelings but the broader impact on the class.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author has evidence of serious cheating that harmed others, which is a valid reason to report. The personal conflict is there, but if the report is based on solid evidence and the institution's policies, then it's the right thing to do. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B). But I need to make sure that the primary motivation isn't just revenge. The author mentions they're concerned about others who deserve the scholarship, which adds a selfless motive. So, the decision to report is justified.\n"
