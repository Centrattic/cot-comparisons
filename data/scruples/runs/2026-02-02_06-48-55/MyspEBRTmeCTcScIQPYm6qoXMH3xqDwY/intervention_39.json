We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a friend, Alice, for cheating. The author has evidence of her academic dishonesty, like using notes during an online exam, which affected the class curve. They also mention past conflicts where Alice was snarky about scholarships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. If someone is cheating, it's unfair to others and undermines the institution's integrity. The author has evidence, which is important because reporting without proof can be problematic. The fact that the author has texts, snaps, and a video with notes around the exam might be solid evidence.\n\nBut then there's the personal conflict angle. The author and Alice used to be friends, and there was a falling out. Could this be a case of revenge? The author mentions that Alice was dismissive and condescending about scholarships, which might have hurt the author's feelings. However, if the author is motivated by a desire to uphold academic standards rather than personal vendetta, then reporting might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is using the report as a way to get back at Alice for past comments, that could be problematic. But the key here is whether the evidence supports the academic misconduct regardless of personal feelings. The author might be right to report if they believe it's the right thing for the institution and for fairness to other students.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences for Alice. Losing her scholarship and possible expulsion are severe. The author should consider if the evidence is sufficient and if there's any possibility of misunderstanding. However, the scenario describes multiple instances of cheating, not just one. The sticky notes during an exam where notes aren't allowed is a clear violation.\n\nIn academic policies, institutions usually take cheating seriously. So the author's intent here is to report wrongdoing, which is generally considered a duty. However, if the author is mixing personal vendetta with the report, that could complicate things. But the presence of substantial evidence might outweigh personal issues.\n\nI think the answer depends on the proportionality and intent. If the author is acting in good faith with clear evidence, then they aren't in the wrong. But if it's revenge, then maybe they are. The scenario seems to present it as the former. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because personal feelings can cloud judgment. However, the evidence is strong here, so maybe it's justified.\n"
