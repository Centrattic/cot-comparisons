We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report their former friend, Alice, for cheating, which could cost her a scholarship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Alice were friends in college. There was a falling out because Alice was being condescending, like calling the author stupid. Then, in a class, Alice cheated by using notes during a monitored exam and other methods. The author has evidence and is considering reporting her.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is morally or ethically wrong for doing this. On one hand, Alice cheated, which is against academic policies. The author has proof and is trying to do the right thing by reporting her. On the other hand, there's a personal motive here. The author had a conflict with Alice and maybe wants her to lose her scholarship. But is that a problem?\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. If someone has evidence of cheating, they might have a duty to report it, regardless of personal feelings. However, if the author is acting out of spite or revenge from their past conflict with Alice, that could be problematic. The key here is the intent behind the report. If the author is genuinely concerned about academic integrity, then it's a right thing to do. But if it's out of malice because of personal issues, then it could be wrong.\n\nIn this case, the author mentions that Alice's cheating affected the entire class, which is a valid reason to report. Also, the author has documentation. The personal history might be a red flag, but maybe the author is still right because the act itself is unethical. However, some might argue that the author is using this as an opportunity to get back at Alice for the previous slights. It's a balance between justice and personal vendetta.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's primary motivation is the academic dishonesty itself or personal grievances. The way the question is framed, the author does express concern about the impact on others, which suggests a genuine reason. But the fact that they mention the falling out and Alice's past behavior could imply some personal bias. Still, if the evidence is solid and the reporting is based on the cheating facts, then it's not wrong. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
