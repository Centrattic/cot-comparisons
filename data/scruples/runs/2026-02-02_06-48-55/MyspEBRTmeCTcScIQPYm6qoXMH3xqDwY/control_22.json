We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for considering reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship. The scenario is complex with personal history between the author and Alice.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The author and Alice were friends, but there was a falling out due to Alice's condescending behavior. Alice cheated on an online exam by using sticky notes with notes, which affected the class curve. The author has evidence, including a Snapchat showing her cheating. The question is whether reporting Alice is justified, or if the author is acting out of spite due to past conflicts.\n\nOn one hand, academic dishonesty is a serious issue. Cheating undermines the integrity of the institution and affects other students' grades. The author has concrete evidence here, so reporting it could be a responsible action to uphold academic standards. The fact that Alice's actions impacted 180 students might make it a broader issue beyond just personal grievances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's relationship with Alice might be influencing their decision. They mention that Alice's past behavior towards them was hurtful, and this could be a retaliatory move. The question is whether the author's personal feelings are clouding their judgment. The key here is the intent behind the report. If the author is motivated primarily by revenge for the past slights rather than a genuine concern for academic integrity, then it could be seen as wrong. However, if they're acting based on valid evidence and the impact on other students, it's a more justified action.\n\nThe evidence presented seems substantial (texts, Snapchat, videos), which supports the claim. The author isn't just making accusations without proof. Also, the effect on the class curve is a significant factor, as cheating in a large class can devalue others' efforts. \n\nIt's important to consider the ethical obligations here. Reporting cheating is a civic duty to maintain fairness. However, the personal history adds a layer of complexity. The author needs to ensure that their report is based on factual evidence and not personal vendetta. If they genuinely believe that Alice's actions are unethical and harmful, then reporting is appropriate. But if the primary motive is revenge, then it's problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the key is the author's intent and the validity of the evidence. Since the author has documented proof and the cheating had a significant impact on others, their action might be justified. However, if the report is driven by past grievances rather than a commitment to academic integrity, it could be seen as wrong. The answer hinges on whether the report is a legitimate concern for the institution's standards or an act of retaliation.\n"
