We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. The scenario involves academic dishonesty, so it's a moral and ethical question.\n\nFirst, the author had a falling out with their friend Alice after she made snide comments about the author's scholarship. Alice is described as someone who doesn't take school seriously, skips classes, uses Chegg, pays others to bring her clicker, and cheated on an exam by having notes around her webcam. The author has evidence of her cheating and wants to report her, potentially leading to the loss of her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. On one hand, cheating is a serious offense, and institutions usually have policies against it. Reporting academic dishonesty is generally seen as a responsible action to maintain academic integrity. The author has evidence, so they might be justified in reporting.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the personal conflict between the author and Alice. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending. Could this be a case of revenge? The author mentions that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, which is a valid concern for other students. However, if the primary motivation is revenge for past comments, that could be problematic.\n\nBut the author states that the evidence is there, and the cheating did affect others. Academic institutions often encourage reporting such incidents regardless of personal feelings. Even if there's a personal grudge, if there's valid evidence, the right course of action is to report it. The author isn't just acting out of spite but has legitimate concerns about fairness.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the author is using this as a way to get back at Alice for the previous slights. The line between doing the right thing and acting out of vengeance can be thin. If the author's main intent is to retaliate, that could make their actions ethically questionable. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they're reporting based on valid evidence and the institution's policies, then they might not be in the wrong. The key is intent and whether the action is justified.\n\nIn academic settings, the duty to report cheating is often considered a responsibility to uphold standards, even if there's a personal conflict. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting, especially with evidence. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be cautious because if the main motive is revenge, that could tip the balance. However, the scenario doesn't explicitly state that the author is acting out of malice but rather because they have evidence and the cheating harmed others. So, the answer is probably B.\n"
