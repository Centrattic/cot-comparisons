We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author used to be friends with Alice but had a falling out. Alice was a friend who was very dismissive and tried to belittle the author. Now, the author has evidence of Alice cheating, including in an exam that affected the class curve. They have documentation like texts and a Snapchat that show her cheating.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they want to report her. On one hand, there's a personal history of dislike and being insulted. But the main issue is academic dishonesty. The question is whether the author is justified in reporting Alice despite the personal history.\n\nIn academic settings, cheating is a serious offense. If there's solid evidence, institutions usually encourage reporting misconduct to maintain integrity. The fact that the author has multiple types of proof (texts, Snapchat, etc.) strengthens their case. The personal conflict might be a red flag, but if the evidence is there, it's a matter of upholding academic standards.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for personal vendetta. The author's motivation might be partly due to past arguments. But if the evidence is sufficient, the institution can handle the case without the author's personal grievances influencing the outcome. The key is whether the evidence is credible and the process is followed correctly.\n\nIn most cases, institutions have procedures for reporting academic dishonesty. If the author reports through the proper channels, they might be doing the right thing. The possible consequences for Alice are severe, but if she did cheat, it's a matter of accountability.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if the intent is to report genuine misconduct. But there's a risk of personal bias. However, since they have evidence, it's a judgment call. The main factors are the existence of concrete evidence and adherence to the reporting process. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're acting on valid evidence, even if there's a personal conflict.\n"
