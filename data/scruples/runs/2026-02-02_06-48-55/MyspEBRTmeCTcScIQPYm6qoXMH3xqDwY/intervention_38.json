We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author mentions that Alice cheated in multiple ways: skipping classes, using Chegg for homework, paying others for clicker points, and having notes during a proctored exam. The author has documentation, like screenshots and videos. The main question is whether the author is justified in reporting Alice.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious academic offense. The author is trying to uphold academic integrity, which is important. The exam incident affected the whole class's curve, which is a significant issue. The author might be doing the right thing to ensure fairness for all students.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a falling out with Alice. They mention that Alice used to call them stupid and try to one-up them. There's a potential for personal vendetta here. The author might be using the cheating as an excuse to get back at Alice for personal reasons. The text mentions that the author has a history of conflict with Alice, which could influence their decision.\n\nHowever, the author does have substantial evidence. Even if there was a past conflict, the act of cheating is separate. The author is presenting evidence, not just making accusations. The fact that they have texts, Snapchat messages, and videos suggests they're not acting on a whim but have proof.\n\nBut the key point is intent. If the author is genuinely trying to report a violation of academic rules, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if their primary motivation is revenge due to the past conflict, then it could be considered wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that Alice's cheating affected everyone else, so there's a public interest in reporting it. If the author didn't report it, others might suffer. But the personal history could cloud judgment. Still, the presence of evidence is crucial here. The university has procedures for reporting academic dishonesty, so following those procedures is legitimate.\n\nTherefore, even though there's a personal conflict, the author is acting within the university's policies by providing evidence of cheating. The right to report academic misconduct is usually available to anyone who has evidence, regardless of personal relationships. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the author is upholding academic integrity with evidence, even if there's a personal motive.\n"
