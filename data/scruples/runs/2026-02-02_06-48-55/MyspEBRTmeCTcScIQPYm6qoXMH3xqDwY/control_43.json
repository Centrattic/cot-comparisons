We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting Alice for cheating, which could cost her a scholarship. The scenario involves a past friendship where the author felt belittled by Alice, who also cheated in a class.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They have evidence of academic dishonesty, including a Snapchat with notes during an exam. The key point is whether they're justified in reporting her. Cheating is a serious offense, and universities usually have policies against it. The author's intent is to report based on concrete evidence, which is a valid action to uphold academic integrity. However, the author also mentions personal conflict with Alice, like being called stupid. There's a risk that personal grievances might be influencing the report. \n\nBut the evidence they have is substantial. The exam incident affected the class curve, and there are witnesses (the 180 students). The author isn't just acting out of spite; they have proof. Even though there was a falling out, the decision to report is based on academic misconduct, not just personal issues. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but the author's responsibility to report wrongdoing is also important. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is using this as a way to get back at Alice for past hurts. However, the presence of clear evidence and the impact on other students might outweigh personal feelings. Academic institutions typically encourage reporting fraud to maintain fairness. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
