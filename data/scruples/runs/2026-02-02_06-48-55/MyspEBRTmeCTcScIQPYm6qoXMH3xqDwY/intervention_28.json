We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting their friend Alice for cheating. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and Alice were friends until a falling out. Alice used to subtly call the author stupid and undermine them. The key incident mentioned is when Alice made a comment about the author's scholarship, implying they aren't college material. Then, the author talks about Alice's academic dishonesty: skipping classes, using Chegg for homework, paying people to use her clicker, and during an online exam, using sticky notes with notes to get a high score. The author has evidence like texts, Snapchat, and a video showing her cheating. The author is considering reporting Alice to the dean to get her scholarship revoked, credits removed, and maybe expelled.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Alice's cheating is serious. She's affecting others by ruining the curve, and she's using methods that don't reflect her actual knowledge. The author has evidence and there's a duty to report cheating to maintain academic integrity. The university's policies would likely support reporting such behavior because cheating is a violation of academic standards.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the personal aspect. The author had a falling out with Alice. Could there be a motive of revenge here? The author mentions that Alice used to belittle them, so maybe the author is acting out of spite. However, the evidence is there, and even if there's personal animosity, if the evidence is valid, the university would handle the reporting. The author isn't the one making the decision; they're just presenting the facts to the authorities.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be overstepping if they're trying to punish Alice beyond what the institution deems appropriate. But the university's process is supposed to determine that. The author's role is to report the misconduct, not to decide the punishment. So, as long as the report is based on factual evidence and not malicious intent, it's their responsibility to report.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author is using the cheating as a way to get back at Alice for the previous comments. That could be a problem. However, the existence of concrete evidence of cheating is separate from the personal conflict. Even if there's a personal vendetta, if the cheating is real, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting it. The university would investigate and decide if the report is valid.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Alice's actions affected others (the curve for 180 students). So there's a broader impact, which strengthens the case for reporting. Academic dishonesty isn't just a personal issue; it affects the integrity of the academic environment.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is probably not in the wrong. They have a duty to report cheating when they have evidence, even if there's a personal history. However, if the author is solely motivated by revenge, that could be problematic. But the presence of clear evidence and the impact on others suggests that the report is justified, regardless of personal feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
