We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a former friend, Alice, who they believe is cheating. The author has evidence and is considering reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and possible expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that Alice cheated in multiple ways: using Chegg for homework, skipping classes and using someone else's clicker, and having notes during an online exam. They have documentation like texts and snaps. The author is conflicted because they had a past friendship but now want to report her due to academic dishonesty affecting others.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider ethical and academic integrity aspects. Cheating is against most academic policies, and reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing. However, the author's motive might be influenced by personal conflict. They mention a falling out where Alice was condescending. Could that be a bias? But the evidence is there, and the author isn't just acting out of spite; they have proof of actions that harmed others.\n\nOn the other hand, even with evidence, the author's intent might be partially driven by their past issues with Alice. But if the school's policy allows reporting, then the author is following the correct procedure. The key is whether the action is justified despite the personal history. Since the author has legitimate evidence and the cheating affected others, it's a duty to report to uphold academic standards. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that personal vendettas could skew judgment, but the presence of clear evidence and intent to protect academic integrity tips it towards B.\n"
