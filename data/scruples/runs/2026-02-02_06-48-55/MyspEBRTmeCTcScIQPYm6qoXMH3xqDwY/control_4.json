We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially reporting Alice for cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context. The author used to be friends with Alice but had a falling out because Alice was being condescending. Now, the author has evidence that Alice cheated in a class, like using notes during a monitored exam. The author is considering reporting her, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and other penalties.\n\nSo, the key points here are about academic dishonesty. Cheating in exams is a serious academic offense, and if the author has documentation, reporting it could be their duty as a student. But there's also the personal history between them\u2014they had a conflict before. Could this be revenge?\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. Legally and ethically, if someone is caught cheating, reporting them is usually the right thing. However, if the report is motivated by personal vendetta rather than concern for academic integrity, that complicates things. The author mentions having text messages, snaps, and videos as evidence. If the evidence is solid, then reporting might be justified.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of due process. The university has procedures for handling academic dishonesty. The author should go through the proper channels. If they do that, it's within their rights. However, if they are acting out of spite from their prior conflict, some might argue it's not ethical. But the line between personal feelings and the right to report misconduct is blurry.\n\nAnother angle: the author claims Alice's actions affected the entire class by ruining the curve. That's a valid reason to report the cheating because it's not just about Alice's grades but the fairness for others. The author might feel that by not reporting, they're letting someone else take advantage of the system, which is unfair to their peers.\n\nHowever, there's also the potential for the report to be based on prior conflict. If Alice's scholarship is lost, it's a severe consequence. The author must weigh the evidence and ensure that their actions are not retaliatory. If they have sufficient evidence and genuinely believe the integrity of the academic system is compromised, then it's a moral duty to report. But if it's personal revenge, that's different.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the motivation and the validity of the evidence. Since the user provided that the author has documentation, and the cheating affected others, the author is likely justified. But if the personal conflict is the main driver, it complicates it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the evidence is solid and the report is made through proper channels, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if it's a personal vendetta, they might be. The scenario doesn't clearly state the motivation is purely revenge, so leaning towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
