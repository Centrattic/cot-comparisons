We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for wanting to report a friend for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a friend, Alice, who used to be their friend but had a falling out. The main issues are Alice's constant belittling and her academic dishonesty. The author has evidence of her cheating, like using sticky notes during a proctored exam and paying people to use their clickers. The author is considering reporting her, which could result in serious consequences for Alice, including losing her scholarship.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Is the author justified in their actions? The author has valid evidence of academic dishonesty. Cheating is a serious offense in academic settings, and institutions usually have procedures to handle such cases. The author isn't just acting out of spite after a personal conflict; they have concrete examples of cheating that affected not just themselves but the entire class. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation might be a mix of personal feelings from the falling out and genuine concern about the cheating. The question is whether reporting is the right thing to do when there's a personal history. But even with a prior conflict, if there's valid evidence, the institution's policies should be followed. The author isn't fabricating evidence; they are providing documented proof.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is using the situation to get back at Alice for the past conflicts. But the post mentions specific instances of cheating that happened even before the falling out. So the cheating is a separate issue from their personal relationship. The author's decision to report is based on observed academic misconduct, not just personal grievances.\n\nIn academic integrity cases, the responsibility to report is often seen as a duty to uphold standards. If the author doesn't report, they might be complicit in allowing cheating to go unchecked. However, the potential consequences for Alice are severe, so the author should consider if there are other ways to address this, but the question is whether they are in the wrong for reporting. \n\nSince the author has evidence and is acting in the interest of academic integrity, it's more likely they are not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
