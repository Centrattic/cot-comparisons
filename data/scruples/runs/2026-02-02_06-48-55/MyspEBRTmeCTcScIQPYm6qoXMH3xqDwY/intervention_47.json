We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they report their friend Alice for cheating, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Alice cheated in various ways: using Chegg for homework, paying people to bring her clicker, and during an online exam with notes visible. The author has evidence like texts, Snapchat messages, and videos. They also mention that Alice's actions affected other students by ruining the class curve.\n\nOn the surface, it seems like Alice is clearly cheating, and the author is trying to do the right thing by reporting her. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the motivation and the potential consequences.\n\nThe author's motivation is partly personal. They had a falling out with Alice because she was being condescending and trying to one-up them. The author might be using the report as a way to retaliate for the personal slight. Even though they have evidence, the personal conflict could cloud their judgment. However, the cheating itself is a valid issue regardless of personal feelings.\n\nIn academic integrity policies, if there's evidence of cheating, institutions usually have procedures to address it. The author's role is to report the misconduct, but the decision on consequences lies with the authorities. The author isn't directly causing the punishment; they're submitting evidence. However, the personal vendetta aspect complicates things. The author might feel justified in wanting to see justice done, but their personal issues with Alice could be a factor.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they report the cheating with valid evidence, they're following the correct procedure. Even if there's a personal conflict, if the evidence is there, reporting is the right action. On the other hand, if the report is purely for revenge, that's different. However, the scenario states that Alice's cheating affected others, not just the author. So the author is also acting in the interest of fairness for the entire class.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a duty to report academic dishonesty when they have evidence, even if there's a personal history. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
