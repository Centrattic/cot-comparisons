We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting someone else for cheating. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend, Alice, who used to be their friend but then they had a falling out. The conflict here is about the author gathering evidence of Alice's cheating, including her putting notes around her computer during an exam, which affected the class curve. The author has documentation like texts and a Snapchat. They're considering reporting her to the dean, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and maybe expulsion.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So, the key points to consider are: Did Alice actually cheat? The author says they have proof. If Alice did cheat, then reporting her is a matter of academic integrity. However, there's a personal element here\u2014there was a past friendship and a falling out. The author might have a motive beyond just upholding academic standards, like revenge or personal spite.\n\nIn academic settings, institutions usually have procedures for reporting cheating. The author's intention to report based on solid evidence might be justified if they're following the correct channels. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the report is made with malicious intent, like to get back at Alice for previous slights, then it's not just about the cheating anymore. But if the author is genuinely concerned about academic honesty and the impact on the class, then it's a matter of doing the right thing.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions Alice's behavior of skipping class and using Chegg. But the main issue here is the exam cheating. The author has evidence of that specific incident. Reporting that could be seen as a responsible action. However, the potential consequences for Alice are severe, so the author should consider whether the evidence is irrefutable and whether the intent is purely to uphold integrity without personal vendetta.\n\nThe key here is the motive. If the author's primary motive is to retaliate against Alice for her past behavior (mocking the author's scholarship), then the report might be considered vindictive. However, if the author is acting in the interest of academic integrity and the fairness for other students, then it's justified. The line between the two can be blurry here. Since the author has documentation and is following the proper channels (reporting to the dean), they might not be in the wrong. But if their actions are driven by personal grudges, then they are in the wrong. The question is whether the answer hinges on the motive or the action itself.\n\nIn academic policies, institutions usually encourage reporting cheating regardless of the reporter's personal feelings. So the act of reporting based on valid evidence is not in itself wrong. However, the ethical aspect might depend on the intent. Since the author mentions the impact on the class and the fairness, it's possible they have valid reasons beyond personal spite. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if the report is based on actual cheating and proper procedures are followed. But if the report is for personal reasons, then A (in the wrong). The scenario doesn't give enough to determine the motive definitively, but the presence of evidence and the impact on others suggests a valid reason. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
