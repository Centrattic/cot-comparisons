We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a friend, Alice, who they had a falling out with. Alice was known to skip classes and cheat, like using Chegg for homework, getting others to do her clicker for attendance, and then in an online exam, she used sticky notes with notes during a proctored test. The author has evidence like texts and screenshots. They're considering reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and other consequences. The author is worried about whether they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) for doing this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Alice's cheating behavior, the evidence the author has, and the potential consequences for Alice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting.\n\nFirst, academic dishonesty is generally considered unethical and against university policies. If Alice did cheat, then reporting it is usually seen as the right thing to do. However, there's the personal aspect here. The author previously had a conflict with Alice, who was being disrespectful and trying to one-up them. There's a possible motive of revenge here. The user might be concerned that the author is using this as an opportunity to get back at Alice for past slights.\n\nThe user's dilemma is whether their personal grievances justify the report. Even if Alice did cheat, if the author's primary motive is revenge because of their past conflict, that could make the situation ethically murky. However, the author does mention having substantial evidence, which is necessary for a valid report. Without evidence, it would be a problem, but since they have proof, the report is based on real misconduct.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. The author notes that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, so there's a broader harm beyond just personal issues. This supports the justification for reporting. However, the personal vendetta aspect complicates things. If the author is more motivated by personal issues than the academic integrity, it's a gray area.\n\nBut, in academic settings, institutions typically encourage reporting dishonesty regardless of personal feelings. The key is whether the report is based on factual evidence rather than malice. The author has the evidence, and even if they're upset, they have a duty to report if they believe someone is cheating. However, there's a risk that the dean might see the report as biased due to the prior conflict, so the author should consider that before sending it.\n\nIn ethical terms, the right to report academic dishonesty is important for maintaining integrity. However, the method and motive matter. If the author is using the evidence properly and not exaggerating, then it's justified. But if their primary intent is revenge, it's a different story. The answer hinges on whether the report is in good faith. The author has a valid reason (academic cheating affecting others) and the evidence, so they might not be in the wrong. However, the personal motive could be a point against them. But since the action is still based on legitimate misconduct, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with a note about considering their motives.\n"
