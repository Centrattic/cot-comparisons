We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. The scenario is that Alice used to be friends with the author but had a falling out. The author has evidence of Alice's academic dishonesty, like using Chegg, skipping classes, and cheating during an online exam. The author is thinking about reporting her to the dean, which could lead to losing her scholarship and other penalties.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author has a valid reason to report. Academic dishonesty is taken seriously in colleges. Cheating on exams, using unauthorized materials, and paying someone to attend classes are all serious offenses. The author has documentation like texts, Snapchat messages, and videos. That seems like solid evidence. \n\nBut there's a personal angle here. The author and Alice had a falling out, so there might be a conflict of interest. Could this be a personal vendetta? The author mentions that Alice was always trying to belittle them, which might make them want revenge. However, the evidence presented seems genuine. The author isn't just reporting out of spite; there's actual cheating involved that affected the class curve. \n\nAlso, the impact of Alice's actions isn't just personal. The class average was 72%, and she got a 93%, which ruined the curve for everyone. So it's not just about Alice's own cheating but also the effect on other students. The author is concerned about fairness and the integrity of the academic system. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overstepping if they didn't go through the proper channels first. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for considering the report. If the evidence is there, and the rules are being broken, then reporting is the right thing. However, the personal history might influence their judgment. But the main issue here is the academic dishonesty, not the past friendship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid evidence of cheating that affects others, and they're acting in the interest of academic integrity. The personal conflict is there, but the core issue is about reporting legitimate misconduct. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
