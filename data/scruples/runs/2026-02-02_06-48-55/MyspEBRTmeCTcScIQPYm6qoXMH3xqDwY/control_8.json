We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for reporting someone else for cheating, which could lead to the other person losing their scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend, Alice, who they eventually had a falling out with. Alice used to subtly call the author stupid and undermine them. Then there's the part about the scholarship. The author's sister got a bigger scholarship, and Alice made a comment implying the author wasn't college material. The author feels that Alice wasn't taking school seriously, skipping classes, using others to do her work, and cheating on an exam. The author has evidence and is considering reporting her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Reporting someone for cheating is generally considered a responsible action because it upholds academic integrity. However, motivations can matter. The author mentions a history of conflict with Alice, including being called stupid and one-upped. There's a possibility of personal vendetta here. The author might be using the scholarship comment as a catalyst to report her, which could be seen as retaliating due to past tensions.\n\nBut on the other hand, the cheating incident is a concrete case of academic dishonesty that affects others. The exam cheating affected the class curve, which is a legitimate issue. The author has evidence, so reporting it might be seen as doing the right thing regardless of past issues. However, the personal history might cloud the judgment of whether the report is purely for the right reasons.\n\nIn academic policies, the key is whether there's sufficient evidence and whether the report is made in good faith. If the author is reporting solely to get back at Alice for the past comments, that could be problematic. But if the report is genuinely about stopping cheating that harms others, it's justified. The line here is thin. The author's frustration with Alice's behavior could be a mix of both personal and ethical reasons. \n\nI need to consider if the author's past interactions with Alice give them a biased perspective. For example, the author might have a negative opinion of Alice, making it more likely they overestimate her cheating. However, the evidence they have (texts, snaps, etc.) is solid. If the evidence is there, then the report is valid regardless of personal feelings. But if the report is primarily driven by a desire for revenge, then it's wrong.\n\nSo, the key factors are: 1) The existence of credible evidence of cheating. 2) The impact of the cheating on others. 3) The author's motivations. If the author is acting on valid evidence and in the interest of academic integrity, they're justified. If it's mainly revenge, then they're in the wrong. The scenario mentions that the author has documentation, so the evidence part checks out. However, the personal history with Alice might influence their decision. But the cheating incident itself is a separate issue. Even if they have a grudge, if Alice actually cheated, the report is appropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting based on a personal conflict. But in academic settings, reporting cheating is expected, even if there's a personal history, as long as the evidence is there. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the author's primary motivation is revenge, then it's A. But the question is whether they are in the wrong regardless of motivation. Legally and ethically, if the report is accurate and based on evidence, the author isn't in the wrong, even if there's some personal motive. But if they knew Alice wasn't cheating and just wanted to get her in trouble, that's different. Here, the author has evidence, so it's more about the right to report. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
