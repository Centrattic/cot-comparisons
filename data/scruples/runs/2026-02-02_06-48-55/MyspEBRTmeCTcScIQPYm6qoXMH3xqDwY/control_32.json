We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author used to be friends with Alice, but they had a falling out because Alice was being condescending. Now, Alice is cheating in classes, including using notes during a monitored exam, which affected the class curve. The author has evidence and wants to report her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong to do this. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the key points here.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious academic offense. The author has documented proof, which is crucial. The exam in question was monitored, and using notes would result in a zero. Alice's actions not only hurt herself but also affected other students by lowering the curve. The author's motivation might be partly vindictive because of the past conflict, but the primary issue is the academic dishonesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a personal grievance with Alice. There's a risk that the report could be seen as a personal vendetta. However, the presence of substantial evidence and the fact that the cheating impacted others might justify the report regardless of personal feelings. Also, if the university has a policy where students can report academic misconduct, the author is within their rights to do so if they have valid evidence.\n\nI need to consider the ethical angle here. Is it right to report someone for cheating, even if there's a personal conflict? Generally, academic integrity policies are in place for a reason. Reporting cheating is a responsibility of students to maintain fairness. However, if the report is motivated by personal vendetta without proper cause, that could be problematic. In this case, the author has evidence and the cheating did affect others. So, even with the history, the action is justified.\n\nAnother point is the potential consequences for Alice. Losing her scholarship and facing expulsion is severe. But if the evidence is solid, the university would handle that. The author's role is to report the misconduct, not to decide the punishment. The university will assess the evidence and determine the appropriate action.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're upholding academic standards and providing evidence that the university needs to address. The personal conflict might cloud their judgment a bit, but given the facts, the report is justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
