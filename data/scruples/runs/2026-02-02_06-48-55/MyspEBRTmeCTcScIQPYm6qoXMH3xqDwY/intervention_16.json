We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship. The scenario is complex.\n\nFirst, the author used to be friends with Alice but had a falling out after Alice made snide remarks about the author's scholarship. The author has evidence of Alice's academic dishonesty, including her using notes during an online exam and other cheating behaviors. The author wants to report her, which might have serious consequences for Alice.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking another perspective. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author has a valid reason to report unethical behavior. Cheating is against academic integrity, and reporting it is the right thing to do regardless of personal relationships. The author has evidence, so it's not just a personal vendetta. The cheating affected the entire class, so there's a broader impact beyond just the two individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a conflict with Alice prior to this. It's possible that personal resentment could influence their decision to report. However, the author claims to have substantial proof and is considering the academic institution's policies. The key here is whether the author's primary motivation is justice for the academic violation or revenge for the past slights. If it's the latter, then it's in the wrong. But if the author's main concern is upholding academic standards and the evidence supports that, then they might not be in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because of the prior conflict. But if the author is genuinely concerned about the academic dishonesty and has evidence, then it's a matter of doing the right thing. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but the institution's process would handle that. The author's role is to report suspected violations, not to decide the outcome. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting on evidence of cheating, which is a serious issue, even if there's a personal history involved.\n"
