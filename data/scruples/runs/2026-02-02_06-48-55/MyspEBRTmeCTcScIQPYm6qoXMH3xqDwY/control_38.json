We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author is considering reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating because she used her scholarship inappropriately. They had a falling out, and the author has evidence of her academic dishonesty, like using sticky notes during a monitored exam and paying someone for clickers in class. The author is worried about the aftermath and whether reporting her is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, Alice is cheating, which affects the entire class's curve and is unfair to others. The author has concrete evidence, which is a key point. On the other hand, the author has a personal history with Alice\u2014they were friends and had a conflict where Alice was mean. The question is whether the author's personal feelings are influencing their decision to report, possibly as a form of revenge.\n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The main factors here are the integrity of academic standards versus personal vendettas. If the author is acting purely to uphold academic honesty and has valid evidence, then it's a responsible action. However, if the author is motivated by spite from the previous conflict, it might be seen as vindictive.\n\nThe text mentions that the author's sister got a scholarship and the author's own scholarship is smaller. Alice's comment about not being college material could have stung, and the author might be using this as a way to get back at her. But the author also states that the cheating affected the whole class, so there's a genuine academic misconduct issue. The presence of solid evidence (texts, Snapchat, videos) supports the claim. \n\nIn academic integrity cases, institutions usually encourage reporting misconduct, especially when it affects others. However, the personal history adds a layer of potential bias. The key is whether the author's intent is to protect academic standards or to retaliate. The question is whether the author's personal conflict justifies the report. If the author is using the evidence to correct a wrong that's harming others, it's not their fault. If it's just revenge, then it's wrong. The scenario seems to mix both elements, but the presence of clear evidence and the impact on others might tip it in favor of B. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer would be B if the action is justified despite the personal conflict.\n"
