We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is considering reporting a former friend, Alice, for cheating. The key points here are about academic dishonesty and the potential consequences for Alice's scholarship and education.\n\nFirst, the author mentions Alice's cheating in a monitored exam. She used sticky notes with notes, which was against the rules, and this affected the class curve. The author has evidence like texts, snaps, and videos. Reporting this could lead to Alice losing her scholarship, credits, and maybe expulsion. The question is whether the author is wrong to do this.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious academic violation. If Alice did use unfair means, then the institution has a responsibility to enforce academic integrity. The author has evidence, so reporting it could be the right thing to do to uphold fairness for other students. The author also mentions that Alice's actions affected the entire class, which adds to the importance of addressing the cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has a personal motive because they had a falling out with Alice. They might be seeking revenge for the past insults. But the author's main point is that the cheating itself is a problem, not just personal feelings. The evidence they have is substantial, which supports their case.\n\nHowever, the personal history between the author and Alice might cloud their judgment. But if the report is based on valid evidence and the institution's policies, then it's a legitimate action. The key is whether the author is acting out of spite or genuine concern for academic integrity. The author emphasizes the impact on others and the availability of evidence, which leans towards a justified report.\n\nIn academic ethics, students are encouraged to report cheating when they have evidence. So the author might be in the right. But there's also a need to consider if there's any personal bias. However, the main issue here is the cheating, and the author isn't the one who made the rules; they're reporting a violation. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here.\n"
