We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The scenario is that Alice used to be their friend but there was a falling out because she was belittling them. The author has evidence of her academic dishonesty, including a Snapchat with her notes around the camera during an online exam, which she aced. The author is considering reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship, credits, or expulsion. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Reporting someone for cheating is generally seen as a responsible action because it upholds academic integrity. However, the context here is that the author had a conflict with Alice. There's a risk of bias or personal vendetta, especially since they were previously friends and had a falling out. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, possibly due to this personal conflict influencing their decision.\n\nBut then, the consequences of Alice's cheating affect others. She ruined the curve for a class of 180 students, which directly impacts their grades. The author has solid documentation, so if they report, it's not just an accusation. The question is whether the author's motivation is purely about academic integrity or if there's resentment from the past argument. \n\nIf the author's primary concern is the integrity of the academic process and the unfair advantage Alice had, then reporting might be justified. However, if the author is acting out of spite from the past conflict, that could be problematic. The key here is the intent behind the report. The author mentions that Alice's actions affected others, so maybe it's not just personal. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the author is right that Alice cheated, is it their place to report her? Some might say it's up to the institution to handle such matters, and the author is a fellow student. But others might argue that when there's clear evidence, it's the right thing to do to prevent unfairness. \n\nThe user's perspective is that the author is in the wrong, perhaps because the report could be seen as revenge. But I need to weigh the ethical responsibility to report cheating against the personal history. The presence of strong evidence (texts, Snapchat, videos) supports the report. Also, the scholarship is a significant point\u2014Alice's scholarship might be tied to her academic performance, so cheating could disqualify her. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's intent is genuinely about academic integrity or if it's a way to get back at Alice. The scenario doesn't clearly state the intent. The author does mention the impact on others, which suggests a genuine concern. However, the prior conflict might cloud judgment. \n\nIn academic settings, institutions usually encourage reporting of dishonesty to maintain standards. If the evidence is there, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But given the personal history, it's a bit of a gray area. The key is that if the report is based on solid evidence and not malice, it's a responsible action. However, if it's driven by a desire for revenge, then it's wrong. \n\nSince the author states that they have sufficient proof and that Alice's actions affected many students, the ethical stance might lean towards not being in the wrong. But the risk of personal bias is there. I think the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intent seems to be about fairness, and the evidence supports the report. However, the answer could vary based on the institution's policies and whether they accept third-party reports. If the author is a student, they might be encouraged to report through the proper channels. So, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong if acting in good faith with evidence.\n"
