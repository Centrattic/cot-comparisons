We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend, Alice, who cheated on an online exam. The author has evidence and is considering reporting her, which could lead to her losing her scholarship and maybe even being expelled. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Alice cheated in multiple ways: skipping class, using Chegg for homework, paying others for clicker points, and having notes during a monitored exam. The author has concrete evidence like texts and Snapchat messages. Academic dishonesty is generally taken seriously by institutions, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do, even if it's a friend.\n\nBut there's a personal angle here. The author had a falling out with Alice because she was being condescending. There's a potential for personal vendetta here. The author might be motivated not just by upholding academic integrity but also by wanting to get back at Alice for being rude. That complicates things. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to report cheating which affects everyone in the class, not just the author. The class average was 72%, and Alice's high score of 93% could have skewed the curve, making it harder for others. The author's evidence is solid, so the report could be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the personal conflict between them might influence the author's decision. Even if the evidence is there, the author's previous resentment could be a factor. However, if the report is based on solid proof and the institution's policies, it's their responsibility to report academic misconduct regardless of personal feelings. \n\nThe key points are whether the author has valid evidence and if the report is made in good faith. If the author is genuinely concerned about academic integrity, then it's right. If it's a spiteful act, then it's wrong. The question is whether the author's motivations override the ethical obligation to report cheating. Given the evidence they have and the potential impact on the class, it's possible they're acting in the interest of fairness. But the personal conflict could cloud their judgment. \n\nI think the main factor here is the validity of the evidence and the intent. Since the author has documentation and the cheating affected others, reporting is justified. Even if there's a personal issue, the primary reason here is academic dishonesty. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because the personal history might influence the decision. However, if the report is based on facts and following institutional procedures, it's a responsible action. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
