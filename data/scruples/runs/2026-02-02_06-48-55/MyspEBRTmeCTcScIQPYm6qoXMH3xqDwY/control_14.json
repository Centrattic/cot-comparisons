We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a college student who had a friend named Alice. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending, especially about scholarships. Now, the author has evidence that Alice cheated in a class, which affected the class curve and possibly others. The author is considering reporting her to the dean, which could lead to losing her scholarship, credits, or expulsion. The question is if the author is in the wrong by doing this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Reporting someone for cheating is generally considered the right thing to do because academic dishonesty undermines the institution's integrity. The author has documented proof, which is important. If the evidence is solid, then reporting is a valid action. However, the author's personal history with Alice might influence their judgment. They mention that their friendship ended because of Alice's behavior, so there's a personal vendetta angle. Is the author motivated by a desire for justice or retaliation?\n\nOn one hand, the author is acting on known cheating that harmed others. If Alice's actions affected the class curve, others might also be negatively impacted. Reporting her could protect the academic standards and ensure fairness. On the other hand, if the author is driven by personal resentment, it might be seen as an act of revenge rather than a genuine concern for academic integrity.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences for Alice. If she loses her scholarship, it could have serious financial implications. However, if her cheating is proven, the university might have policies in place to handle such situations. The author's intention is to report with the evidence they have, which they claim is sufficient. \n\nI should also think about the role of the institution. Universities typically encourage reporting of academic misconduct. The author's action aligns with institutional policies if the evidence is correct. But if the author's primary motivation is personal, that could taint the moral standing of their action.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author is genuinely concerned about the academic dishonesty and has the proof, then they might be in the right. But if they're using the evidence as a form of revenge, then it's more questionable. The story mentions that the author's sister's scholarship was bigger, and Alice made a snide comment. This might have fueled the author's decision. However, the key point is that the cheating actually happened and it had a negative impact on the class. \n\nSo, the decision hinges on whether the author's intent is just or vengeful. The author might not be in the wrong if their primary motive is to uphold academic integrity. However, if it's to spite Alice, that's different. The question is whether the act of reporting is morally right regardless of the personal history. Since the author has evidence and the university's policies support such reports, it's likely that the author is justified. But the potential for personal bias exists. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they have evidence of cheating that affects others and are reporting it to the authorities, which is the correct procedure. Even if there's a personal history, the act of reporting based on valid evidence is the right thing to do.\n"
