We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering reporting their former friend, Alice, for cheating. The key points here are whether the author has a valid reason to report her and if their actions would be ethical.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Alice cheated in multiple ways: skipping class, using Chegg, paying someone to use her clicker, and having notes during an online exam. The author has evidence like texts and a Snapchat. The final exam incident affected the class curve, which is a significant issue. Academic dishonesty is usually taken seriously by institutions, so reporting it might be justified.\n\nBut there's more to consider. The author and Alice were friends until a falling out. The author was hurt by Alice's insults about their scholarship. This personal conflict might cloud their judgment. Even if Alice cheated, the author's motivation could be partly revenge for the past conflict. That's a red flag. The ethical question here is whether the report is based on genuine concern for academic integrity or personal vendetta.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using their evidence to harm someone else's academic career. Even with proof, the consequences are severe\u2014loss of scholarship, potential expulsion. The author should consider if they're willing to face the repercussions of their actions. Also, what if the evidence isn't enough? The dean might not act on it, or there could be other factors. The author might be overstepping by taking matters into their own hands instead of letting the proper authorities decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the evidence is solid and the cheating is proven, the university has a responsibility to uphold academic standards. The author might feel a moral obligation to report it to protect other students and maintain fairness. But the line between doing the right thing and seeking revenge is thin here.\n\nSo, the main issue is intent. If the author is driven by a genuine belief in academic honesty and fairness, then maybe not in the wrong. But if it's retaliation for past personal issues, then it's more problematic. The answer hinges on whether the report is ethically motivated or vindictive.\n"
