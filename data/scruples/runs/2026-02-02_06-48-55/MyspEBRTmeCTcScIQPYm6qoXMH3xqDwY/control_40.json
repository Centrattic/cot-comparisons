We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The situation is pretty detailed. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and Alice were friends until the author had enough of Alice's condescending behavior. Alice called the author \"stupid\" and undermined their achievements, especially regarding scholarships. Then there's the academic dishonesty part: Alice skipped classes, used Chegg for homework, paid others to do her clicker assignments, and cheated on a monitored final exam. The author has evidence like texts, Snapchat messages, and videos, including one from right before the exam where she had notes around her.\n\nThe key points here are whether Alice actually cheated and if the author is justified in reporting her. Academic dishonesty is usually a serious issue. If Alice violated the university's policies, the author might be right to report her. However, there's a personal conflict here because they were friends, and the author might be acting out of spite due to the falling out. But the author mentions that their evidence is solid and that Alice's actions affected many students' grades. \n\nThe ethical question is whether the author is using this opportunity for revenge over their personal dispute or genuinely reporting a violation. The author does state that they have sufficient proof and that Alice's actions affected others. If the author's main motivation is to stop academic fraud and they have valid evidence, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if there's a personal vendetta, that complicates things. But the author seems focused on the academic dishonesty and the impact on others, not just personal grievances. \n\nUniversities typically encourage reporting misconduct, so the author might be acting correctly by following proper procedures. Even with a personal history, if the evidence supports the claim, it's their responsibility to report it. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden bias here. The author had a falling out, but the evidence is there. So it's a judgment call between the moral obligation to report cheating versus personal conflict.\n"
