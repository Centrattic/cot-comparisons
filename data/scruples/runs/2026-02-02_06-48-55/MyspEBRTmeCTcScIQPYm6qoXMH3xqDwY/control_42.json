We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is acting wrongly by reporting their friend, Alice, for cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author used to be friends with Alice but had a falling out. Alice was being condescending, calling the author \"not college material\" despite their efforts and ACT score. Then, Alice had a pattern of academic dishonesty: skipping classes, using Chegg for homework, paying people to bring her clicker, and during an online final, she had notes around her. The author has evidence of this cheating, including a Snapchat with the notes visible. The author is considering reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship, credits, or expulsion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are the academic dishonesty and the potential consequences for Alice. The author has concrete evidence. Academic integrity is usually taken seriously in educational institutions, so reporting cheating is generally seen as the right thing to do. However, the author's personal history with Alice includes a falling out and some personal insults. Could that be a motive for the report? That's a concern. The author might be acting out of spite, which could be a problem. But if the cheating is real and the evidence is there, then the report is justified regardless of personal feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, even if there's a personal conflict, reporting based on legitimate proof of cheating is the responsible action. The author isn't just trying to get back at Alice; they have a valid reason to report academic misconduct. The fact that Alice's cheating affected other students' grades (the class average) adds weight to the situation, as it's not just about her own actions but also about fairness to others.\n\nHowever, there's a risk of the author being biased. If the report is driven by the personal conflict rather than the cheating itself, that could be problematic. But the scenario states that the author has evidence and that the cheating is real. So the primary motive here is to address the academic dishonesty, not just to retaliate. \n\nIn academic settings, institutions encourage reporting violations of integrity policies. The author is taking responsibility by coming forward, which is usually considered the right course of action. The possible consequences for Alice are severe, but if the evidence is solid, the institution would handle it appropriately. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for reporting the cheating. The answer should be B.\n"
