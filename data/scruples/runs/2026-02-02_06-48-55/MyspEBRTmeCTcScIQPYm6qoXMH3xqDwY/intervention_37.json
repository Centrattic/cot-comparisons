We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The author has evidence of her academic dishonesty, like using notes during an online exam and paying people to do her clicker. The question is whether the author is justified in reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating in exams is a serious offense in most educational institutions. If the author has concrete evidence, then reporting it might be the right thing to do because it's about upholding academic integrity. However, there's a personal angle here. The author used to be friends with Alice, and there was some conflict where Alice was being condescending. Could this be a case of revenge?\n\nBut the author mentions that Alice's cheating affected the entire class, lowering the curve and potentially giving her an unfair advantage. That's a significant point. Academic institutions usually have policies in place to handle such situations, and if the author has evidence, they might be fulfilling a duty by reporting.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of the author's personal vendetta. The falling out between them might be influencing their decision. Even if there's evidence, is it right to use that evidence for personal reasons rather than purely for the sake of academic integrity? That's a gray area. However, if the author is genuinely concerned about the fairness of the system and the impact on other students, then it's more about justice rather than revenge.\n\nAnother point is the potential consequences for Alice. Losing her scholarship and possible expulsion are severe. The author needs to consider if the punishment fits the crime. But if the evidence is solid, the institution's process should handle that. The author's role is to report, not to decide the punishment.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's primary motivation is to uphold academic standards or to retaliate. The text mentions that the author has documentation and that Alice's actions affected others. So, even if there was a personal conflict, the author is acting based on legitimate concerns about cheating. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
