We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Reporting someone for cheating is generally seen as a responsible action because cheating undermines academic integrity. However, the situation here is complicated by the fact that the writer had a falling out with Alice. There's a personal conflict here\u2014Alice called the writer stupid and undermined them, which might have fueled a desire for revenge. \n\nThe writer has concrete evidence of Alice's cheating: sticky notes during an exam, using Chegg, paying people to click in for class, etc. If the university has clear policies against these actions, then reporting them is the right thing to do. But the writer's motivation might be a mix of moral duty and personal vendetta. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious offense and affects others by lowering the curve. The writer has a responsibility to uphold academic standards. On the other hand, the personal history of conflict could bias the report. The question is whether the personal grudge invalidates the report. \n\nIn academic settings, institutions encourage students to report violations regardless of personal feelings because maintaining integrity is crucial. However, if the report is driven by revenge, it might be seen as unethical. But since the evidence is solid, the institution might still act on it. \n\nSo, the key points are: the existence of clear evidence, the institutional policies against cheating, and the potential for personal bias. If the report is made in good faith, even with personal issues, it might not be the author's fault. But if it's purely for revenge, then yes, they're in the wrong. The scenario doesn't indicate malice, just a desire for justice given the evidence. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to check if the personal vendetta tips the balance.\n"
