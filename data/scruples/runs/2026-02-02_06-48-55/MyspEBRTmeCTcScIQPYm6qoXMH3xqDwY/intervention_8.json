We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report someone for cheating. \n\nFirst, the scenario: there's a girl named Alice who cheated on an exam in a class they shared. The author has evidence, like texts and a Snapchat showing her using notes during a proctored exam. The author is considering reporting her, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nThe author and Alice used to be friends, but there was a falling out because Alice was being disrespectful. Now, the author is conflicted about whether reporting her is the right thing to do. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Cheating is a serious academic offense. The university likely has policies about academic dishonesty. If there's solid evidence, the author's responsibility could be to report it. Alice's actions not only affected her but also the class curve, impacting others. The author mentions they have documentation, which is important for a valid report.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a personal conflict with Alice. Could this be a case of revenge? The author mentions that Alice called them stupid and undermined them. So maybe the author is using the evidence as a way to retaliate. That's a key point. If the motivation is revenge, then it's more about personal vendetta than upholding academic integrity.\n\nBut the author does mention that there's enough evidence and that others are affected. The line between doing the right thing and acting out of spite can be blurry here. If the author's primary motive is to correct a wrong done to the class, then reporting might be justified. However, if it's driven by personal spite from the falling out, it could be seen as in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the intent. If the intent is to uphold academic standards, then they're justified. If it's revenge, then maybe they are wrong. The scenario doesn't clearly state the author's primary motivation, but the fact that they mention the impact on others and have evidence suggests a genuine concern. However, the prior conflict with Alice might cloud their judgment.\n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. But given that the author has evidence and the cheating did affect others, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the decision is influenced by their personal anger towards Alice, then yes, they are in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. The key is intent. The author's reasoning includes both the evidence and the effect on others, but the prior conflict complicates it. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have a duty to report genuine academic fraud. However, if the report is malicious, then A. Since the scenario allows for both interpretations, but the user wants to know if they are in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they have evidence and the cheating affected others, even if there was a personal conflict, the academic integrity aspect might outweigh personal issues. So maybe B is correct. But if the author is acting out of spite, then A. The text doesn't specify the main motivation, but the author does mention others being affected, so maybe B.\n"
