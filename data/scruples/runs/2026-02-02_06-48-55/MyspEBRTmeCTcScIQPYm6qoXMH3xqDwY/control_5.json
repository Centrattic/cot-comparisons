We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong if they report Alice for cheating. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The main issue is academic dishonesty. Alice is allegedly cheating by skipping classes, using paid services, and during an exam where she had notes. The author has evidence, which is important. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious offense in academic settings. It undermines the integrity of the institution and gives an unfair advantage. The author is reporting it, which is their right and a civic duty if they believe it's justified. Plus, Alice's actions affected others by ruining the curve, which adds to the harm.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the personal history between the author and Alice. They had a falling out earlier, and the author might be motivated by a desire for revenge. The question is whether personal animosity is influencing the report. However, the author claims to have solid evidence and that the cheating affected others. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Does the author have sufficient evidence? The answer seems to be yes. 2) Is the action of reporting someone for cheating inherently wrong? No, unless it's a false report. 3) Are there any mitigating factors, like personal vendetta? The author's past conflict with Alice could be a red flag, but if the cheating is real, the report is still valid. \n\nInstitutions usually have processes to handle such reports, so the author's responsibility is to report what they know. The consequence of not reporting might be worse, as it allows cheating to go unchecked. Therefore, even if the author is upset, the right thing is to report if the evidence is there. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
