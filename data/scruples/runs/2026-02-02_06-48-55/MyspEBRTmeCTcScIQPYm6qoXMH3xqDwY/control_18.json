We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author had a falling out with Alice because she was being condescending. The author mentions that Alice cheated in various ways: skipping classes, using Chegg, paying people for clicker points. Then, in an online final exam, Alice used sticky notes with notes, which the system didn't catch. The author has evidence like texts, Snapchat, videos, including one right before the exam with the notes visible. The author is considering sending this to the dean, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and possibly expulsion.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. On one hand, academic dishonesty is a serious issue. Cheating affects the integrity of the system and other students. The author has concrete evidence, which is important. Reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do to uphold academic standards. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a personal motive here. The author and Alice had a conflict. The author might be using this as a way to get back at Alice for the past insults. That could be a point against the author. But the author is also pointing out the broader impact on the class, not just personal vendetta. \n\nBut does the fact that the author had a past conflict with Alice make the reporting unethical? Maybe, but if there's substantial evidence, the institution's responsibility is to enforce policies regardless of personal relationships. However, the author's intent could be questioned. If the main reason is revenge, that's different from doing the right thing. But the author does mention that others could benefit from the scholarship, which suggests a broader concern beyond just getting back at Alice.\n\nAlso, the evidence is solid. The author has the proof, which is necessary for a valid report. Without evidence, it might be a personal vendetta, but with it, it's a legitimate case. \n\nIn academic settings, the expectation is that cheating will be reported when there's evidence. So, even if there's a personal element, the institution's policies should handle it. The author isn't the one punishing Alice; they're just providing evidence for the authorities to decide. \n\nTherefore, while there might be a personal motive, as long as the report is based on factual evidence and follows proper channels, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key here is that the author isn't acting on a whim but has proof and is following the right procedure. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but the dean would assess the evidence and decide. The author's action is to report, not to punish, so it's within their right to do so if they believe it's justified.\n"
