We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they report Alice for cheating, which could make her lose her scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a friend, Alice, who they used to be friends with. There was a falling out because Alice was making snide comments and trying to one-up the author. Then, Alice is described as someone who didn't take school seriously, skipped classes, paid people for clicker points, used Chegg for homework, and cheated on an online final exam. The author has evidence of her cheating, including a Snapchat with notes around her computer. Reporting her could lead to her losing her scholarship, credits, or even expulsion. The author is asking if they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) for doing this.\n\nSo, the key points here are academic dishonesty and the potential consequences. The author has concrete evidence, which is important because false accusations can be bad. Alice's cheating affected others by ruining the curve. The question is whether the author is justified in reporting her, or if this is a case of revenge due to their past friendship and the falling out.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is against academic policies, and the author has evidence. Reporting it would be the right thing to do to uphold academic integrity. The fact that the cheating affected other students adds weight to the argument that it's not just about Alice but also about fairness to others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a motive related to their personal conflict with Alice. The initial falling out was about Alice being condescending, and the author might be using the report as a way to get back at her. However, the existence of solid evidence and the fact that the cheating actually happened might mitigate that. The author isn't just making up a story; they have proof. Also, the impact on the class average and other students supports the necessity of the report.\n\nBut there's a potential for bias here. The author's personal feelings towards Alice might influence their decision. However, if the evidence is clear and the cheating is a real issue, then the report is still valid even if there's some personal motive. The main issue is whether the act itself is wrong, regardless of the reporter's feelings.\n\nIn academic settings, there's usually a process for reporting misconduct. If the evidence is there, the proper channels should be followed. The author isn't directly harming Alice; they're reporting an action that violates school policies. The consequences are a result of the school's investigation, not the author's direct action. So, while the author's motive might be mixed, the act of reporting a clear case of cheating is ethically right.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have evidence of academic misconduct that affects others, and reporting it is a responsible action to maintain academic integrity.\n"
