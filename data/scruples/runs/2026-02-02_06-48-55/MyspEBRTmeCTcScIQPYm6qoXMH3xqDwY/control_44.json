We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is considering reporting their former friend, Alice, for cheating. The key points are that Alice cheated on an online exam by using sticky notes with notes, which affected the class curve. The author has evidence and is thinking of sending it to the dean, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious violation of academic integrity. If Alice did cheat, the author has a responsibility to uphold the standards of their institution. However, the author has a personal history with Alice, including a past friendship and a falling out where Alice was dismissive of the author's abilities. This might introduce bias. The question is whether the author's motivation is purely about academic integrity or if there's a personal vendetta.\n\nThe author mentions that Alice's cheating affected others by ruining the class curve. That's a valid point because cheating can have broader consequences. However, the author's personal conflict with Alice could cloud their judgment. They might be acting out of spite rather than a genuine concern for justice. Even though they have evidence, if their intent is to retaliate for past slights, that complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely concerned about academic dishonesty and the impact on the class, reporting her is the right thing to do. The fact that they have substantial documentation strengthens their case. Institutions usually encourage reporting such violations to maintain fairness. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but she did violate the rules. The author isn't directly harming Alice; they're following the proper channels to report misconduct.\n\nAnother angle is the author's prior relationship. They might feel justified in reporting due to Alice's past behavior, but that doesn't necessarily make it wrong. The key is whether the action is based on factual evidence of cheating rather than personal feelings. Since the author has solid proof, and the cheating affected many students, it's a case of upholding institutional integrity over personal grievances.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's intent is malicious or just a duty to report. The evidence supports the cheating claim, so the author isn't wrong if they act in good faith. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
