We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating, which could cost her the scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both angles. The author has evidence of Alice cheating, which affected the class curve. Academic integrity is important, so reporting it could be justified. But there's also the personal vendetta aspect. The author mentions a falling out with Alice, where she was being condescending. They might be motivated by personal feelings rather than just the academic violation.\n\nHowever, the author has concrete proof. If they report it, they're following the proper channels to address academic dishonesty. On the other hand, if their main motivation is revenge for past slights, that complicates things. The line between doing the right thing and seeking retribution can be thin.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If they have valid evidence and report it through the right procedures, even if there's some personal motive, it's still within their rights. The institution's responsibility is to enforce academic standards, not to weigh the personal reasons of the reporter. So in that sense, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting based on actual evidence of cheating.\n\nHowever, if the author is doing this purely out of spite and not for the sake of academic integrity, that could be problematic. But the scenario states that the author has documentation and that the cheating did affect others. The question is whether the author's actions are justified. Since academic dishonesty is a serious issue, the author isn't in the wrong for using the proper channels to report it, even if there's residual personal feelings involved. The institution should handle the case based on the evidence, not the reporter's motivations.\n"
