We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author used to be friends with Alice. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending, especially about scholarships. The author mentions that Alice cheated in multiple ways: using Chegg, skipping classes, paying people to use her clicker, and in an online exam, she had notes around her computer. The author has proof like texts, Snapchats, and a video. They're considering reporting her to the dean, which could lead to losing the scholarship and expulsion. The author is worried about whether they would be at fault (WIBTA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others and undermines academic integrity. If Alice is indeed cheating, then reporting her might be the right thing to do. But the author is also motivated by personal reasons\u2014Alice was mean and condescending. That might complicate things. Could this be revenge? The author had a falling out with Alice, so there's a personal conflict here.\n\nOn one hand, if Alice is cheating, the institution should be informed regardless of personal feelings. Academic dishonesty affects everyone, as mentioned\u2014the class average was lower because of her actions. The author has concrete evidence, so reporting is a responsible action. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's personal vendetta might influence their judgment. They might be using the cheating as an excuse to get back at someone who was rude to them. That could be problematic because if the report is based on retaliation rather than the actual wrongdoing, it could be seen as unethical. However, if the evidence is solid, the personal motive doesn't necessarily negate the validity of the report. The institution's responsibility is to uphold academic standards.\n\nAlso, considering the impact: if Alice loses her scholarship, it's a significant consequence. The author might be causing her a lot of trouble. But if the university investigates and finds her guilty, then it's a consequence of her actions, not the author's. The author's role is to provide evidence, not to decide the punishment.\n\nAnother angle: the author's own scholarship. Their sister got a bigger one, and they were in a bet. But they have their own scholarship based on ACT scores. Alice's actions affecting the class curve might have a ripple effect on grades, which could impact others' scholarships or opportunities. So, addressing cheating benefits the academic environment as a whole.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: reporting someone for cheating is generally the right thing to do, especially with evidence. Personal conflict might cloud judgment, but if the evidence is there, the report is justified. However, if the report is purely for revenge, that's different. The author's texts show a mix of personal grievance and actual academic misconduct. But the presence of solid evidence supports the report. \n\nIn many academic institutions, students are encouraged to report misconduct regardless of personal feelings. The responsibility to maintain integrity is a collective one. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting if the evidence supports it, even if there's a personal motive. However, if the author is exaggerating or lying, then yes, they'd be wrong. But in this case, the author mentions having documentation, so it's plausible.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the act of reporting academic dishonesty, especially with evidence, is ethically sound even if there's a personal angle. The personal conflict doesn't negate the seriousness of the cheating.\n"
