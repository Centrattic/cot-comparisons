We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author and Alice were friends, but they had a falling out. The author mentions that Alice used to subtly call them stupid and one-up them, especially regarding scholarships. Then, Alice is described as someone who didn't take school seriously, skipped classes, used Chegg, paid others for clickers, and cheated on an online final exam. The author has evidence and wants to report her, which could lead to losing her scholarship, credits, or expulsion.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is it ethical to report someone for cheating? Cheating is generally considered unethical and against academic integrity. The author's motivation here is a bit mixed. They mention that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, which is a valid academic concern. The author also feels that Alice's actions are unfair, especially since she received a full scholarship while the author only got 3k. However, the author's personal grievances with Alice might be influencing their decision.\n\nOn one hand, reporting academic dishonesty is a responsibility because it maintains the integrity of the institution. If Alice cheated, it's important to address it. The author has evidence, so using proper channels to report is appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a potential for personal vendetta here. The author had a falling out with Alice, and the timing of the report after their conflict might cloud the judgment. They might be acting out of spite rather than a genuine concern for academic integrity. The author's mention of feeling one-upped and the desire for Alice to lose her scholarship could be driven by personal feelings rather than the ethical duty to report cheating.\n\nAlso, the aftermath of the report could be severe for Alice, leading to her expulsion. The author should consider if their evidence is sufficient and if they're acting in good faith. The question is whether their personal conflict with Alice justifies the action, even if cheating occurred.\n\nIn academic settings, the institution typically handles such matters. The author's role is to report what they know, but the decision on consequences lies with the institution. If the evidence is solid, then the author is fulfilling a duty. However, if the report is motivated by personal animosity, it could be seen as malicious.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the balance between the ethical duty to report cheating versus personal motivations. If the author's primary motivation is to right a wrong in the academic context, then they're justified. But if it's mainly about revenge for the personal conflict, then it's problematic. The scenario doesn't clearly separate the two, but there are signs of both. However, the presence of concrete evidence and the fact that cheating did harm others (affecting the curve) supports the action. The personal vendetta is a complicating factor, but not necessarily invalidating the report.\n"
