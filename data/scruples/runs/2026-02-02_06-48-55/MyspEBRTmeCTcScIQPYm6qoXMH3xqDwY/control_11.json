We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about whether they should report someone for cheating. The person, Alice, is a former friend who the author now has proof of academic dishonesty. The author wants to report her, which could lead to her losing her scholarship and maybe even getting expelled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is obviously wrong, but the author has a personal history with Alice. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending. Now the author has evidence and wants to report her. The key point here is whether the author's motivation is just to uphold academic integrity or if there's some vindictiveness because of their past conflict. If the author is acting out of spite, maybe they're in the wrong. But if they're doing it because they believe in fairness and want to prevent others from being disadvantaged, maybe it's right.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Alice's cheating affected the entire class. The final exam had a curve, and her high score ruined it for everyone. Academic institutions usually have strict policies against cheating. Providing evidence to the dean is part of the proper process. However, the author might be using this as a way to get back at Alice for previous slights. The question is whether their intent is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely concerned about maintaining academic standards and ensuring fairness, then reporting is the right thing to do. The existence of clear evidence is important here\u2014without it, reporting could be seen as a personal attack. But with solid proof, the author is following the correct procedures.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. The author knows that reporting could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and credits. If Alice is indeed cheating, then she shouldn't be in the program, and others deserve the opportunities. But if the author's main goal is revenge, that could be problematic. However, the narrative doesn't clearly indicate that revenge is the main motive. The author seems to focus on the unfairness to the class and the academic dishonesty.\n\nIn academic settings, there's usually an expectation that students will report violations. So, the author might be doing their duty by coming forward. However, there's also a need to consider if there are other ways to address this, like discussing it with a professor first. But given that the exam is already over and the damage is done, reporting to the dean might be the appropriate step.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors: the author has valid evidence, the cheating affected others, and they want to uphold academic integrity. Even though there's a personal history, their actions seem to be in line with institutional policies. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden bias or ulterior motive here. If the author is just trying to get back at Alice, then A would be correct. But based on the information given, the author's primary concern seems to be the academic dishonesty and its impact on others. So, B is likely the correct answer.\n"
