We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is considering reporting a former friend, Alice, for cheating. The main issue here is that Alice cheated on an online final exam by using notes, which affected the class curve. The author has evidence like texts and a Snapchat showing Alice's cheating. They also mention that Alice has a history of not taking school seriously, skipping classes, and using others to click in for her. The author is worried about their own scholarship but feels justified in reporting Alice to get her scholarship revoked, credits dissolved, or expelled.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, cheating is a serious academic offense, and institutions usually have strict policies against it. Reporting someone for cheating is generally seen as the right thing to do because it maintains academic integrity. If Alice's actions affected the class curve, it's unfair to the other students, so the author has a valid reason to report her. The author has documentation, which is important for a credible report.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation might be part of the issue. They mention a falling out with Alice where she insulted them about their scholarship. There's a potential for personal vendetta here. If the author's main reason is to get back at Alice for the past insults, that could cloud their judgment. But the example given about the exam is a separate incident where cheating clearly occurred, regardless of their personal conflict.\n\nAnother point is the potential consequences. If the report is substantiated, Alice could lose her scholarship and face expulsion. The author is aware of the evidence and the policies, so they're acting within the system. However, if the author is using this as a way to harm Alice because of their past conflict, that could be problematic. But the cheating incident is a separate event, so the report might still be justified even if there's personal history.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Alice's cheating affected others. So, by reporting her, they are protecting the integrity of the academic process for everyone else. That's a public service aspect. However, if the author's primary motivation is revenge, that's a different story. But based on the description, it seems like the author is reporting due to the cheating incident itself, not just the past arguments.\n\nIn terms of academic integrity policies, most schools encourage reporting cheating to prevent unfair advantages. So the author is following the correct procedure here. The key is whether the evidence is sufficient and whether the report is made in good faith. The author has evidence, so they are acting responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a personal conflict involved, the author's action of reporting cheating, which is a serious academic offense with evidence, is likely not in the wrong. The main intent is to uphold academic standards, even if there's a personal grievance. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
