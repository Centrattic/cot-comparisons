We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The situation involves Alice's academic dishonesty, which the author has evidence of. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Reporting someone for cheating is generally seen as the right thing to do because it upholds academic integrity. However, there's a personal angle here. The author had a falling out with Alice, which might make it seem like a personal vendetta. But the user mentions that Alice's actions affected the entire class, not just the author. The scholarship part is also a factor\u2014using academic dishonesty to obtain a scholarship is unethical, and the author believes others could use that opportunity.\n\nNow, the author has concrete evidence, which strengthens their case. They aren't just acting out of spite but have documented proof. The key points are: Alice cheated, it affected others, and the author has valid evidence. Even though there was a prior conflict, the decision here is about whether the author is justified in reporting based on the facts.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is using past grievances to retaliate. But given the significant impact on the class and the scholarship, the author's action could be seen as a responsible choice to maintain fairness. The fact that the author is providing evidence to the dean suggests they are following proper channels, which is important for due process.\n\nIn academic settings, integrity is paramount. Cheating undermines the system and gives an unfair advantage. The author's decision to report could prevent others from facing similar disadvantages. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
