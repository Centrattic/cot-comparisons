We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a girl named Alice who the author used to be friends with. There was a falling out because Alice was being subtly condescending, especially about scholarships. Now, the author has evidence that Alice cheated on an online exam, and they're considering reporting her to the dean, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, Alice's cheating is definitely wrong. She used unfair means to get a good grade, which affects the integrity of the class and the other students. The author has proof, so reporting that might be the right thing to do to uphold academic standards. Plus, the author mentions that this cheating affected the curve for all students, so there's a broader impact beyond just Alice.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's motivation might be influenced by their personal conflict with Alice. The falling out suggests there might be some personal vendetta involved. The author might be using the cheating as a way to get back at Alice for the previous insults and one-upping. That could mean the decision to report isn't purely about justice but also about revenge.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the primary motive is revenge, then that could make the action unethical, even if the act of cheating is wrong. However, if the author is genuinely concerned about academic integrity and the impact on the class, then reporting might be the right thing to do regardless of their personal feelings.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of moral responsibility. Even with a personal conflict, if someone has evidence of a serious wrongdoing, there's an argument that they have a duty to report it. But there's also the idea of letting go of personal grudges and not letting past conflicts cloud judgment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they report Alice solely for revenge, then yes. But if they do it because they believe in upholding academic integrity, then no. The challenge is determining the author's true motivation here. The fact that they mention the impact on others (180 students) and the scholarship suggests they care about fairness. However, the fact that they're holding a past grudge might make them biased. It's possible that the author is conflicted, trying to justify their actions with a higher moral purpose while also seeking revenge. \n\nIn such cases, it's hard to say definitively. The line between doing the right thing and acting out of spite can be thin. If the author's main reason is to correct a wrong and ensure fairness, then they're not in the wrong. If it's primarily about getting back at Alice, then they are. The question is whether the author's actions are driven by justice or revenge. The way the question is phrased, the author seems to present a mix of both, but the fact that they have concrete evidence and are considering the broader impact might lean towards them being in the right. However, the personal history complicates things. \n\nI think the key here is that the author has a responsibility to report the cheating regardless of their personal feelings. Academic integrity is a serious matter, and if there's proof, then reporting it is the ethical choice. The fact that they have a personal conflict doesn't negate their duty to report. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
