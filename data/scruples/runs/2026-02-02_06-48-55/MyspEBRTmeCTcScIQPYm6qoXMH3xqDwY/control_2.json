We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend, Alice, who the author used to be friends with. There was a falling out because Alice was being condescending and maybe even calling the author stupid. Then, there's the issue of Alice cheating in her classes, including using clickers, Chegg, and during an online exam where she had sticky notes with notes. The author has evidence and is considering reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and possible expulsion.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author is considering reporting Alice for academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is generally against university policies, so reporting it is usually the right thing to do. However, the author's motivation here might be a factor. The author mentions that Alice was condescending and had a falling out. Is the author seeking revenge? That could be a problem if the primary motivation is personal vendetta rather than upholding academic integrity.\n\nBut the author also states that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, lowering the grades for all 180 students. That's a significant point. Cheating in an exam can indeed affect the fairness of the course for others. The author has documentation, which is good. Universities typically encourage reporting academic misconduct to maintain standards.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting out of malice or personal spite, then it could be problematic. But if the action is taken because of concerns for academic integrity and the impact on other students, it's more justified. The author also mentions that others could benefit from the scholarship if Alice loses it, which is a valid point about resource allocation.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author's personal conflict with Alice might cloud their judgment. They need to consider if they're reporting purely for ethical reasons or if it's influenced by their past conflict. If it's the latter, that could be seen as wrong. However, if the author genuinely believes Alice's actions are harmful and in violation of policies, then it's a responsible action.\n\nUniversities usually have mechanisms to handle such reports, and encouraging the reporting of misconduct is part of maintaining academic standards. The author has evidence, so they are in a position to report properly. The potential consequences are serious, but if the evidence is solid, the university would handle it as per their policies.\n\nSo, the main factors are the validity of the evidence, the author's intent, and whether the action is in line with institutional policies. Since the author has evidence and the cheating affected others, it's on the side of being right. However, if the author's main motive is personal, that could tip the balance. But given the information, the author seems to have a legitimate reason beyond personal dislike. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
