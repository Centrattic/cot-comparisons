We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is considering reporting a former friend, Alice, for cheating. The author has evidence, like Snapchat messages and notes during an exam. The main question is whether the author is wrong to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author mentions that Alice cheated in multiple ways: using Chegg for homework, skipping classes and having someone else use her clicker, and during an online exam, she had sticky notes with her. The author has concrete evidence from texts and snaps. Also, the cheating affected the class curve, making others' grades relative to hers lower.\n\nNow, the author is considering reporting her to the dean, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and expulsion. The user is asking if the author is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious academic offense. If the school has policies against it, then reporting is a legitimate action. The author might be doing the right thing by upholding academic integrity. Plus, the cheating affected others, so reporting could be seen as protecting the rest of the class.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author has some personal history with Alice. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending about the author's scholarship. Maybe there's some personal motive here. The author might feel vindicated by reporting her, especially after the conflict. However, personal feelings shouldn't necessarily override ethical actions. \n\nThe key points are whether the evidence is valid and if the author is acting in good faith. The author claims to have sufficient proof. If that's true, then the report is justified. The fact that others were affected by her cheating adds weight to the report's necessity.\n\nBut maybe the author is trying to get back at Alice for their past conflict. However, the existence of clear evidence and the impact on others suggest that the report is not just personal retaliation. The author's own integrity and commitment to academic standards might be the driving force here.\n\nSo, considering that, the author is likely not in the wrong. They have evidence, the cheating is significant, and it harmed others. Reporting is the responsible action. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
