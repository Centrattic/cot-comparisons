We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing a scholarship. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Alice were friends, but they had a falling out. The author feels that Alice constantly belittled them and tried to undermine their academic achievements. Alice is accused of cheating in various ways\u2014skipping classes, using Chegg, getting others to do her clicker assignments, and using notes during a proctored online exam. The author has evidence of this cheating and is considering reporting it to the dean, which could have serious consequences for Alice.\n\nNow, the key points here. On one hand, academic integrity is a big deal. If Alice did cheat, then the author is doing the right thing by reporting it. The university has rules against cheating, and it's the responsibility of students to uphold these standards. The author has concrete evidence, which strengthens their case. Also, the cheating affected others by ruining the class curve, so there's a collective impact here.\n\nOn the other hand, the personal history between the author and Alice might cloud their judgment. The author mentions a past conflict where Alice said hurtful things. There's a risk that this could lead to bias or seeking revenge. The author might be using this as a way to get back at Alice for the past insults. However, the user is considering whether the author is in the wrong, so we have to evaluate if the report is justified regardless of personal feelings.\n\nBut here's the thing: if the evidence is solid, then the author is acting in the interest of academic integrity. Even if there's animosity, the university's policies are in place to handle such issues. The right course of action is to report the cheating, and the university's administration should handle the consequences based on the evidence. The author's personal feelings shouldn't invalidate the report if the evidence is there.\n\nAnother angle: the potential consequences for Alice are severe\u2014loss of scholarship, expulsion. The author should be certain of the evidence before proceeding. Since they have documentation (texts, snaps, videos), it seems they are well-prepared. However, there's always a risk of false accusations, but in this case, the author has multiple forms of proof. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're fulfilling their responsibility to maintain academic standards. Even if there's a personal vendetta involved, the act of reporting based on solid evidence is justified. The university's process will determine the outcome, which is fair. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
