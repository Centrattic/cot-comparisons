We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is considering reporting a former friend, Alice, for cheating. The author has evidence of Alice's academic dishonesty, including using cheat sites, having others do her clicker work, and writing notes during an online exam. The author is worried about whether they're in the wrong if they report Alice, which could lead to the loss of her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. On one hand, cheating is a serious academic offense. If Alice did all those things, it's unfair to the other students and the integrity of the institution. The author has evidence and is taking a stand, which could be seen as the right thing to do. But on the other hand, the author had a falling out with Alice before this. There's a potential for personal vendetta here. The author mentions that their friendship ended because Alice was always trying to belittle them. So, there's a question of whether the author is motivated by a genuine desire to uphold academic standards or by a desire for revenge.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the evidence. The author claims to have solid documentation, which is important. If they're reporting based on factual evidence, not just a grudge, then maybe they're justified. However, if the report is driven by personal conflict rather than a commitment to academic integrity, it could be seen as wrong. The fact that the cheating affected other students (the class average was lower because of her high score) suggests that the consequences are broader than just her own actions. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal bias. If the author is using this as an opportunity to get back at someone who wronged them, even if the evidence is there, it might taint their actions. However, if the author is genuinely concerned about the academic integrity and the impact on others, then they might be doing the right thing regardless of past conflicts. \n\nIn academic settings, institutions usually encourage reporting of misconduct to maintain standards. The author has a responsibility to uphold these standards, especially if they have the evidence. But they also need to be careful not to act out of spite. The line between doing the right thing and taking revenge can be thin here. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might depend on whether the author's primary motivation is to report the cheating for the sake of fairness, or to retaliate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the report is based on legitimate concerns and evidence, then maybe not. If it's a personal vendetta, then yes. The original poster's thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the given info. The author does have evidence and the cheating affected others, so maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
