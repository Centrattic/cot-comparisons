We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The scenario is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the author had a falling out with Alice because she was being condescending. Now, the author has evidence that Alice cheated on an exam, which affected the class curve. The author is considering reporting her, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and other consequences. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm, so I need to weigh the ethical aspects here. On one hand, cheating is wrong and affects others. The author has concrete evidence and is trying to uphold academic integrity. On the other hand, there's a personal conflict. The author and Alice had a bad friendship, and the author might have a vendetta. \n\nIs it right to report someone out of spite? The author mentions that Alice's actions hurt the class, so there's a genuine issue. But the timing after their falling out might suggest personal motives. However, the author also states they have enough proof. If it's a legitimate case, then reporting could be the right thing to do. But if the report is based on past grudges, then it's wrong.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's intent is to report for the sake of justice or revenge. The scenario says that the author has sufficient evidence and that Alice's cheating did impact others. In academic settings, cheating is a serious offense, and institutions usually encourage reporting. So, even if there's a personal issue, if the evidence is there, the right action might be to report. But the personal motive complicates it. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is based on valid reasons and evidence, then maybe they aren't wrong. But if it's just revenge, then yes. The answer hinges on that.\n\nIn the given text, the author seems to present the cheating as a real problem affecting others, not just personal dislike. So, despite the past conflict, if the evidence is solid, the author might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
