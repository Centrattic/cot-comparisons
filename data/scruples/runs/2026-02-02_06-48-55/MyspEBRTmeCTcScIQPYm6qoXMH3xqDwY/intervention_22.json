We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The author has evidence of her academic dishonesty, including using notes during an online exam, missing classes, and getting others to do her work. The key points here are the potential consequences for Alice and the author's motivations.\n\nFirst, cheating is a serious academic violation. If Alice did cheat, then reporting her might be the right thing to do from an institutional standpoint. The author has concrete evidence, which is important. But the context is that they had a falling out because Alice was being condescending about the author's scholarship. There's a personal conflict here. The author might be acting out of spite, especially since they were friends and the author mentions Alice made them feel inferior. \n\nOn one hand, the author is upholding academic integrity by reporting the cheating. On the other hand, there's a personal vendetta angle. The question is whether the author's personal issues with Alice justify the report. If the intent is mainly to get back at her for the past comments, then it's more about revenge. However, if the author is genuinely concerned about academic dishonesty affecting the class, it's more about doing the right thing.\n\nThe fact that the author has documentation and the cheating affected other students (ruining the curve) adds weight to the argument that it's a valid report. But the personal history complicates things. It's possible the author is in the right because cheating is harmful, but if the primary motive is personal, maybe they are in the wrong. However, institutions usually encourage reporting regardless of personal feelings. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
