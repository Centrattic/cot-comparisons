We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is considering reporting their former friend, Alice, for cheating. The key points are that Alice cheated in an online exam by having notes visible, which affected other students. The author has evidence and wants to report her, which could result in her losing her scholarship or other penalties. The author mentions that they had a falling out with Alice because she was condescending and belittling them regarding scholarships. Now, the author feels justified in reporting her because of the cheating.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is it wrong for the author to report Alice? Let's consider the ethical and moral aspects. On one hand, cheating is a serious issue in academia. If someone cheats, especially in a way that affects others (like ruining the curve), it's generally considered unethical. Reporting it could be seen as upholding academic integrity. The author has concrete evidence, so they're not just making accusations without proof.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the personal vendetta angle. The author mentions that their friendship with Alice ended because of personal conflicts. Could this be a case of the author seeking revenge for past grievances? If the author is using the evidence of cheating as a way to get back at someone who was mean to them, that complicates the situation. The line between doing the right thing and taking personal revenge can be blurry here.\n\nHowever, the author states that they have documentation and that the cheating did have a real impact on other students. The fact that Alice's actions affected 180 students might suggest that the author's motivation isn't entirely personal. But there's still the question of intent. Even if there's a genuine reason to report her, the author's prior negative relationship could influence their judgment. Is it ethical to use personal grievances as a reason to report someone, even if the report is technically valid?\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences for Alice. Losing a scholarship is a significant penalty. If the author is driven by a desire for retribution, that could make their actions wrong. But if they're genuinely concerned about academic dishonesty and the impact on others, then it's a more justified action. The key is whether the author's primary motivation is to uphold academic standards or to harm someone they had a conflict with.\n\nAlso, the author's own behavior should be considered. Did they themselves adhere to academic standards? The user mentions they study hard, attend classes, etc., but that's not directly relevant unless there are other issues. The main point is about Alice's cheating.\n\nI think the crux is whether the author is acting in the interest of academic integrity or personal revenge. The scenario doesn't provide enough information to conclude that the author is lying about the evidence. Assuming the evidence is real, reporting it is the right thing to do regardless of past conflicts. However, if the author is using the evidence as a cover for revenge, that's a different story. But the text doesn't explicitly say that; the author just states the facts and their feelings.\n\nIn academic settings, institutions usually encourage reporting misconduct. The author having evidence and using it to report could be seen as responsible. The possible downside is that the author might have personal feelings, but unless they fabricated evidence or acted with malicious intent just to harm Alice, it might not be wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering all factors.\n\nSo, based on the information given, if the author is reporting based on genuine concerns about cheating that affected others, they might be in the right. However, if the report is primarily motivated by past grievances, even with valid evidence, it could be seen as wrong. The answer hinges on the primary motivation. Since the author mentions the impact on other students and provides evidence, their primary intent might be to address the cheating, not just to retaliate. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But if the personal vendetta is the main reason, then A (in the wrong). The text is a bit ambiguous here, but the author does present the cheating as a legitimate issue, so leaning towards B.\n"
