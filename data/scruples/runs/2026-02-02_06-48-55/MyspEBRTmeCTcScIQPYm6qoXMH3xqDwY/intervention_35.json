We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was friends with Alice until they had a falling out. The conflict started when Alice was being subtly condescending, especially about scholarships. The author mentions that Alice cheated in multiple ways: skipping class, using Chegg, having someone else take the clicker for her, and then during a monitored exam, she had sticky notes around her computer. The author has evidence like texts and a Snapchat showing her cheating. The question is whether reporting her is wrong.\n\nThe author argues that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, harming other students. They also mention that there are people who deserve the scholarship more. But there's a personal element here too\u2014their past friendship and Alice's previous behavior of making the author feel inadequate. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is unethical and undermines academic integrity. If the author has solid evidence, reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing, holding Alice accountable for her actions. It's important to maintain fair academic standards for everyone. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation might be influenced by their personal conflict. They were already upset with Alice for being condescending and maybe feel vindicated by reporting her. There's a risk of using the situation as a way to get back at Alice for the prior slights. That could cloud their judgment and make the action more about personal revenge than justice. \n\nBut the key point is whether the action is justified regardless of personal feelings. If the evidence is strong and the process is followed correctly, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the report is malicious or without proper grounds, then it would be wrong. \n\nThe author has documentation and multiple examples. If they report it through the proper channels (the dean), it's a legitimate process. But even with evidence, the intent matters. If the main reason is to retaliate, that's a problem. However, if the intent is to report academic dishonesty regardless of personal issues, then it's a responsibility. \n\nSo the dilemma is between personal vendetta and upholding academic standards. The answer depends on whether the author's primary motivation is the cheating itself or seeking revenge for the past interactions.\n"
