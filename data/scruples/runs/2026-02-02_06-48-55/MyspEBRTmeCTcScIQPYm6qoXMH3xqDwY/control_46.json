We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating, which could lead to her losing a scholarship. The scenario involves Alice being a former friend who, according to the author, was dismissive and condescending about the author's academic achievements. Now, the author has evidence of Alice's cheating and is contemplating reporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications here. On one hand, Alice's actions are clearly cheating, which is against academic integrity. Cheating not only gives an unfair advantage to the cheater but also undermines the system for other students. The author has concrete evidence, which is important because false accusations can have serious consequences. The fact that the author has documentation like texts, Snapchat messages, and videos strengthens the case for genuine proof.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation might be a factor. The author mentions a past falling out with Alice, where Alice was condescending. There's a possibility that the author's desire to report Alice is partly driven by personal resentment rather than purely a commitment to academic integrity. However, the author does acknowledge the broader impact of Alice's cheating on the class, which suggests that the decision isn't entirely vindictive.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences for Alice. Losing her scholarship could significantly affect her education and future. But since she cheated, some might argue she doesn't deserve the scholarship. However, the severity of the punishment versus the act is a consideration. The author has the evidence, so if they report, it's a legitimate case. The school's policies on academic dishonesty would typically prioritize fairness and integrity, even if it means a harsher outcome for the student involved.\n\nAlso, the author's role here as a whistleblower. If they don't report, they might be complicit in allowing cheating to go unchecked. But if they do report, they could be seen as a responsible individual upholding academic standards. However, personal history with Alice might cloud the judgment. But since the author has evidence and is willing to present it, it's a more objective case.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the act of cheating is clearly wrong. The author's action in reporting it, provided they have valid reasons and evidence, is generally seen as the right thing to do. The potential negative outcome for Alice is a consequence of her actions. The author isn't the one who gave her the scholarship; that's the institution's decision. The author's responsibility is to uphold the integrity of the academic process.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting Alice. The key points are the presence of evidence, the impact of cheating on others, and the author's commitment to academic integrity despite personal history.\n"
