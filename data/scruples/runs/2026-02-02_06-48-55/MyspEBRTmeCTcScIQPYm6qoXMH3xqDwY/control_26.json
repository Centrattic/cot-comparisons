We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author used to be friends with Alice. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending. Now, Alice is cheating in school\u2014using Chegg, skipping class, paying people to do her clicker points, and then writing notes during an online exam. The author has evidence and is considering reporting her to the dean, which could lead to losing her scholarship and expulsion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about academic dishonesty. Cheating is generally considered unethical, and universities have policies against it. If someone is cheating, others have a responsibility to report it because it affects the integrity of the institution and other students. \n\nBut there's also the personal conflict between the author and Alice. They're not close anymore, and the author might have animosity. Could this be a vendetta? The example given about the scholarship comment where Alice says \"some people just aren't college material\" shows she was dismissive. The author might be acting out of spite. \n\nHowever, the evidence is solid: texts, snaps, videos. The author even has a snapshot of her cheating. The impact is real\u2014her cheating affected 180 students' grades. The author's actions are based on documented proof, not just a grudge. \n\nSo even though there's a personal feud, the act of reporting a student who is clearly cheating is ethically correct. The university has a duty to enforce academic integrity. The author is upholding that by reporting. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
