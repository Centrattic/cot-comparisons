We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author used to be friends with Alice until she started being condescending. The main issue here is academic dishonesty. Alice was skipping classes, using Chegg for homework, hiring people to use her clicker, and during a proctored exam, she had sticky notes with notes visible. The author has evidence like texts and a Snapchat photo showing her cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether reporting her is the right thing to do. On one hand, cheating is against academic integrity policies, and if the author has concrete evidence, reporting her could be seen as doing the right thing to uphold standards. On the other hand, there's a personal motive here: the author feels slighted because Alice was being mean and undermining them. There's a potential that the author is acting out of spite, even if the evidence is valid.\n\nBut the key point is whether the action is justified regardless of personal feelings. If the university has clear policies against cheating and the author is reporting based on those policies, then it's their responsibility. However, if the author's primary motivation is revenge, that's a different angle. The question is about moral culpability, not just legal/academic procedures.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of the personal vendetta aspect. However, the existence of solid evidence and the impact on other students might tip it towards the author being in the right. But if the author is using this as a way to get back at Alice for being rude, then maybe they are in the wrong. But the scenario also mentions that Alice's cheating affected the entire class's curve, so it's not just about personal harm.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the reporting is based on genuine concern for academic integrity or personal vendetta. The original post states that there are people who deserve the scholarships more, which adds another layer of justification. However, the author's past friendship and the hurt feelings might cloud their judgment. But the policies are there to be enforced, regardless of personal relationships. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they are following the rules. But if they are acting out of spite, that's a problem. However, the existence of actual cheating and evidence makes it a valid report. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they are upholding academic standards with evidence. But maybe the personal motivation complicates it. The user's own initial thought was that the author is in the wrong, but perhaps that's not the case. I need to decide based on the balance of these factors.\n"
