We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. The situation is complex because there's a personal history of conflict between the two. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Alice is accused of cheating, which includes using notes during a monitored exam, skipping class, and using others for clicker points. The author has evidence like texts and snaps. Academically, cheating is a serious offense, and if proven, it's usually handled by the school. So reporting it might be the right thing from an academic integrity standpoint.\n\nBut there's a personal angle here. The author mentions a falling out over their friendship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly due to personal vendettas. However, even if there's a motive, if the evidence is solid, the action could be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's main motivation is revenge over the friendship, that could cloud their judgment. The school's policy probably requires reporting suspected cheating regardless of personal feelings. But the author's documentation is thorough, which supports a genuine report. \n\nI need to weigh the academic integrity against potential personal bias. If the evidence is there, the author isn't wrong for reporting. However, if the report is motivated purely by past conflicts, it might be unethical. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong, not necessarily if they should report. The answer hinges on whether the report is a legitimate attempt to uphold academic standards or revenge. The details suggest the author has solid evidence and that the cheating affects others, so the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But some might argue A because of personal history. It's a tough call, but the presence of clear evidence and the impact on the class might make B the right choice.\n"
