We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The situation involves academic dishonesty and potential consequences for Alice's scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. If Alice did cheat, then reporting her might be seen as the right thing to do because it upholds academic integrity. The author has documentation, which makes the case stronger. However, there's a personal aspect here\u2014the author had a falling out with Alice. Could this be a vendetta? The user might be concerned about personal bias influencing the decision to report.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that their friendship had ended due to Alice's behavior towards them. The example given where Alice made a derogatory comment about the author's scholarship might have contributed to the author's decision to take action. But is that a valid reason? If the author's primary motivation is to get back at Alice rather than to uphold academic standards, then it's a different scenario. However, the author is presenting the situation as Alice's cheating affecting the whole class and others who could benefit from the scholarship.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. The exam Alice cheated on affected the class curve, which hurt her peers. Reporting her could prevent such harm in the future. The author has evidence, so from a procedural standpoint, they might be justified in reporting. But there's also the question of whether the author is overstepping by using personal grievances to justify the report.\n\nIn academic institutions, the responsibility to report cheating is usually there for any student, not just those directly affected. So if the author genuinely believes cheating is wrong and wants to prevent it, they might not be in the wrong. However, if there's a personal vendetta, it complicates things. The user's description doesn't clearly show that the author's primary motive is retaliation; it's more about correcting a wrong done to others and preventing further harm.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they're acting in the interest of academic integrity and using the proper channels to report the violation. However, the personal history adds complexity. The key here is whether the author's intent is to do the right thing despite the past conflict or if they're seeking revenge. Since the author presents the situation as Alice's actions affecting the whole class and the scholarship, which others deserve, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. But there's a nuance in personal bias. However, since reporting is generally encouraged, the answer is B.\n"
