We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author is someone who had a falling out with a friend, Alice, after feeling belittled by her comments about scholarships. Alice cheated in multiple ways, including skipping class, using Chegg, and during an online exam where she had notes visible. The author has evidence and wants to report her, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship or being expelled.\n\nOn one hand, academic integrity is important. Cheating is against university policies, so reporting it could be the right thing to do. The author has documentation, which strengthens their case. If Alice's actions affected other students, like the curve, then stopping her cheating might be necessary to maintain fairness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a personal vendetta against Alice. They had a conflict where Alice was undermining them. The author might be motivated by revenge rather than just upholding academic standards. The question is whether personal resentment plays a role here. If the author is acting out of spite rather than a genuine concern for the integrity of the institution, that could be problematic.\n\nThe key here is the motivation. If the author's primary reason is to get back at Alice for the past comments, then it might be a misuse of the reporting system. However, if the author is genuinely concerned about the cheating and its impact on others, then it's a responsible action. The fact that the author mentions that others could have used the scholarship also suggests a level of concern beyond personal issues.\n\nBut the line between justice and revenge can be thin. Even if there's some personal history, if the evidence is clear, the university has a process to handle such reports. The author isn't the one handing out punishment; they're reporting potential misconduct. So maybe the right thing is to report it through the proper channels, regardless of personal feelings. The university can then assess the situation without personal bias.\n\nHowever, if the author is using the reporting as a way to settle a score, that's when it becomes problematic. The question is whether the author is acting in good faith. The original post does mention that there's a history of conflict, but also that the cheating affected others. The author's evidence is solid, which is crucial.\n\nIn academic environments, reporting cheating is usually encouraged to maintain standards. Personal relationships shouldn't deter someone from reporting misconduct, especially when it's documented. So, even if there's a history of conflict, the right action is to report it. The consequences for Alice would be handled by the university, not the author. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
