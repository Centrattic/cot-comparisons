We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating is justified. The author has evidence of her academic dishonesty, like using notes during a monitored exam and other instances of cheating. They also mention that Alice's behavior affected the class curve.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Cheating is generally considered wrong, and academic dishonesty is usually against college policies. If the author has solid proof, reporting her might be the right thing to do because it's about upholding academic integrity. However, there's a personal aspect here: the author had a falling out with Alice. Could this be a case of revenge?\n\nBut wait, the author mentions they no longer have a friendship and that Alice was the one being dismissive and condescending. The author's motivation here seems to be about fairness, not just revenge. They want to prevent others from being negatively impacted by Alice's cheating. The class average was 72%, and Alice's 93% affected the curve. That's a significant impact on other students' grades.\n\nAlso, the author has documentation. If they report with evidence, they might be fulfilling a duty to report misconduct. However, there's a risk that the dean might not act, or that the process could be unfair. But the key point is whether the author is in the wrong by choosing to report based on valid evidence of cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle this through formal channels without personal vendettas. But in this case, the author's posts don't show malice beyond wanting to report the cheating. They mention that others could benefit from the scholarship if Alice loses it, which is a fair point about resource allocation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: reporting academic dishonesty is usually seen as the right action, especially with evidence. The author isn't acting out of malice but to correct a wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
