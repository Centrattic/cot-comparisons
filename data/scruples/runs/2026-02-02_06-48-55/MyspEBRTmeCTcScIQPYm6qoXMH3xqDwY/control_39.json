We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person considering reporting a former friend, Alice, for cheating. The author has evidence and is worried about the fallout for Alice, like losing her scholarship and possible expulsion. They want to know if they'd be in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others and undermines academic integrity. The author mentions that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, making it harder for other students. If the author has solid evidence and the institution has policies against cheating, reporting might be the right thing to do. It's about upholding standards, not just personal vendettas.\n\nBut then, there's the personal relationship angle. They had a falling out because Alice was being condescending. The author might feel vindicated by reporting her, but is the motivation purely about justice or is there some personal spite involved? The question is whether the author's actions are justified despite the personal history.\n\nThe key here is the intent and the evidence. If the author is acting in good faith to report actual cheating, using documented proof, then it's a responsible action. However, if there's a lingering grudge from their past conflict, that could complicate things. But the scenario states that the author has clear evidence and the cheating did affect others. The fact that they mention the effect on the class average and the scholarship adds weight to the public harm aspect.\n\nAlso, academic institutions usually have procedures for handling such reports. The author is following the proper channels by going to the dean. So from a procedural standpoint, they might be doing the right thing. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but if the evidence is there, the institution should handle it according to their policies.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own integrity. If they don't report the cheating, they might be complicit in allowing academic dishonesty to go unchecked. So there's a moral obligation to report if they have the evidence. The question is whether the personal conflict with Alice taints their judgment. But the user presents the information as evidence-based, not just revenge.\n\nIn summary, the author has a duty to report cheating when they have the evidence, especially when it affects others. The personal history might add emotional weight, but the action itself seems justified if done for the right reasons. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
