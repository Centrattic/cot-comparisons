We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. So, first, I need to break down the scenario.\n\nThe author and Alice were friends, but they had a falling out. Alice was known for being dismissive and undermining the author's academic achievements. Now, the author has evidence that Alice cheated on an online exam by using notes in a monitored setting. The author wants to report her to the dean, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship, credits, or expulsion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, the key points here are academic dishonesty and the consequences. Cheating is generally considered unethical and against academic policies. If the author has solid evidence, then reporting might be the right thing to do. However, there's a personal conflict involved here. The author and Alice had a falling out, so there's a potential for bias. But the author is acting based on factual evidence, not just personal dislike. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. Alice's cheating affected the class curve, lowering the average and possibly making it harder for other students. The author mentions that others could have used the scholarship, so there's a public interest in maintaining academic integrity here.\n\nBut then, the author's personal vendetta might cloud their judgment. However, the author claims to have documented proof, which is more than just hearsay. The decision to report should be based on the evidence and the rules, not personal feelings. However, the timing of the report comes after a personal conflict, which might raise questions about the author's motives. \n\nIn academic settings, institutions typically encourage students to report cheating regardless of personal relationships. The main thing is whether the report is based on valid evidence. The author believes they have sufficient proof, so from an institutional standpoint, reporting might be appropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is using this as an opportunity to get back at Alice for past slights. But the presence of concrete evidence and the potential harm to others suggests that it's a legitimate case. \n\nSo, considering both the ethical duty to uphold academic standards and the existence of evidence, the author is likely not in the wrong. However, if the report is motivated by revenge, that could be problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their motives are pure. Since the action is to report based on evidence, even if there's a personal element, the ethical duty to prevent cheating is more important. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
