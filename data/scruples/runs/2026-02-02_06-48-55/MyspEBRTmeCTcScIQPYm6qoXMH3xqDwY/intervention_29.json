We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report someone for cheating, which could lead to losing a scholarship. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a falling out with their friend, Alice, because she was being condescending. Then, they noticed Alice cheating multiple times, like skipping classes, using Chegg, getting others to do her clicker points, and writing notes during an online exam. The author has evidence and wants to report her to the dean. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, cheating is unethical and against academic policies. Reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain integrity. The author might feel that Alice's actions are unfair to others who deserve the scholarship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation might be influenced by personal resentment from the broken friendship. There's a risk that the report is more about personal spite than genuine concern for academic integrity. But the evidence is there, so it's not just a random accusation.\n\nAlso, the consequences for Alice are severe\u2014losing a scholarship, expulsion. The author might be justified if they believe they're upholding rules, but if their primary motivation is revenge, that complicates things. However, the presence of substantial evidence and the impact on the class average might make the report legitimate.\n\nIn academic settings, institutions usually encourage reporting dishonesty. The key is whether the report is based on valid evidence and the institution's procedures. Since the author has documentation, they might be following the right channel. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the personal vendetta aspect is a red flag? But the scenario states the falling out was before the cheating incidents. So maybe the author's decision is more about justice than revenge. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B.\n"
