We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a friend, Alice, who they claim is cheating. The situation is detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, Alice and the author were friends, but there was a falling out. The author feels slighted because Alice made comments about her scholarship, implying the author isn't college material. Then, Alice's academic dishonesty is described\u2014skipping classes, using Chegg, getting others to do clicker points, and cheating on an online exam. The author has evidence and wants to report her, possibly leading to losing her scholarship, expulsion, etc.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI need to consider ethical angles. On one hand, cheating is wrong and undermines academic integrity. If Alice is cheating, the author is doing the right thing by reporting her. But there's a personal vendetta angle here. The author's motivation might be revenge for the falling out and the comments about the scholarship. The question is whether the author's actions are justified despite the personal conflict.\n\nAlso, the author has documentation, which is a plus because they have evidence. The impact on others (the class curve) is mentioned, so it's not just Alice's issue. However, the author's personal grievances might cloud their judgment. Is it right to report someone out of spite? But if the evidence is there and the act is cheating, then it's a moral duty to report regardless of personal feelings.\n\nAnother angle: if the author is using this as retaliation for the friendship ending, that's a problem. But if they genuinely believe in academic integrity and want to prevent cheating, then it's justified. The key is intent. The author's intent seems mixed here. They mention the impact on others but also the personal slights.\n\nIn academic settings, institutions usually have policies against cheating. If the author has evidence, they are within their rights to report. The wrongness would depend on whether the report is motivated by malice or justice. Since the user's own analysis is split, but the author has valid grounds for reporting actual academic dishonesty, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the report is primarily for revenge, then A. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the act of cheating is real and the author has evidence, the action is justified, so B.\n"
