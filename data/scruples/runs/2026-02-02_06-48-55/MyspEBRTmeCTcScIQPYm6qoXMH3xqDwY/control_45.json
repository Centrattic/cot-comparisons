We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The situation involves academic dishonesty, and the author has evidence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Reporting someone for cheating is generally seen as the right thing to do because it maintains academic integrity. Cheating affects everyone else, as mentioned with the curved grades. The author has documentation, which is important for a valid report.\n\nOn the flip side, there's the personal relationship aspect. They were friends, and there was some conflict before the falling out. The author might be seeking revenge for how Alice treated them. That could introduce bias. But the key point is that the report is about academic misconduct, not personal vendettas.\n\nThe potential consequences for Alice are severe\u2014losing her scholarship, possible expulsion. That's a big deal, so the author should make sure their motives are pure. If they're doing it out of spite, it's wrong. But if it's to uphold academic standards, then it's justified.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on their intent. If the report is based on evidence and the proper procedures, then they're not in the wrong. But if it's retaliation, then maybe yes. However, the scenario states that the author has sufficient proof and is following the right channels (reporting to the dean), which is the correct process. The fact that Alice's cheating affected others adds weight to the report's validity.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong here. Their actions are within the bounds of maintaining academic integrity, even if there was a personal conflict. The answer should be B.\n"
