We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether to report a former friend, Alice, for cheating. The author has evidence and is considering sending it to the dean, which could lead to Alice losing her scholarship and facing other penalties.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: Alice cheated in multiple ways, like using Chegg, getting others to take her online class activities, and having notes during a proctored exam. The author has concrete evidence, including screenshots and texts. The author also mentions that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, impacting other students.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting her. Let's break it down. On one hand, cheating is a serious academic violation. Universities typically have policies against academic dishonesty, and reporting it is a civic duty to uphold integrity. The author is acting out of a belief that justice should be served, protecting other students' chances, and ensuring fairness.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the personal aspect. The author had a falling out with Alice, which might suggest some personal vendetta. The author mentions that Alice was condescending and made comments about the author's scholarship, which could be a motive. However, the author states that the decision is based on the evidence of cheating, not personal feelings. Also, the impact on others is a valid concern\u2014cheating harms the academic environment for everyone.\n\nBut does the author have a responsibility to report violations? Generally, yes. If the author knows about cheating and has evidence, reporting it is the right thing to do. However, the context of the relationship might cloud judgment. But in this case, the author seems to present the evidence as clear and the intent as to stop cheating, not to retaliate. The question is whether the author's actions are justified despite the personal history.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author is using this as revenge for the past conflict. But the scenario doesn't show that the author is acting out of spite; the focus is on the academic dishonesty. Also, if the cheater's actions indeed affected others' grades, then reporting is in everyone's interest.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are in line with academic integrity policies. They have evidence, and their motive seems to be about fairness. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But need to be careful about personal vendettas. However, the author's description doesn't indicate malice here. Hence, likely B.\n"
