We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author had a falling out with Alice because she was being condescending. Then, Alice cheated in a class by using clickers, Chegg, and during an online exam. The author has evidence like texts and a Snapchat showing her cheating. They want to report her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and possible expulsion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. On one hand, reporting cheating is a responsibility because it's dishonest and affects others. The author has concrete proof, so they're not just accusing someone without reason. Cheating can ruin the integrity of the class and unfair advantage, which affects the curve and others' grades, as mentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a prior conflict with Alice. Could there be a motive of revenge here? They mention the falling out and that Alice was condescending. But the evidence is there, so even if there's a personal history, the action is based on factual cheating. The author might feel justified in correcting the injustice.\n\nBut maybe the author is taking advantage of the situation because of their previous issues. However, the primary issue here is academic dishonesty. The university has policies against cheating, and reporting it is the right thing to do regardless of personal feelings. The fact that the author has proof makes it a legitimate case.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The right choice is B.\n"
