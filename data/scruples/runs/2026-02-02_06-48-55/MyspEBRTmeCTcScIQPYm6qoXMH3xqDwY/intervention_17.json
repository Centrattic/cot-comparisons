We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting Alice for cheating. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and Alice were friends until a falling out. The author mentions that Alice used to subtly call them stupid and try to one-up them. Then there's the issue with Alice's cheating in classes. The author has evidence, like texts and a Snapchat showing her cheating on an exam. The author is considering reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and expulsion.\n\nNow, the main points to consider: Academic integrity is generally a big deal. Cheating undermines the system and can affect other students, as the author mentions the class average being dragged down. The author has concrete evidence here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, reporting cheating is usually seen as the right thing to do because it maintains fairness. The university has policies against cheating, and if the author has the evidence, they might have a duty to report it. Plus, the author is motivated by seeing the scholarship go to someone who deserves it, not just personal revenge. \n\nBut on the other hand, there's the personal conflict between the author and Alice. They had a falling out where Alice was being disrespectful. Could this be a case of the author acting out of spite? The author might be using the evidence as a way to get back at Alice for past slights. That could complicate things because if the report is driven by personal vendetta rather than genuine concern for academic integrity, it might be seen as wrong.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that others in the class were affected, not just them. The scholarship issue also raises the point about fair allocation of resources. The author isn't just seeking revenge; they're also highlighting that others could benefit from the scholarship. \n\nI need to weigh the intent here. If the author's primary motivation is to correct a wrongdoing (cheating) that affects the entire class and the scholarship system, then it's a justified action. Even if there's some personal conflict, the existence of solid evidence supports the legitimacy of the report. The university's policies are in place to handle such matters, and the author is following the proper channels by going through the dean. \n\nSo, while the personal history adds a layer of complexity, the core issue is about academic dishonesty. The author isn't just acting on a grudge but has valid reasons related to cheating that impacts many people. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
