We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this scenario. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting someone they used to be friends with. The situation involves academic cheating and potential consequences like losing a scholarship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has evidence of Alice's cheating, which affected the class curve. They have documentation, which is good. On the other hand, there's a history of conflict between them. The author mentions that Alice was friends with them and was rude about their scholarship. There's a personal motive here, possibly revenge.\n\nBut, academic integrity is a serious matter. Cheating isn't just about the individual\u2014it affects others and the institution's standards. The author is right to point out that Alice's actions impacted the entire class. The question is whether the author's intent in reporting is justifiable.\n\nThe key point is the author's potential bias. If they're reporting out of spite from the past conflict, that could be a problem. However, if they're acting in the interest of upholding academic standards, then it's a duty. The presence of solid evidence supports their case. But the personal vendetta aspect complicates things. \n\nIn academic policies, reporting cheating is usually encouraged regardless of personal feelings. So even if there's a personal grudge, if the evidence is there, the report might be justified. However, the ethical dilemma is whether the author's motives are pure. But in real terms, the institution would handle the case based on evidence, not the reporter's feelings. \n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the author is acting in the interest of justice despite personal issues. If they have valid evidence, they're not in the wrong. But if the report is solely to get back at Alice, that's a problem. The text mentions the impact on the class, so there's a broader concern, not just revenge. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're reporting academic misconduct properly.\n"
