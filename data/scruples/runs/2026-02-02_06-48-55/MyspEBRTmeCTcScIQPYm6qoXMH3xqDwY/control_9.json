We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a falling out with Alice because she was being condescending. Now, Alice is cheating in her classes, like using notes during an online exam monitored by webcam. The author has proof through texts, snaps, etc. They want to report her, which could take away her scholarship and lead to expulsion.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's right to report someone for cheating. Academic integrity is important. If someone is cheating, it's unfair to others and undermines the educational system. The author has evidence, which strengthens their case. However, there's also personal history\u2014Alice was condescending. Could this be a vendetta?\n\nBut the key points are that Alice's actions affected others (ruined the curve for 180 students) and that there's solid evidence. The consequences for cheating are usually strict. The author's motive might be partly about justice for their peers and the integrity of the institution, not just personal spite. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author is using this as revenge for past slights. But the examples given about Alice's cheating are specific and documented. The potential outcome is that Alice loses her scholarship, which is a significant hit, but if she's cheating, she shouldn't have it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a duty to uphold academic standards, and the evidence supports their claim. It's not just about personal feelings but about the broader impact of cheating. So the answer should be B.\n"
