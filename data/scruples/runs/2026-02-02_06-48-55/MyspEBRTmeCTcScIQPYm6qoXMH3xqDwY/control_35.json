We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for wanting to report Alice for cheating. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author used to be friends with Alice but had a falling out because Alice was being condescending and trying to one-up them. Alice cheated in multiple ways: skipping classes, paying people to use her clicker, using Chegg for homework, and during an online final, she had sticky notes around her screen, which the author has proof of via screenshots or snaps.\n\nThe author is considering reporting Alice to the dean, which could lead to losing her scholarship, academic penalties, etc. The question is whether this is the right thing to do.\n\nSo, the key points are: Alice's academic dishonesty, the impact on others (like the final exam affecting the curve), and the author's personal vendetta due to the past friendship.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious offense. The author has evidence and the act affected other students. Reporting it could be seen as upholding academic integrity. On the other hand, the author has a personal history with Alice, which might suggest a conflict of interest or even revenge. The author's motivation might be partly personal due to the prior conflict.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The ethical consideration here is whether the author's action is justified despite the personal history. If the author is reporting purely on the grounds of academic dishonesty, even if they have a past conflict, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the report is driven by personal spite, that's a different story.\n\nThe post does mention that the author has sufficient documentation, which is good. They also note that the cheating affected others, not just themselves. The author's main argument is that others could use the scholarship and deserve it more if Alice is cheating. That's a valid point about fairness.\n\nBut the potential for personal bias exists. The author might be using the report as retaliation for the previous friendship issues. However, given that there's concrete evidence and the cheating is a real issue, the action might still be justified regardless of the personal history. The university's responsibility is to maintain academic standards, and the author has a duty to report if they have proof.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
