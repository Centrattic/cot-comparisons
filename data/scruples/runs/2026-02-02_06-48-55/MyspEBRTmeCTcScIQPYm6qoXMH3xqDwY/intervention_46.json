We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for reporting their friend, Alice, for cheating. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author and Alice were friends, but they had a falling out after the author felt belittled by Alice. Now, the author has evidence that Alice cheated in an online exam, which affected the class curve. The author is considering reporting her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and other penalties.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Alice's cheating, the author's motivation, and the potential consequences. Let's break this down.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is academically dishonest. If the author has solid evidence, reporting it could be seen as the right thing to do to uphold academic integrity. Especially since Alice's actions affected the entire class. The author isn't just out for revenge here; there's a real issue of unfair advantage that impacted others. So, from a moral standpoint, reporting cheating is generally encouraged.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a prior conflict with Alice. They mention that Alice was condescending and made them feel inadequate. Now that they're no longer friends, the author is using this opportunity to report her. There's a risk that personal grievances might be influencing the decision. This could be seen as using the situation to get back at Alice for the earlier slights. That complicates things because it might be perceived as a vendetta rather than a genuine concern for academic honesty.\n\nBut wait, the author also says they have ample evidence. The example of the Snapchat with notes visible is concrete. The exam was monitored via webcam, so the evidence could be strong. The author isn't just making accusations without proof. That adds weight to their case. Also, the cheating did affect the class curve, which is a broader issue affecting all students.\n\nHowever, the underlying tension between the author and Alice might lead others to question the motivation. If the report is seen as retaliatory, the administration might be cautious. But if the evidence is solid, the administration's duty is to enforce academic integrity regardless of personal relationships.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that Alice didn't take school seriously, skipping classes and using other methods to get good grades. The author has evidence of past cheating, like using Chegg and getting help from the tutoring center. So, this isn't just a one-time incident. The final exam is part of a pattern.\n\nBut does the author have a duty to report all instances of cheating they've observed? Or is it their responsibility to do so? In some institutions, students are encouraged to report academic misconduct to maintain standards. So, ethically, the author might feel obligated to report it.\n\nStill, the personal history complicates things. The author might feel that Alice's past behavior justifies the report, but others might argue that the decision is influenced by their prior conflict. However, if the evidence is clear, the author is acting in the interest of fairness rather than revenge.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a personal conflict, the author has valid evidence of cheating that affects others. The action is about upholding academic standards, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the potential for perceived bias exists. But given the evidence and the impact on the class, the author's action is justified. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
