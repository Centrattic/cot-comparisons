We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether to report a former friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing her scholarship. The user is asking if the author (who is considering reporting) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The author and Alice were friends until a falling out. The author feels that Alice was constantly belittling them, especially regarding scholarships. Alice had a history of skipping class, using Chegg, getting someone to click in for her, and in the final exam, she had sticky notes with notes around her computer, possibly cheating. The author has evidence like texts and a Snapchat that show this.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author is justified in reporting Alice. On one hand, academic dishonesty is a serious issue, and if the author has proof, reporting could be the right thing to do to uphold academic integrity. On the other hand, the author's motivation might be personal\u2014revenge for the past insults or wanting to \"get back\" at Alice for being a poor friend. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because there's a personal vendetta involved. The author might be using the evidence as a way to retaliate after the friendship ended badly. However, if the academic dishonesty is real and the evidence is solid, then reporting it could be a duty to the institution and the other students affected by the curve. \n\nI need to consider if there's a conflict of interest here. The author's personal feelings might cloud their judgment. But if the action is based on solid evidence and the right procedures, then it's a responsible act. However, if the report is primarily driven by personal anger rather than a genuine concern for academic integrity, then it might be wrong. \n\nAlso, the potential consequences for Alice are severe\u2014losing her scholarship, credits dissolved, possible expulsion. The author should ensure that their intent isn't malicious. If they're acting in good faith to prevent cheating, even if they have a history with the person, that's a different matter. \n\nIn many institutions, students are encouraged to report academic misconduct regardless of personal relationships. So the author might be doing the right thing by upholding the standards. But if they're doing it out of spite, that's a different angle. The question is whether the action is wrong regardless of their intent. Some would argue that the intent matters, while others say the action is justified if it's reporting legitimate misconduct. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the report is made in good faith. The scenario says the author has sufficient evidence. If they're acting to maintain academic integrity, then they're not in the wrong. If it's revenge, they might be. However, the author's narrative suggests they feel Alice's cheating affected others, so their motivation includes a sense of justice for the class. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) if the report is based on valid evidence and the institution's policies. Even if there's a personal history, if the action is in line with what's right, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
