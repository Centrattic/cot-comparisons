We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating, which could lead to her losing a scholarship. The main points are about the academic dishonesty and the personal conflict.\n\nFirst, the author has evidence of Alice cheating in an online final exam, including notes on sticky notes and a Snapchat from before the exam. They also mention she paid people to use her clicker in class. The author is considering reporting her, which could result in severe consequences for Alice.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect: reporting someone for cheating is generally seen as the right thing to do, especially if there's evidence. Academic integrity is important, and cheating affects others by lowering grades for everyone, as mentioned in the class average being 72. The author's main concern is about the fairness and the impact on other students.\n\nHowever, there's a personal vendetta angle here. The author had a falling out with Alice because she was condescending and belittling. The question is whether this personal conflict influences the decision to report her. But the author has concrete evidence and is acting based on the academic dishonesty, not just revenge. The examples given about her cheating are specific and documented, which strengthens the case for reporting.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is using the report as a form of retaliation for past insults. But given the evidence provided, it's more about addressing actual academic misconduct. The potential consequences for Alice are serious, but the institution's policies usually require reporting such incidents to maintain integrity.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the action is based on real evidence of cheating that harmed others. The personal issues might be a background factor, but the core issue here is about academic dishonesty. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
