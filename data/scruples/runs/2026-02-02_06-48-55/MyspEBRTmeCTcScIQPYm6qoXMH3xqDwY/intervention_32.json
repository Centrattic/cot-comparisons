We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for potentially reporting a friend, Alice, for cheating. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author mentions that Alice cheated in an online exam by using sticky notes with notes, which is clear academic dishonesty. The author has evidence like texts, snaps, and a video. They also mention that Alice's actions affected the class curve, which is a valid concern because cheating can give unfair advantages and lower grades for others.\n\nBut then there's the personal vendetta angle. The author and Alice had a falling out because Alice was being condescending and calling the author \"not college material.\" The author might feel a sense of betrayal or want revenge. However, academic cheating is a serious issue regardless of personal feelings. If the author is reporting her because they're angry about past interactions, it could be seen as vindictive. But if the main reason is to uphold academic integrity, it's more justified.\n\nInstitutions have policies against cheating, and reporting it is within the student's right. However, the author has to consider the intent behind the report. If it's to help maintain fair standards, it's ethical. If it's out of spite, it's different. The author has a history of conflict with Alice, which might cloud their judgment. They might also be affected by the personal slights, but the act of cheating itself is a separate issue.\n\nThe potential consequences for Alice are severe: losing a scholarship, expulsion. The author has to weigh the public good (academic integrity) against the personal relationship. Even though they were friends, the friendship ended over mutual issues. The author isn't obligated to protect someone's academic misconduct, especially when it harms others.\n\nSo, the key points are: valid evidence of cheating, the impact on others, the institution's policies, and the author's motivation. If the author's main motivation is justice and fairness, then they're not in the wrong. If it's revenge, then it's problematic. The text says the author is focused on the effect on others (ruining the curve for 180 people), which supports the idea that the report is about integrity, not just personal issues. Therefore, the author is justified in reporting to uphold academic standards.\n"
