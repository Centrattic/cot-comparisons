We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting their friend Alice for cheating. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Alice were friends until a falling out. Alice has a history of academic dishonesty\u2014skipping classes, using Chegg, getting others to do her clicker work. Then there's the exam where she used sticky notes during a proctored online test. The author has proof like screenshots and texts. They're considering reporting her to the dean, which could cost Alice her scholarship and more.\n\nSo, the key points here. Academic integrity is generally taken seriously in educational institutions. Cheating affects not just the individual but the whole class, as mentioned with the curve. The author has evidence, so reporting might be justified. But there's a personal conflict here too. The author had a falling out with Alice, which might raise questions about motive. Is this revenge under the guise of doing the right thing?\n\nOn one hand, the author is upholding academic standards and righting a wrong that affects others. On the other hand, the timing and personal history could suggest retaliation. The question is whether the author's intent is genuine or influenced by their conflict with Alice.\n\nInstitutions usually take reports of misconduct seriously, but they also consider potential for bias. If the dean investigates and finds the evidence valid, the action is appropriate. However, if the report is seen as personal vendetta, it might backfire. But the author claims to have substantial evidence beyond just the recent exam, including her general cheating behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they act in good faith to report actual misconduct, then no. But if their primary motive is revenge, then yes. The question is whether their intent is purely based on academic integrity or personal grudge. The scenario mentions that Alice's actions affected others, so the author's concern isn't just personal. However, the prior conflict could cloud the situation.\n\nIn academic integrity policies, the focus is on the misconduct itself. If the evidence is solid, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. But if the report is malicious, it's different. Since the author presents the actions as factual and for the benefit of others, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that personal conflict could influence the report's validity, but the evidence is there.\n"
