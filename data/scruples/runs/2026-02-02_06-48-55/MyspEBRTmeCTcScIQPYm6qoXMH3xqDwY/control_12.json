We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used to be friends with Alice, but they had a falling out because Alice was being condescending and making snide remarks about the author's scholarship. Now, the author has evidence that Alice cheated in a class by using notes during an online exam. The author is considering reporting her, which might lead to Alice losing her scholarship and other consequences. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The author claims they have substantial evidence of academic dishonesty from Alice. Cheating on an exam, especially in a way that affects the class curve, is a serious offense. If the university's policies consider this cheating, then reporting it would be the right thing to do. The author mentions having texts, Snapchats, and a video showing Alice cheating. That's pretty strong evidence. \n\nBut there's also the personal history between them. They had a conflict where Alice was verbally condescending. The author might be motivated by revenge or a desire for justice after feeling belittled. However, the key point is whether the author is acting on a genuine belief that academic rules are being violated, regardless of personal feelings. \n\nUniversities typically have procedures for reporting academic misconduct. If the author follows the proper channels, like reporting to the dean with evidence, they're likely doing the right thing. The potential consequences for Alice are severe, but if she actually cheated, then the punishment is warranted. The author isn't directly harming Alice; they're reporting a violation of the rules. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is acting out of spite, that could be problematic. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that Alice's cheating affects others, which is a valid concern. The author isn't just seeking revenge; they're also protecting the fairness of the academic environment. \n\nSo, the main factors are: the validity of the evidence, the seriousness of the cheating, and the proper reporting procedure. If all those are in place, then the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
