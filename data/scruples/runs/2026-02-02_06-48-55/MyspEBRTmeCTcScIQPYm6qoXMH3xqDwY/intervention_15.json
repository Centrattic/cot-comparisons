We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a friend for cheating. The situation is that the friend, Alice, cheated on an online exam and has a history of academic dishonesty. The author has evidence and wants to report her, which could lead to losing her scholarship and other consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious offense, especially in academic settings. If Alice did cheat, then reporting her could be seen as the right thing to do because it's about upholding academic integrity. However, the author's motivations might matter here. The user mentions that there was a falling out between them, and the author felt belittled by Alice. Could this be a case of revenge?\n\nThe user says they no longer have a friendship, so maybe it's not about malice towards a current friend. The author is concerned about the impact on the class (ruining the curve) and the fairness of others being denied opportunities. On the other hand, if the author is acting out of spite because of past conflicts, that complicates things.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and academically, institutions usually encourage reporting misconduct. However, if the report is made with malicious intent, it's a different story. The author claims to have substantial evidence, which is important. Without evidence, it would be a problem, but with it, the report might be justified.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is genuinely concerned about academic dishonesty and has evidence, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the report is primarily motivated by personal grievances, it could be seen as vindictive. The narrative suggests that the author's personal issues with Alice are part of the motivation, which might make some people think it's not purely about academic integrity.\n\nBut in academic settings, the responsibility to report cheating is often emphasized regardless of personal feelings. The system is designed so that anyone can report misconduct. So even if there's a personal conflict, if the evidence is there, it's considered a duty to report to maintain integrity. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, others might argue that the personal history could influence the fairness of the report. It's a bit of a gray area, but the presence of evidence and the impact on others (like the class curve) support the action. So I think the answer is B.\n"
