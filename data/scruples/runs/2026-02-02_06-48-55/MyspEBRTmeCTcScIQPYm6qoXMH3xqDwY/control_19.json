We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting Alice for cheating. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a falling out with Alice because she was being condescending. Then, there's the issue of Alice's academic dishonesty: she skipped classes, used Chegg for homework, paid people for clicker points, and cheated on a monitored exam. The author has evidence like texts, Snapchat messages, and a video. Reporting her could lead to losing her scholarship, credits, or expulsion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing this. Legally and ethically, cheating is a serious offense. If there's clear evidence, reporting it is usually the right thing to do. However, there's a personal motive here\u2014Alice was being mean to the author. That could make it look like a personal vendetta. But the author also mentions that Alice's actions affected the entire class, not just them. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The evidence is solid and documented. 2) Cheating is a violation of academic integrity. 3) The author's personal conflict might influence their decision. But the main issue is about academic dishonesty, which institutions take seriously. \n\nThe potential problem is if the report is driven by personal grievances rather than the academic violation. However, the fact that the cheating impacted others supports the author's case. So, while there's a personal history, the act of cheating is a separate issue. If the author is reporting because of the cheating, not just because of the friendship issue, then they're acting in the interest of academic integrity. \n\nBut if the author's primary motive is retaliation for being called stupid, that could be problematic. However, the author mentions that Alice's cheating affected the class curve, which is a broader issue. So the report is justified on academic grounds. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They have valid evidence and are reporting a legitimate violation, even if there's some personal history involved.\n"
