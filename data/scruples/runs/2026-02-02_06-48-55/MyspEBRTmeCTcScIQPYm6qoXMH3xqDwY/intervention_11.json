We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about reporting a friend for cheating, which might lead to her losing her scholarship. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author had a friend, Alice, who was being dismissive and condescending. She cheated in multiple ways: using Chegg for homework, getting others to bring her clicker, and in an online exam, she used notes and got a high score. The author has evidence like texts, snaps, and a video of Alice cheating. The author is considering reporting her, possibly leading to Alice losing her scholarship or being expelled.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in reporting Alice. On one hand, cheating is against academic integrity. If the author has concrete evidence, reporting it might be the right thing to do to uphold fairness. The class average was 72, and Alice's 93% could have curved the grades, affecting others. So, there's a case for saying the author isn't in the wrong because they're exposing academic dishonesty.\n\nBut there's also the personal angle. The author mentions a falling out where Alice was being condescending. Could this be a vendetta? The author might be acting out of spite from the past conflict. However, the evidence provided seems solid, and the cheating affected others. \n\nThe key points to consider: 1) Is the evidence sufficient? The author claims to have proof. 2) Is the action taken to maintain academic integrity, or is it revenge? The description says the author snapped due to Alice's condescension, but the current action is about her cheating. 3) The potential consequences for Alice (losing scholarship, expulsion) are severe. \n\nIf the author's primary motivation is to prevent unfair advantage and protect others' grades, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the motivation is revenge, it's different. The text mentions the initial falling out but the current report is about academic misconduct. The author's mention of others who could use the scholarship suggests a genuine concern beyond personal grudges. \n\nIn academic settings, institutions typically encourage reporting dishonesty. So, from an institutional standpoint, reporting is appropriate. However, if the author is acting out of malice, that's a problem. But the evidence and the impact on others support the report. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action is to uphold academic integrity, even if there was a prior conflict.\n"
