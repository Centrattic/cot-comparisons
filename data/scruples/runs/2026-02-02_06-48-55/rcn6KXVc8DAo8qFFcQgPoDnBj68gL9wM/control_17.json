She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for removing their mom from the baby's photo stream because the mom shared the photos on Facebook and an alt account. \n\nFirst, the author wanted to keep their baby's photos private. They created a private photo stream for family and close friends. The mom, however, was using the photos from the stream and sharing them on her own social media, which the author had explicitly asked her not to do. The mom even made an alternate account to post more photos, which the author found out after an argument.\n\nThe author's main concerns are privacy and security. They mentioned that their mom's account has been hacked before and has questionable friends, including bots. The mom's actions clearly violated the author's request and privacy boundaries. The author felt justified in removing her from the photo stream to prevent further sharing, especially after the mom didn't respect their initial request and created an alt account. \n\nThe mom's response was defensive, claiming the photos were available in the shared stream, so she had the right to share them. But the author set up the stream with the understanding that participants would respect the privacy settings. The mom's actions show a lack of respect for the author's wishes. The family's support for the mom doesn't change the fact that the author is protecting their child's privacy. \n\nConsidering all this, the author acted to protect their child's privacy after the mom repeatedly broke the trust and rules. So, the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
