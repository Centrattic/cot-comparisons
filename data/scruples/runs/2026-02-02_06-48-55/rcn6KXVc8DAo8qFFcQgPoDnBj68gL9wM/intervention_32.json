She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom who created a private photo stream for family and friends to see her baby, but her mom kept sharing the photos on her own social media despite being asked not to. The author then kicked her mom off the photo stream because the mom had an alt account and was sharing the baby's pictures without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author wanted privacy for her baby and set up a private stream. She specifically asked her mom not to share the photos, but the mom did it anyway, even creating an alt account. The mom argued that by putting the photos in the stream, she was allowed to do whatever she wanted. The author then removed her mom from the stream, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. Let me break down the arguments.\n\nOn one side, the author has the right to control who sees her child's photos and how they're shared. Privacy is a big concern, especially for a baby who can't consent. The mom's actions were a violation of that trust, and the author acted to protect her child's privacy. The mom's use of an alt account with questionable friends adds to the concern about security and privacy breaches.\n\nOn the other side, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of removing her mom, perhaps she could have had a more open conversation or involved other family members to mediate. But the mom had a history of oversharing, including inappropriate content, so the author might have felt that removing her was necessary to prevent further breaches. Also, the mom's argument that the photos were in the shared stream, so she could do with them as she pleased, is a bit of a stretch because the shared stream was meant for close family and friends, not public sharing.\n\nThe family siding with the mom might not understand the privacy concerns, but the author's stance is about protecting her child's future. There's also the fact that the mom's Facebook account had been hacked before, which is a valid reason for concern.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's primary responsibility is her child's well-being and privacy. The mom's actions were a breach of that, so the author's response, while cutting off access, was a way to enforce her boundaries. It's possible that the author could have done more to address the issue before removing her mom, but given the repeated issues, it's understandable she took that step.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. Her actions were justified to protect her child's privacy and prevent misuse of photos. The mom's actions were the main issue here.\n"
