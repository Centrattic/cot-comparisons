She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for kicking their mom off the baby's photo stream because the mom overshared on Facebook.\n\nFirst, the author created a private photo stream for family and close friends to see the baby, which is a common way to share without public social media. The mom, however, despite being asked not to share the baby's photos on her accounts, did so anyway. She even created an alt account to post more pictures, which was a breach of trust and privacy. The author's main concerns are about privacy and the security risks of the mom's Facebook account (hacked before, questionable friends).\n\nThe mom argues that by sharing photos in the stream, the author made them available for her to use, which is a common argument but not valid in this context. Just because photos are shared in a private stream doesn't mean the person can redistribute them publicly. The author had a clear boundary set, and the mom crossed it. The author's action of removing the mom from the photo stream was a direct response to protect their daughter's privacy, which is a valid reason.\n\nThe family sides with the mom, but the author's decision is about their child's best interests. The mom's actions show a pattern of over-sharing, as mentioned with the other instances like posting bare butt pictures. The author's response was a necessary boundary to prevent further breaches. The fact that the mom hasn't visited since the argument might be a consequence of her actions, but the author's primary concern is justified.\n\nSo, considering the privacy violation, the author's right to set boundaries, and the mom's repeated disregard for those boundaries, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
