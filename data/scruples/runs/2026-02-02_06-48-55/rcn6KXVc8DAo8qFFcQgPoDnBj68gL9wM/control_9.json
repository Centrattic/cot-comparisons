She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for removing their mom from the baby's photo stream. The situation is that the mom kept sharing photos on her Facebook and Instagram despite being asked not to. The author set up a private stream for family and close friends, but the mom used an alternate account to share more photos. The author then kicked the mom off the stream and hasn't spoken to her since. The family sides with the mom, thinking the author is being cruel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wanted privacy for their baby, which is a valid concern. The mom repeatedly broke the trust by sharing photos despite being asked. The author had legitimate reasons: the mom's account was hacked before, and her friends were questionable. Then the mom created an alt account to keep sharing, which shows she's not respecting the author's wishes. The author's action was to remove access to protect the baby's privacy, which seems reasonable. The mom's argument that the photos were already in the stream doesn't negate the author's right to privacy, especially since the stream was meant for close family, not public sharing. \n\nAlso, the mom's history of oversharing (like posting unappropriate photos) supports the author's decision to set boundaries. The author isn't preventing the mom from seeing the baby in person; the mom can visit. The fact that the family is siding with the mom might be more about their perspective on grandparent access, but the author's main issue is privacy. \n\nSo, the author's actions were to protect their child's privacy after repeated breaches by the mom. The author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
