She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for removing their mom from the baby's photo stream after the mom shared the baby's photos on social media despite being asked not to.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to keep their baby's photos private, only sharing a generic announcement. They created a private photostream for family and friends. The mom, however, was using that photostream to post on her Facebook and Instagram, which the author objected to because of security concerns (hacked accounts, questionable friends). The author explicitly asked the mom to stop, but she continued by creating an alternate account and sharing the photos publicly. The author then kicked the mom out of the photostream.\n\nThe main issue is privacy. The author made it clear they wanted the baby's photos kept private. The mom violated that trust by sharing the photos despite the explicit request, even going so far as to create an alternate account. The author's response was to remove the mom's access, which stops the sharing. The mom's actions were the initial breach, so the author's reaction seems justified. The fact that other family members side with the mom doesn't necessarily make the author wrong; the core issue is the violation of privacy. The author had a valid reason to protect their child's privacy, especially with the security issues. The mom's argument that the photos were available in the shared stream is a flawed one, as the author's intent was for controlled sharing among close ones, not public. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
