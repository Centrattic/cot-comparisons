She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they have a 6-month-old baby and created a private photo stream for family and friends to see the baby's photos without sharing them publicly. The mom is part of this stream, but she's been posting the baby's pictures on her own Facebook and Instagram, even after being asked not to. The author found out the mom had an alternative account with more photos, including some the author hadn't even shared. The mom argued that since the photos were in a shared stream, she could do what she wanted with them. The author then kicked the mom off the photo stream, and now there's a rift between them.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They wanted to keep the baby's photos private, not just from strangers but also from people the mom might have questionable connections with, like hacked accounts or bots. The mom, on the other hand, seems to have a habit of oversharing, not just with the baby but also with other grandchildren in the past. The author had previously asked her not to post the baby's photos, and the mom didn't comply, even creating an alt account to bypass the original request.\n\nThe mom's argument that the photos are in a shared stream might seem like she has permission to use them, but the shared stream's purpose is for private sharing among family and close friends, not for public social media. The author made a clear request, and the mom violated that trust by sharing them further. The fact that the mom continued to use an alt account shows she didn't respect the boundaries set by the author.\n\nNow, considering the aftermath: the author removed the mom from the photo stream, which cut off the mom's access to the baby's photos. The other family members are siding with the mom, but they live close and can visit in person. The author's action was a response to the mom's breach of trust, not to withhold access entirely. The mom could still visit, but she hasn't. The author's stance is about maintaining privacy and trust, which is understandable given the past incidents with the mom's oversharing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It doesn't seem like it. They set boundaries, the mom violated them, and the author took action to protect their child's privacy. The mom's actions were the initial transgression, and the author's response was a necessary measure to enforce privacy. The fact that others in the family disagree doesn't make the author wrong; it's about respecting personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
