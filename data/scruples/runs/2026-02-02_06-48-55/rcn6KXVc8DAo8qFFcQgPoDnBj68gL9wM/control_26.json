She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So the situation is about a mom who's being kicked off a private photo stream because she shared the author's baby photos on Facebook and Instagram. The author made a private stream for family and friends, and specifically asked the mom not to share the baby's pics. But the mom created an alternate account, put the photos there, and now the author feels the mom is disrespecting their privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the privacy aspect. The author set up a private photostream and asked the mom not to share the photos. The mom then went against that request by using an alt account, which the author found out about. The author's main concern is privacy, especially since the mom's main account has been hacked and has questionable friends. The mom's actions could potentially expose the baby to more risk by sharing on public platforms.\n\nThe author kicked the mom off the photostream as a result. The mom hasn't visited since the argument. The family is siding with the mom, thinking it's cruel to withhold the photos. But the author argues that they already have the physical ability to visit and see the baby, so the photos should be respected as private.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author set boundaries, the mom violated them, the author took action to enforce those boundaries. The mom's argument is that by putting the photos in the stream, they're available for her to share. But the author's intent was to create a private, controlled space. The fact that the mom used an alt account to bypass the original request suggests deliberate disregard for the author's wishes. The author's response, removing the mom from the stream, is a reasonable consequence to protect their privacy. The family's side is about the mom's right to see the grandchild, but physical visits aren't the same as digital sharing. The author isn't depriving the mom of seeing the baby but is preventing unauthorized sharing. Considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
