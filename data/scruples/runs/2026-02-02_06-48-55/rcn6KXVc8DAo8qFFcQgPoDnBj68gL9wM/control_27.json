She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for removing their mom from the baby's photo stream because the mom shared the photos on social media against the author's wishes.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They specifically didn't want their baby's photos on social media beyond a basic announcement. They created a private photo stream to share with family and close friends. The mom, however, kept posting photos from that stream on her own accounts, which had been hacked before and had questionable friends. The author asked her not to do that, and the mom complied but then created an alternate account to continue sharing. \n\nThe mom's argument was that by putting the photos in the shared stream, the author implied they were okay with her using them. But the author felt this was a violation of their trust and privacy. The mom's actions also included sharing photos that the author didn't know about, which shows a lack of respect for the boundaries set.\n\nThe author then removed the mom from the photo stream. The family is siding with the mom, suggesting they feel the author is being too strict. But the author's actions were to protect their child's privacy, which is a valid concern. The mom's behavior was secretive and disregarded the author's explicit request, which is a problem.\n\nConsidering the context, the author had a legitimate reason to be concerned about their child's privacy and the security of the photos. The mom's actions were not only in violation of the author's requests but also potentially harmful if the photos were hacked. The author's response was a direct consequence to enforce their boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They acted to protect their child's privacy after the mom repeatedly breached their trust.\n"
