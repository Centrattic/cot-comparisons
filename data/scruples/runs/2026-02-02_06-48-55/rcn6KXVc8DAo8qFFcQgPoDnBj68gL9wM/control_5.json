She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about privacy and family boundaries. The author has a 6-month-old baby and has been cautious about sharing photos beyond a private photostream with family and friends. The mom, however, kept sharing the baby's pictures on her social media despite being asked not to. The author found out the mom had an alternate account posting these photos, which led to a conflict and the author removing the mom from the photostream.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They don't want the baby's photos on public platforms, especially since the mom's account has been hacked and has questionable friends. The mom, on the other hand, feels she has a right to share the photos since they were in the shared stream. But the author specifically asked her not to, and she ignored that request, even creating a new account to bypass the original restrictions. That seems like a breach of trust.\n\nThe mom's actions were persistent. She had a history of oversharing, like posting inappropriate photos of the nieces and nephews before. The author had to call her out on that, and she eventually took those down. So there's a pattern here. The author's decision to remove her from the photostream is a logical consequence given the mom's repeated violations, even if the author was strict about privacy.\n\nThe family siding with the mom might be because they see the mom's actions as just wanting to share family moments. But the author's right to control their child's privacy is significant. The baby can't consent, so the parents have the responsibility to protect their privacy. The mom's argument that the photos are \"out there\" because they're in the shared stream doesn't hold weight if the terms of that sharing were agreed upon and then broken.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014removing the mom from the photostream\u2014were a direct response to a breach of trust. It's a clear boundary being upheld. The mom's creation of an alternate account to share the photos without consent is the real issue here. The author isn't the one violating agreements; the mom is. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries, the mom crossed them, and the author took action to protect their child's privacy. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
