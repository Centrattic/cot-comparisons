She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking their mom off the photo stream after the mom shared baby photos on her own social media despite being asked not to. \n\nFirst, the author created a private photo stream for family and friends, which the mom was part of. The author had specifically asked the mom not to share the baby's photos on her social media because of privacy concerns and past hacking issues. However, the mom created an alternate account and started posting the baby's pictures there, which the author found out about.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author set boundaries and trusted the mom to respect them. The mom violated those boundaries by sharing without permission, even using an alt account. The author's response was to remove the mom from the photo stream. Others in the family think the author is being cruel, but the author's main concern is the baby's privacy and the mom's history of oversharing.\n\nThe mom's actions were a direct breach of trust. She had access to private photos and used them in a way the author didn't agree to. The author has the right to protect their child's privacy, especially given the mom's track record. The fact that the mom created an alt account shows she was trying to circumvent the author's wishes, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe author's decision to remove the mom from the photo stream seems like a reasonable response to prevent further unauthorized sharing. The mom's argument that the photos were shared in a stream she had access to doesn't negate the fact that the author's permission was required for social media use. The author isn't withholding the opportunity to see the grandchild; the mom can visit in person, which is a valid alternative.\n\nSo, based on respecting privacy boundaries and the mom's willful violation, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
