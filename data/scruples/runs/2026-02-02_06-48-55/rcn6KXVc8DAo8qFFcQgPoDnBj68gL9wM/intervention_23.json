She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking their mom off the baby's photo stream because the mom overshared on Facebook. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a 6-month-old baby and created a private photo stream for family and friends. The mom was part of that stream but started posting photos on her social media, which the author had specifically asked her not to do. The mom then created an alt account to continue sharing, including photos not even in the original stream. The author kicked the mom off the stream, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are privacy, consent, and respect. The author clearly set boundaries by creating a private stream and asked the mom not to share. The mom not only ignored the request but went further by creating an alt account, which indicates a deliberate disregard for the author's wishes. The author's action of removing the mom from the stream is a direct response to a breach of trust.\n\nThe mom's argument that the photos are \"put out there\" in the stream and thus she can do whatever she wants is legally and ethically shaky. Even if photos are shared in a private group, that doesn't grant permission for further distribution, especially without consent. The fact that the mom's account has been hacked before adds to the privacy concern, making the author's stance about security valid.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but from the details given, the author seems to have set clear boundaries and was justified in enforcing them after the mom repeatedly violated them. The author's actions were a last resort after the mom's dishonesty and disregard for privacy. Family support for the mom might be skewed, as they might not fully grasp the privacy implications. The author's decision to prioritize their child's privacy over the mom's actions seems reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
