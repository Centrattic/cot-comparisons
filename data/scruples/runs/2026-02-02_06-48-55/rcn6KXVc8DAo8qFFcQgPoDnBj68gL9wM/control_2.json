She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a mom who created a private photo stream for her baby to share with family and close friends. The author's mom was supposed to not post the baby's photos on her own social media. But the mom ignored that and made an alternate account to share the pics anyway, even though she's had privacy issues before. The author kicked her off the photo stream, and now they're not talking. The family is siding with the mom, saying the author is being cruel.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They wanted to protect their baby from being on social media, especially considering the mom's history of oversharing and security issues with her accounts. The mom, however, didn't respect that boundary by creating an alt account. The author had a valid reason to be upset. \n\nThe mom's actions were a breach of trust. Even though the photo stream was shared, the author made a clear request not to post the baby's photos. By doing so anyway, the mom violated that trust. The author's response was to remove her access, which is a direct consequence for breaking the agreed-upon rules. \n\nThe family's criticism might be based on misunderstanding the privacy concerns. The author isn't keeping the baby from the mom; they live close and can visit. The issue is about controlling who sees the photos. The mom's actions were about sharing without consent, which is a privacy issue. \n\nThe author's decision to kick her off the photo stream was a reasonable response to protect their child's privacy, especially after the mom ignored previous requests and had a history of oversharing. The mom's argument that the photos were in a shared stream doesn't justify her actions, as boundaries were set. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to set clear boundaries, and when those were broken, they took action to protect their child's privacy. The mom's behavior was the problem, not the author's response.\n"
