She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent sharing photos of their grandchild on social media without the child's parent's consent. The author, a parent, set up a private photo stream for family and friends to see their baby. The mom (the author's mother) was part of this stream but started sharing the photos on her own Facebook and Instagram, even after being told not to. The mom then created an alternate account to post more photos, which the author found out about and kicked her mom off the photo stream. Now, they haven't talked in two weeks, and the author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wanted to keep their baby's photos private, which is a common concern for parents. They set up a private stream to share with family and close friends. The mother, however, despite being asked not to, shared the photos on her social media. The author had legitimate reasons: the mom's accounts have been hacked before, and she has questionable friends. The mother then created an alt account to continue sharing, which the author discovered and took action to remove her from the stream.\n\nThe author's actions were a response to the mother's violation of their trust. The mother's defense was that by being on the photo stream, the photos were available for her to use as she liked. But the author had explicitly asked her not to, and the mother didn't respect that. The mother also has a history of oversharing, even to the point of posting inappropriate photos of other grandchildren before.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, the author's decision to kick the mom off the stream seems justified. The author had set boundaries, and the mom crossed them. The family's side-taking is against the author, but the author's primary responsibility is to their child's privacy. The mother not visiting since the argument might be a consequence, but the author's action was to protect their child's privacy, which is a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's intention might be to share joy and stay involved with her grandchild. However, the method she used\u2014ignoring the parent's wishes and using an alt account\u2014shows a disregard for the parent's boundaries and the child's privacy. The author had the right to set those boundaries, and enforcing them isn't cruel if it's about protecting their child.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a clear boundary that was violated, and their response was to protect their child's privacy. The mother's actions were the breach, so the author's action is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
