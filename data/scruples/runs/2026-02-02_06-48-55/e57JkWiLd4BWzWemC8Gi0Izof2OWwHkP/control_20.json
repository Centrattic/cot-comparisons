My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook and expects their mom to provide dinner. They came home after working on prom, expecting dinner, but mom didn't have it and told them to figure it out. They argue, and the mom points out that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying the user should be able to. The user feels wronged and asks if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family responsibilities. In many families, parents teach kids basic life skills like cooking as they grow up. The user is 17, so there's an expectation that they should be learning independence. However, the mom hasn't taught them, so the user's lack of cooking skills isn't entirely their fault. \n\nBut the user is also expecting the mom to cook every night. If the mom is working or has other responsibilities, maybe she expects the child to take on some responsibilities too. The mom might be trying to push independence, but the user hasn't learned how to cook. That's a problem because the user is relying on mom every time. \n\nThe user's anger is partly understandable because they're hungry and stressed from working on prom. But the mom's response is about teaching self-reliance, which is a valid point. The user is in a tough spot because they weren't taught but are now being expected to handle it. \n\nThe sister being 14 and able to cook adds to the user's frustration, but maybe the mom taught her, so the user feels it's unfair not to be taught. However, the user is older and should have been taught earlier. \n\nThe user's request to go to the store is denied, which is a problem because they need ingredients. Maybe the mom is being inconsistent\u2014she expects them to cook but doesn't help them get the ingredients. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the user isn't entirely wrong because the mom didn't teach them. But the user is also 17 and should have taken initiative to learn cooking themselves, maybe by watching tutorials or something. The mom's refusal to help now might be harsh, but the user's reaction (getting angry and going to their room) could be seen as immature. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the mom's failure to teach, but the user could have taken steps to learn earlier. The situation is a mix of both, but since the question is about the author being in the wrong, and the mom is the parent responsible for teaching, the author isn't at fault.\n"
