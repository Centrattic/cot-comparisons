My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and can't cook, relying on pre-packaged meals. They got home expecting dinner but their mom didn't cook. The mom says they should figure it out, and the son gets mad. The user is asking if they're the a**hole for getting angry.\n\nFirst, the son's perspective: He's 17, hasn't been taught to cook, and his mom never trusted him. He's worked late, comes home hungry, and expects dinner. When he can't make it himself, he gets frustrated. He's asking for help but the mom isn't providing it, leading to an argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's perspective: She's encouraging him to become independent, maybe testing his ability to handle responsibilities. She mentions his sister, who's 14 and cooks, implying she's taught that child. But the son feels he wasn't taught properly. The mom also refuses to drive him to buy food, which he can't do himself.\n\nIs the son in the wrong? Well, he's in a situation where he's expected to learn but hasn't been taught. Getting angry because of hunger and stress is understandable, but maybe he could have handled it better. However, the mom's refusal to help despite his inability to cook might be part of the issue. The son isn't asking for a full dinner but just help finding something he can make or driving him. The mom's response seems dismissive, which could lead to frustration.\n\nThe key factors are whether the mom provided adequate support in teaching him to cook and if the son's expectations were realistic. The son's anger stems from not being able to meet his basic need for food after a long day. The mom's lack of support in teaching him might make her partially at fault. However, the son's reaction, while understandable, might come off as entitled if he expects his mom to always cook for him without learning to do it himself.\n\nBut considering the son's age and lack of cooking skills due to not being taught, maybe he's not entirely at fault. The mom's approach of pushing him without teaching could be part of the problem. So the son might not be the a**hole here. The answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the mom didn't teach him and is now expecting him to cook without the necessary skills.\n"
