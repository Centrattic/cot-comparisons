My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old who's mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The mom says there's stuff to cook with, but the kid can't cook anything except a few simple things. The kid asks for help, like being driven to the store or teaching them, but the mom says no and says they should figure it out. The kid ends up going to their room upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The kid is 17, which is a teenager, but they've never been taught how to cook. That's a problem. The mom might be trying to get them to become independent, but maybe she didn't teach them properly. The kid is working on prom decorations, which is a valid reason for being tired and expecting dinner. \n\nBut the mom's response is dismissive. She says they should use the stuff they have, but the kid can't. The sister is 14 and can cook, which might make the kid feel like they're being compared or that the mom is being unfair. The kid is asking for help, like being driven to the store, but the mom refuses because they already have food. The kid is left without dinner, which is a problem.\n\nIs the kid being unreasonable? At 17, maybe they should be learning to cook. But the mom hasn't taught them, so it's not the kid's fault they can't. The mom is not providing support, so maybe she's in the wrong. The kid is frustrated and hungry, so their anger is justified. However, maybe the kid should have tried to make something simple despite the challenges, but since they can't use the stove properly, that's risky.\n\nSo, the kid is in a tough spot. They didn't expect to be left without dinner. The mom's approach might be trying to teach independence but without proper support. The kid's anger is about not being prepared for independence. The kid isn't entirely wrong. The mom could have helped them make something or at least explained how they could figure it out. Therefore, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might say the kid should be learning to cook and shouldn't expect dinner every night. Hmm.\n"
