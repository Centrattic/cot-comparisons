My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook and is upset because their mom didn't prepare dinner. They worked late on prom and expected dinner, but the mom told them to cook or find something themselves. The mom didn't teach them how to cook and now expects them to figure it out. The user can't drive, so they can't go to the store. They get angry and go to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. At 17, it's reasonable for a parent to be teaching their child basic life skills like cooking. However, the mom didn't teach the user and now is dismissing their inability. The sister is 14 and was taught, which the user is aware of. The mom is also not offering help, like driving them to the store, which is a barrier for the user.\n\nThe user worked late and expected dinner, which is a reasonable expectation. The mom's response seems dismissive and doesn't address the user's lack of cooking skills. The user is in a situation where they can't cook, can't drive, and the mom isn't helping. The user's anger is understandable given the circumstances. The mom's actions (not teaching, not offering assistance) contribute to the problem. So, the user isn't in the wrong here because the responsibility wasn't theirs to begin with. The answer should be B.\n"
