My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, isn't allowed to drive, and their mom expects them to figure it out. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister who can cook, but the author argues they weren't taught. The mom refuses to drive them to buy food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17 and hasn't been taught to cook. That seems like a problem because they're expected to handle basic life skills. However, the mom might be trying to encourage independence. But wait, the author isn't a kid anymore, but at 17, they might still be in high school. Depending on cultural context, some parents would teach cooking, others might not. \n\nThe author's mom says they can make something they can cook, but the author only lists very simple items. The mom's response is to tell them to get creative, but the author says they can't. The mom also mentions the sister, but the sister was taught. The author is in a position where they can't drive, so can't even get to a store. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? They were working on prom decorations until 7 PM, expecting dinner. When it's not there, they ask, and the mom is dismissive. The author's frustration is understandable. The mom might be neglecting her responsibility to provide for her child's basic needs, especially if they weren't taught essential skills. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents are generally expected to teach their children necessary life skills. If the mom didn't teach, but now expects the child to handle it, that's a bit contradictory. The author's anger stems from being unprepared and unsupported. The mom's response seems dismissive and not helpful, especially when the author is clearly in need. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They were in a situation where they weren't taught, can't drive, and the mom isn't helping. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
