My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 years old and can't cook anything beyond a few simple items like ramen, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese. They mention their mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to teach themselves. The author came home from school late, expecting dinner, but the mom told them to \"get creative\" with cooking. The mom also references their 14-year-old sister who can cook, and when the author asks to be driven to buy something they can cook, the mom refuses. The author then gets upset and goes to their room, feeling hungry.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're a teenager who hasn't been taught cooking skills, and when they need help, their mom isn't providing support. The mom's perspective: the author is 17, should be learning to be independent, and the sister is younger but still cooking. The mom might feel she's trying to teach independence, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut wait, the author can't even use the stove. If you can't cook anything and your parent isn't teaching you, then expecting you to cook might be unrealistic. Also, the author can't drive, so going to a store isn't an option. The mom says they have plenty of ingredients, but if the author doesn't know how to use them, that's a problem. The mom might be trying to push responsibility, but maybe not acknowledging the lack of prior teaching.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting mad? Well, getting angry when hungry and unsupported is natural. The mom's response might be dismissive. But the author is an adult in training (17) and might be expected to learn basic cooking. However, if the parent hasn't provided any education, it's not the kid's fault. Maybe the mom is at fault for not teaching earlier. The author is reacting to a situation where their needs aren't met. \n\nSo, is the author the asshole? I think not. They're in a bind because their parent hasn't prepared them. The mom's response seems harsh, not offering help. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
