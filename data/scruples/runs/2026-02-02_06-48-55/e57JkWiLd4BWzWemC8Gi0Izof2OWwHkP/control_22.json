My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and their mom isn't helping. They came home expecting dinner, but their mom told them to figure it out. The author got upset because they couldn't cook and the mom didn't offer help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom might feel that at 17, the child should be learning to cook. But the author argues that the mom never taught them and doesn't trust them with the stove. The sister is 14 and can cook, so maybe there's a double standard here. The mom also refuses to drive them to the store, which the author can't do themselves because they don't drive.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, they were expecting dinner after a long day. It's not unreasonable to expect a parent to provide meals, especially if they haven't taught the child to cook. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author isn't asking for a full meal but maybe some guidance or assistance. The fact that the sister was taught suggests the mom is capable of teaching, so maybe it's the mom's responsibility to help the author now.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might be trying to encourage independence. But if the author truly hasn't been taught, it's not fair to expect them to figure it out without help. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asking for support. The mom's refusal to help or provide transportation adds to the problem.\n\nSo, the author's anger is understandable given the lack of prior teaching and support. The mom's actions (or lack thereof) might be the main issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
