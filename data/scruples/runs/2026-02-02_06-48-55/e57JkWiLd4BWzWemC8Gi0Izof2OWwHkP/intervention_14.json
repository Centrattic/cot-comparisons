My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook and their mom hasn't taught them. They came home expecting dinner, but the mom expected them to make it themselves. The author is 17, can't drive, and their sister, who's 14, can cook. The mom says they should figure it out.\n\nHmm, first, the author's perspective: they feel they're not being supported. They can't cook and the mom hasn't taught them, so expecting them to cook seems unfair. They worked late at school and just want food. The mom's response is dismissive, not offering help. The author's frustration is understandable because they're stuck without the skills or means to get food.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that at 17, the child should be learning independence. But the problem is that the mom hasn't provided the necessary skills. If the sister was taught how to cook, but the author wasn't, that's a double standard. Also, the mom's refusal to drive them to the store adds to the problem. The author is in a tough spot because they're being expected to do something they weren't taught.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, getting angry might be a reaction to being left without resources. But maybe they could have found another way to handle it, like asking for help differently. But the mom hasn't taught them, so expecting them to cook is unreasonable. The author's lack of cooking skills isn't their fault; the mom is responsible for teaching them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The issue is more about the mom's lack of support. So I think the answer is B (No).\n"
