My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're 17, can't cook, and got upset with their mom because she didn't prepare dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught how to cook by their mom. They come home expecting dinner but their mom expects them to cook something themselves. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister can cook, but the author hasn't been taught. They can't drive, so they can't get groceries. The argument escalates, and the author feels really hungry and frustrated.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, at 17, depending on cultural norms, some people might expect teens to start learning basic cooking skills. However, the key here is that the mom never taught them. The author is expressing frustration that they were left without dinner when they weren't equipped to make it themselves. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering help. The author's anger might be justified because they were in a situation where they couldn't prepare food without prior instruction. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but without providing the necessary skills, it's not fair. \n\nThe sister is 14 and knows how to cook, which implies the mom did teach her. The author was left out, so there's a lack of support. The author's request to be driven to buy something they can cook is reasonable, but the mom refused. So the author's frustration is about being unprepared and not being helped. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if a parent is expecting a child to cook, they should have taught them. Since the mom didn't, she's partly responsible. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset when they're not given the tools (literally and figuratively) to handle the situation. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
