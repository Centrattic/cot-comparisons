My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid can't cook, hasn't been taught, and the mom expects them to figure it out. The mom also mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, so why can't the older one?\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The kid is 17, which is still a teenager. Not everyone learns to cook at that age, especially if the parent hasn't taught them. The mom might think it's time the kid starts being responsible, but if she never taught them, expecting them to suddenly cook without help seems unfair. The kid is working on prom decorations until 7 PM, so maybe they were tired and expected dinner. The mom didn't have dinner ready, which might be part of the issue. The kid is asking for help, like driving to the store, but the mom refuses. The kid ends up hungry and frustrated.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might see this as the kid needing to learn independence. However, if the mom didn't provide the necessary skills or support, it's not entirely the kid's fault. The kid is asking for help, not just being lazy. The mom's sister was taught, so there's inconsistency. The kid is also in a vulnerable position, relying on the parent for basic needs like food. Arguing and then leaving without a meal could be seen as a reaction to frustration, not just being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the key points are: the mom didn't teach cooking, the kid is relying on the mom for food, the mom refuses help despite the kid's limitations, and the kid is left hungry. The kid's anger is a result of the mom's lack of support. Therefore, the kid isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
