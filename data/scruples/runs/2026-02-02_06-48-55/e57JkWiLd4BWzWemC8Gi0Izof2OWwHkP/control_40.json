My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is 17, can't cook, and when they got home from school expecting dinner, their mom told them to make their own food. The mom didn't teach them how to cook and also wouldn't take them to the store. The author is upset because they're hungry and can't cook anything. Their sister is 14 and can cook, but the author was never taught. The mom's response was that the author should figure it out since they're 17.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are that the author is 17, hasn't been taught cooking skills, and the mom is expecting them to handle it on their own despite that. The mom also refuses to take them to the store for food they can cook. The author is frustrated and wants to know if they're in the wrong for getting angry.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents generally are expected to provide for their children's basic needs, including food. If the author is a minor (17 in most countries), the mom is responsible for ensuring they have food. Not having taught them to cook doesn't automatically mean the author is to blame if the parent isn't providing meals. However, the author is an older teen, so maybe some independence is expected. But if the mom isn't providing meals and isn't teaching the necessary skills, that's a problem.\n\nThe mom's response that the sister (14) can cook might imply that the author should be able to as well, but since the author wasn't taught, it's not fair to expect them to cook without instruction. The mom's refusal to take them to buy food they can make (like boxed meals) when they already have ingredients at home might be a point against her. The author is left hungry and upset, which is a result of the mom's actions or lack thereof.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's anger seems justified because they weren't given the tools to handle the situation. The mom is responsible for their care, and not providing food while expecting them to cook without prior teaching is a failure on the mom's part. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
