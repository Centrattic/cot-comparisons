My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and relied on their mom. When they came home expecting dinner, the mom said to make something themselves. The author argues they weren't taught how to cook and can't drive to get ingredients. The mom points out their sister, who is 14, can cook, implying the author should be able to too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're 17, haven't been taught cooking, and now the mom expects them to handle it. They're working on prom decorations, so they might be tired and hungry. The mom's side: she's not teaching them because maybe she thinks they should learn, or maybe she's busy. The sister is also cooking at 14, so maybe the mom expects the same.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, getting mad might be a reaction to frustration. They can't cook and were expecting dinner, which is a reasonable expectation if that's the norm. The mom not providing dinner and dismissing their inability to cook could be part of the problem. But maybe the author should have communicated better earlier, like asking for cooking lessons instead of getting upset when dinner isn't there. The mom's response might be valid because part of growing up is learning life skills. However, if the mom never taught them, expecting a 17-year-old to suddenly figure it out without help is unrealistic. The sister example is a bit conflicting because if the mom taught the younger daughter, she might be neglecting the older son/daughter.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong. They have a valid point about not being taught. But maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the main issue seems to be the mom's lack of preparation and not providing necessary education. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
