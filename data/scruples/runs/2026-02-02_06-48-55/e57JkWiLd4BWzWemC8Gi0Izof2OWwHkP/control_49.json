My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset with their mom for not providing dinner. They can't cook, they were home late from school, and their mom didn't have dinner ready. The author feels their mom isn't helping them, and the mom seems to be pushing them to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the person. They're 17, which is almost an adult. In many places, 17 is close to 18, when you become an adult. So maybe there's an expectation to start learning life skills like cooking. But the author hasn't been taught, and the mom hasn't trusted them to learn on their own. That's a key point. The mom's response was to tell them to be creative, but the author can't cook. \n\nThe mom also mentions that the author's sister, who is 14, makes her own dinner. The user points out that the mom actually taught the sister how to cook. So there's a discrepancy here. The author is older but hasn't received the same instruction. The mom's response is dismissive, not offering help. The author is left hungry and frustrated. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting mad? Well, they were in a situation where they couldn't prepare dinner themselves. They asked for help, but the mom refused. The author's anger might be justified because they were left without food after a long day. The mom's approach seems to be expecting the child to learn through trial and error, but without teaching them first. That might not be fair. \n\nHowever, at 17, there might be an expectation to start taking on more responsibility. If the author had never tried to learn despite being old enough, maybe that's a factor. But the post says the mom never taught them and didn't trust them to teach themselves. So the onus isn't entirely on the author. \n\nThe author's request to be driven to buy food that they can cook was denied. The mom had the means to help but chose not to. So the author's frustration is understandable. They're in a bind where they can't help themselves, and the parent isn't stepping in. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom is responsible for providing for the child until they are capable, and if the mom hasn't equipped them with the necessary skills, she's at fault. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
