My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a 17-year-old who can't cook anything beyond a few simple items. They came home from school working on prom decorations until 7 PM and expected dinner to be on the table. Their mom didn't have dinner ready and instead told them to figure it out. The user tried to explain they can't cook, but the mom kept pushing back, even mentioning that their 14-year-old sister can cook and that they should \"get creative.\" The user is frustrated, went to their room, and is hungry now.\n\nFirst, the user is 17 and hasn't been taught how to cook. That's quite old for that not to have happened. However, the mom might be trying to teach independence. On the other hand, the user is still a minor, maybe in high school, and it's not unreasonable for parents to provide meals. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially since the user can't drive and can't get groceries on their own. She also mentions having a sister who can cook, but she taught her. The user is asking for help, but the mom refuses, which seems harsh.\n\nThe user's anger might be justified because they were expecting dinner after a long day and were left without. The mom's expectation that a 17-year-old should be able to cook without prior teaching might be unfair. Also, the sister being 14 and able to cook suggests that maybe the mom did teach the sister, but not the user, which adds to the user's frustration. The mom's refusal to help, like driving them to the store, seems like she's not supporting the user's need for assistance despite their limitations.\n\nBut wait, some might argue that parents have a responsibility to encourage independence. However, if the user hasn't been given the tools (cooking skills) to be independent in that area, the mom's approach might be part of the problem. Also, the user is in a situation where they can't easily get food on their own because they can't drive. So the mom's response is leaving them without a viable solution.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were expecting a meal they weren't responsible for preparing. The mom might be at fault for not providing dinner and not offering support. The user's anger is a reaction to being left without food and not being supported in their need for help. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
