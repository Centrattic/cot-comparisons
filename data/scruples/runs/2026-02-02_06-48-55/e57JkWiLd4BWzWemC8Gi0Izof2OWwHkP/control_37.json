My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook much, their mom didn't teach them, and when they came home expecting dinner, their mom pushed them to figure it out. The author got upset and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is 17, which is still pretty young. If the mom hasn't taught them to cook and doesn't trust them with the stove, expecting a 17-year-old to suddenly cook without help might be unreasonable. The mom's response seems dismissive. She mentions the sister, who is 14, and that she was taught how to cook. The author also can't drive, so even if they wanted to buy something to cook, they can't go to the store. The mom refuses to help with that. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they're not being given the tools to handle the situation. The mom's approach might be trying to push independence, but without prior teaching, it's not fair. The argument escalated because the author couldn't find a solution. The author didn't do anything wrong here\u2014they're expressing frustration at their lack of skills and the mom's refusal to help. The mom's response seems to ignore the author's limitations. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're reacting to being unprepared and unsupported. The mom's actions and words contribute to the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
