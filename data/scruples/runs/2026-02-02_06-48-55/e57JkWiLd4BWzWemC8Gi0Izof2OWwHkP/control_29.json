My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is 17 and can't cook, only simple things like ramen. They came home late from school expecting dinner, but their mom told them to figure it out. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister can cook, and the author can't even use the stove. The author asked to be driven to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused. The author then went to their room angry.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they're 17 and haven't been taught to cook. The mom never taught them and doesn't trust them with the stove. The sister is younger but was taught. The mom's response seems dismissive. It's a common AITA scenario where the parent isn't providing support. The author's anger is understandable because they were expecting dinner and can't cook. The mom's responsibility might be in question here. The author isn't being unreasonable if they were relying on their mom to provide meals since they weren't taught. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
