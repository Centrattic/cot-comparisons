My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is 17 years old and can't cook anything except a few simple things. Their mom didn't teach them, and she doesn't trust them to learn on their own. They came home from school late, expecting dinner, but their mom said they should figure it out. The author got mad and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught cooking skills. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some independence, but if the parent hasn't provided the necessary skills, that's on the parent. The mom might be trying to push the kid to become more self-reliant, but maybe she didn't do it in a supportive way. The kid is clearly frustrated because they were expecting dinner and now have to fend for themselves without the skills. \n\nThe mom's response seems dismissive. She mentions their 14-year-old sister who can cook, which might not be fair if she actually taught the sister but not the older child. Also, the author can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. The mom refuses to buy pre-cooked food, which the author can't prepare. \n\nThe kid's anger comes from being left without food despite not having the skills. The mom might be trying to teach a lesson, but maybe it's too harsh considering the lack of preparation. The author isn't wrong for being upset when they're hungry and unsupported. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the child is being too dependent. But given the circumstances, the author's frustration is understandable. They were expecting dinner and now have to deal with a situation they can't handle. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're reacting to a lack of support and preparation from their parent.\n"
