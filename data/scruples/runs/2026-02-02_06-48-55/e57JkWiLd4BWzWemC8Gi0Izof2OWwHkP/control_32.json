My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home late from school expecting dinner but were told to make their own. The mom says there's stuff to cook with, but the author can't use the stove properly. The sister, who's 14, can cook, and the mom didn't help the author get groceries since they can't drive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The mom might be trying to teach independence, but the author is 17 and hasn't been taught to cook. It's possible the mom didn't realize how unprepared her child is. The author is frustrated because they can't cook and are being expected to figure it out without help. The sister was taught, so there's a discrepancy in how the mom is handling their education. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because they were left without food when they were hungry, and the mom didn't provide the necessary support. However, the author could have approached the situation differently, maybe by asking for help earlier or finding a compromise. But given that they were told they're old enough to figure it out despite not being taught, the mom's response might be part of the problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were left without dinner and support, while the mom didn't teach them to cook. The answer is B.\n"
