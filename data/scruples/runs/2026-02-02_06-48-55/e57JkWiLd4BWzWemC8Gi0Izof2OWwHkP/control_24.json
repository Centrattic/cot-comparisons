My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the 17-year-old can't cook because their mom never taught them. They came home expecting dinner, but their mom told them to figure it out. The kid points out they can't drive, can't cook, and their 14-year sister was taught how.\n\nFirst, the kid's age is 17. At that age, it's reasonable to expect some level of independence, but if the mom hasn't taught them to cook or drive, that's on her. The kid is in a situation where they can't take care of their basic needs because their parent hasn't provided the necessary skills. The mom's response seems dismissive. She says the sister can cook, but the sister is 14 and might have been taught by the mom. The kid is asking for help, like being driven to buy food they can make, but the mom refuses. \n\nThe kid's frustration is understandable. They're hungry, overworked (working on prom until 7), and their parent isn't supporting them. The mom's insistence that they \"get creative\" when they lack the skills is the problem here. The kid isn't being unreasonable; they're pointing out their lack of ability. The mom's refusal to help, even with something like driving them to the store, shows she's not providing the necessary support. \n\nSo, the kid isn't in the wrong. The mom should have taught them life skills earlier. The kid's anger is a reaction to being left without options. The answer should be B (they're not in the wrong).\n"
