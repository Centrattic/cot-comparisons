My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who can't cook and got angry at their mom for not having dinner ready. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The kid can't cook, hasn't been taught, and relied on their mom. When they come home late from school, expecting dinner, their mom tells them to figure it out. The kid is frustrated because they can't cook and the mom expects them to handle it, even though they haven't been taught. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially since the sister was taught how to cook and the kid can't drive either.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid is 17, which is an age where some level of independence is expected. Maybe the mom thought it was time for the kid to start learning. But the kid hasn't been taught and is struggling. The mom's refusal to help, even by driving them to the store, might be seen as not supporting them enough. \n\nThe key points here are whether the mom is at fault for not providing the necessary skills and support, and whether the kid is in the wrong for getting angry. The kid's frustration is understandable given the lack of teaching, but maybe they could have handled the situation better. However, the mom's approach might be contributing to the problem. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the mom has a responsibility to teach cooking skills and if the kid's anger was justified given that they were never taught. The kid is in a tough spot because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping, but maybe the kid should have tried to find a solution earlier instead of waiting until they're home. However, the mom not teaching them anything except basic microwave foods is a significant issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mom might share some responsibility. But the kid's reaction of getting angry and going to their room could be seen as excessive. However, their frustration is valid. The answer might be that the kid isn't entirely in the wrong because the mom hasn't provided the necessary support. But maybe there's a balance here. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mom hasn't taught the kid to cook and is now expecting them to handle it without help, which is unfair. The kid's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and not supported, which the mom is partly responsible for. So the kid isn't in the wrong.\n"
