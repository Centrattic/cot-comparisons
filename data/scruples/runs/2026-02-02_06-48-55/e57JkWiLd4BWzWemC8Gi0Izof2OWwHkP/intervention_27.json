My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old who can't cook and is upset with their mom for not providing dinner after coming home from school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. 17 is still pretty young, and it's mentioned that the mom never taught how to cook. The sister is 14 and was taught, so maybe the author feels it's unfair. But the mom might be encouraging independence. However, the author can't use the stove properly and can't drive to get food. So maybe the mom is being a bit negligent? Or is it the author's responsibility to learn?\n\nThe author is angry, which might be seen as a bit immature. But the mom's response seems dismissive. The key points are that the author hasn't been taught, the mom expects them to figure it out, and there's no support. The sister, even though younger, was taught, so there's a possible double standard. \n\nAlso, the author is hungry and frustrated. The mom's refusal to help could be contributing to the problem. Maybe the author should have tried to learn earlier, but the mom's lack of teaching is a factor. So maybe it's a shared responsibility. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mom is responsible for teaching, she's at fault. If the author is expected to be independent despite not being taught, then perhaps the author is in the wrong for not taking initiative. But given the lack of instruction and the author's age, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nHmm, some might say the author is in the wrong for not learning earlier, but others might side with the author given the mom's role in not teaching. The argument about the sister being taught might show that the mom is capable and willing, making the author's situation more about neglect. \n\nI think the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The mom's failure to teach and provide support is the main issue here. The author's anger is justified given the circumstances of not being taught and being left without options.\n"
