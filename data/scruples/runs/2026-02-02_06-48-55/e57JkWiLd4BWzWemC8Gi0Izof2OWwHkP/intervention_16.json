My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and expected dinner after school. The mom didn't prepare anything, told them to cook themselves, and when the author asked for help, the mom refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is young, 17, and hasn't been taught cooking. They can only make a few simple meals. They worked on prom decorations until 7 PM and came home expecting dinner. When faced with the task of cooking, they got frustrated. The mom's response was dismissive, using the sister as an example, who is 14 and was actually taught. The author can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. They ended up going to their room hungry.\n\nNow, from the author's perspective, they have a legitimate issue. They weren't taught essential life skills like cooking. At 17, expecting them to self-teach without any guidance might be unrealistic. The mom's response seems harsh, not considering the author's limitations. However, the author's reaction was to get mad and go to their room, which could be seen as avoiding the problem. They didn't try to resolve it calmly, like asking for step-by-step help or using online resources. Instead, they lashed out.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might be trying to teach independence, but she didn't provide the necessary tools for the author to succeed. The sister was taught, so the author wasn't given the same opportunity. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might be the issue. Getting angry instead of seeking help or finding an alternative solution (like using a tutorial) could place some responsibility on the author.\n\nBut then again, the mom's approach was flawed. She didn't offer support or recognize the author's lack of skills. The author's anger stems from being left without resources. In that case, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. They had a valid reason to be upset. However, the way they expressed their anger might be where they went wrong. Instead of arguing, they could have asked for specific help or tried to find another solution.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and unsupported. The mom's failure to teach cooking is a significant factor. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for being upset, but their response could have been more constructive. However, the primary issue is the mom's lack of teaching. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural expectation here. In some families, expecting teens to cook might be normal, but the author's lack of skills is due to the mom's refusal to teach. So, the author's anger is justified. Therefore, B might be correct.\n"
