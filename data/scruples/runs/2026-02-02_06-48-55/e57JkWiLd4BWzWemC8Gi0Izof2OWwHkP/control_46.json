My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid can't cook, hasn't been taught, and after coming home from a long day, the mom won't help. The mom's responses seem pretty dismissive.\n\nFirst, the kid is 17, which is an adult age in many ways, but cooking isn't a skill everyone learns at home. The mom didn't teach them and now is telling them to figure it out. The sister is 14 and can cook, but the mom actually taught her. So there's inconsistency there. The kid can't even use the stove properly. The mom refuses to drive them to buy food they can cook, even though they can't drive themselves. That seems like a lack of support. \n\nThe kid's frustration is understandable. They worked late at school, expecting dinner, and the mom didn't provide anything. The argument that the kid is in the wrong for getting angry might not hold because they were left without a meal and support. The mom's behavior seems neglectful. Maybe there's a cultural expectation here\u2014some parents do cook for their kids, others don't. But the kid is in a position where they can't take care of themselves, and the mom isn't helping. The kid's anger is a reaction to being left without resources. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The mom is responsible for providing support, especially when the kid hasn't been taught necessary life skills. The kid's frustration is valid given the circumstances.\n"
