My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old who can't cook and got upset with their mom for not providing dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they can't cook anything beyond simple items like ramen. They worked late on prom decorations and expected dinner, but their mom didn't have one ready and insisted the kid figure it out. The mom did mention that the author's 14-year-old sister can cook, and she's not driving the author to buy food. \n\nThe author got angry and went to their room. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the author's side: At 17, not knowing how to cook is unusual, but maybe the mom didn't teach them. The author worked late and had a right to expect dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive and possibly neglectful, especially since she didn't offer help despite the son's inability to cook. The mom also mentions the 14-year-old sister knows how to cook, which implies she could have taught the son earlier. \n\nFrom the mom's perspective, she might be trying to encourage independence. However, expecting a 17-year-old who hasn't been taught to cook to suddenly figure it out without assistance, especially when they can't drive to get food, is unreasonable. The mom's refusal to help despite having the resources (like driving) seems like she's not supporting her child's needs. \n\nThe author's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner despite their efforts and inexperience. While getting upset might not be the best approach, the root cause is the mom's failure to provide for a basic need. The author isn't wrong for being frustrated when their parent isn't fulfilling their role. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the mom's actions are questionable. She didn't teach the son to cook, didn't provide dinner despite his work, and refused to help him get food. The son's anger stems from being left hungry and unsupported. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might have handled it differently, but the blame isn't on them. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
