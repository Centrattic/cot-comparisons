My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who can't cook, comes home from a long day of school work and expects dinner, but the mom says they have to make something themselves. The author gets mad and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. At 17, it's reasonable to start learning life skills like cooking, but the author mentions they've never been taught and the mom doesn't trust them with the stove. The author also can't drive, so buying pre-cooked meals isn't really an option unless they can be driven. The mom says they have plenty to cook with, but the author isn't confident in their abilities.\n\nNow, the key points: The author expects dinner after a late day, but the mom isn't providing it. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they can't cook and have no means to get food. The mom's response seems dismissive, pointing to their sister who is only 14 and might have been taught. The author is in a situation where they're not equipped to handle cooking, so expecting them to make dinner might be unreasonable. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think the author should be more self-sufficient. However, the author's lack of skills and access to resources is a significant factor. The mom's refusal to help when the author can't drive or use the stove effectively might make her responsible for not providing support. The argument might be that the author is entitled to some help since they haven't been taught. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom might have failed to teach necessary skills. The author being mad because they're hungry and unable to prepare a meal is a valid reaction. The sister example doesn't directly address the author's situation if they weren't taught. So the author might not be in the wrong here because the mom didn't provide the necessary training or assistance. The answer would be B, No.\n"
