My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 17, can't cook, and their mom hasn't taught them. They came home late from school expecting dinner, but their mom told them to figure it out. The author argues that they can't cook and that their mom never taught them. The mom's response is that they should figure it out, and even mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying she was taught. The author wants to go to the store but can't drive, and the mom refuses to buy food when they already have ingredients.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's lack of cooking skills, the mom's refusal to teach or help, the age of the child (17), and the expectation of self-sufficiency. The author feels wronged because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping, while the mom might feel that the kid should be responsible by now.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, at 17, some parents might expect their child to be learning life skills, including cooking. However, the mom hasn't taught them, and now is holding that against them. The author is in a position where they can't be self-sufficient because the skills weren't provided. The mom's response of \"figure it out\" when the kid can't cook seems dismissive. The sister being 14 and able to cook suggests the mom did teach her, so maybe there's a double standard here. The author is asking for help, but the mom isn't offering it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be expected to start learning at some point. But given that the mom never taught them, and now is refusing to help when the kid is dependent on her for meals, it's a bit of a catch-22. The author's frustration is understandable. They want to learn but aren't given the opportunity. The mom is refusing to take them to the store even though they can't drive. So the author's anger is a reaction to being left without resources. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mom might be right in expecting some independence at 17, but she hasn't provided the necessary skills. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated because they were never taught. The mom's refusal to help when she's the one who didn't teach them could make her the one at fault. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
