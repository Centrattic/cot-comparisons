My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, hasn't been taught, is 17, and their mom expects them to figure it out. The mom mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, and the author can't drive, so they can't go to the store. The author then goes to their room and is hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're 17, haven't been taught how to cook, and their mom isn't helping when they need it. They worked late and expected dinner. The mom's perspective: she might feel that the author is old enough to learn, maybe she thinks they should have learned earlier, and perhaps she's trying to encourage independence. She might also be under the impression that they can use the resources available, or maybe she's had to teach the younger sister because of the author's lack of initiative.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the author, the lack of cooking skills, and the mother's response. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of independence, but the mother's role in not teaching them is a factor. However, the author is also responsible for learning some basic cooking skills, especially since they can't rely on their mom every time. The argument is about expectations and responsibility. The author is upset because they need help but the mom isn't providing it, while the mom might be pushing them to be self-sufficient.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're asking for help they weren't given, but there's a part where they could have taken initiative earlier. However, the mom's refusal to help in this specific instance is a problem. The author worked late and had a legitimate expectation of dinner. The mom's response was dismissive, which led to the argument. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. The mother might argue that the author should have learned by now, but the author's case is that they weren't taught. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is seeking help they were never given, and the mom isn't providing necessary support.\n"
