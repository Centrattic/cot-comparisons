My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and got mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. They worked on prom decorations until 7 PM and expected dinner. The mom said they should cook themselves, but the author can't. The mom mentions the 14-year-old sister can cook, and won't drive them to buy food. The author is now hungry and frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager. It's common for parents to teach their kids basic cooking skills as they grow up. The author says they've never been taught, which might put some responsibility on the parents. However, at 17, there's also an expectation to start learning independence. But can you really expect a 17-year-old who's never been taught to cook to just figure it out? Maybe not.\n\nThe mom's response seems dismissive. She says \"whatever you can find\" and \"get creative\" without offering help. The sister is 14 and already knows how to cook, so the mom might be inconsistent in her teaching. Also, the author asked to be driven to the store, but the mom refused. That's another point\u2014denying transportation when the author can't drive themselves.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They worked late and just wanted dinner. The mom's refusal to help or teach them, despite the author's lack of cooking skills, could be seen as neglecting her responsibility as a parent. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting to eat; they're asking for something they can't do on their own yet.\n\nBut maybe the author is being a bit entitled. At 17, expecting mom to always cook might not be fair. However, the key point is that they were never taught. If the parent never taught them, it's not the teen's fault they can't cook. So the mom is at least partially responsible for not preparing them.\n\nSo, combining these factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The parent's failure to teach and the dismissive attitude play a big role here. The author's reaction is a result of the parent's inaction. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
