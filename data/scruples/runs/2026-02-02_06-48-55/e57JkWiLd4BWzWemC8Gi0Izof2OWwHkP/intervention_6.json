My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see... They're 17, can't cook much, and got mad at their mom for not making dinner. They came home after working on prom decorations until 7 PM, expecting dinner, but their mom said to figure it out. The mom didn't teach them how to cook, and the sister, who's 14, can cook. The author can't drive, so getting to the store isn't an option. They got upset and went to their room.\n\nHmm. First, the age is 17, which is almost an adult. But in many places, 17 is still a minor, so maybe there's an expectation that parents help. However, the mom might be trying to teach independence. The author didn't mention asking for help earlier. They came home expecting dinner, but maybe they didn't communicate their needs better. The mom did say there are ingredients, but the author can't cook. Is it the author's responsibility to learn? The mom might feel it's time they start learning. On the other hand, the mom didn't teach them, so maybe she's also at fault for not preparing them. The author's frustration is understandable, but reacting by getting angry and storming off might not be the best approach. The sister is 14 and can cook, so maybe the author should have learned earlier. But the mom didn't teach them. It's a bit of a toss-up. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the mom didn't teach them, but maybe the author could have taken steps to learn earlier. However, the situation is complicated. Maybe the author is in the right because the mom didn't provide the necessary skills. So I think the answer is B (No).\n"
