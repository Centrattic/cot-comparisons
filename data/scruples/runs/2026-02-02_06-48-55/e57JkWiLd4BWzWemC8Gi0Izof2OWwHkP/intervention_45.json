My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 years old and can't cook anything beyond a few simple items. The mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. The author comes home late from school expecting dinner, but the mom says to \"get creative.\" The author points out they can't cook, and the mom responds that they're 17 and should figure it out. The mom also mentions that the 14-year-old sister can cook, which the author notes because they weren't taught. The author asks for a ride to the store, but the mom refuses. The author then gets fed up and goes to their room.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author is 17 and expected to be more independent. Parents might argue that it's time the child learns to cook, especially since the sister is younger but already taught. The mom might feel she's doing her part by having the sister cook, and that the author should take responsibility. However, the author's point is valid: they were never taught, so expecting them to cook without instruction isn't fair. The mom's refusal to help or provide resources (like a ride to buy something they can cook) adds to the problem. The author is in a situation where they lack the skills and the means to get help, leading to frustration. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of prior teaching and the mom's refusal to assist despite the author's clear inability. The author's anger stems from being placed in a situation without the necessary support. While the author's age does suggest some independence, the mom's role in not equipping them with skills or offering solutions (like teaching) might make her also at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without support, which could be reasonable. Alternatively, maybe the author should have known to bring up cooking lessons earlier or find another way to manage. However, given the mom's consistent refusal to teach or help, the author's frustration seems justified. So, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
