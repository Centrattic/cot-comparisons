My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 17 and can't cook. They mention that their mom never taught them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. They worked on prom decorations until 7 PM and came home expecting dinner. Their mom said there was nothing ready and told them to figure it out. The author can't cook much, just some simple things like ramen, chicken nuggets, etc. They tried to explain they can't cook, but their mom said they're 17 and should be able to figure it out. The mom also mentions their 14-year-old sister cooked her own dinner, implying that the author should be able to do the same. The author asked to be driven to the store to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused, saying there's already plenty. The argument continues until the author gets fed up and goes to their room.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? AITA (Am I the Asshole)?\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's side. They're 17, haven't been taught how to cook, and their mom hasn't allowed them to drive. They can't cook much and relied on mom for dinner. When they came home late from school work, expecting dinner, but mom didn't have it. The mom's response seems dismissive, not considering that the author isn't capable of cooking. The author is hungry and upset because they can't do what their younger sister can, but the sister was actually taught by the mom. The author is frustrated because they were never taught and now are being forced to cook without the means (no car, no skills).\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might be trying to encourage independence. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of self-sufficiency. However, the mom hasn't provided the necessary training or resources. The fact that the mom taught the 14-year-old sister but not the author seems contradictory. The author is in a position where they can't drive, so even if they wanted to get food, they can't. The mom's refusal to help in that situation might be contributing to the problem.\n\nThe argument here is about responsibility. The author is not at fault for being unable to cook, as that's the mom's responsibility. However, the author is 17, and maybe the mom is trying to push them to learn. But if they weren't taught, then the mom's approach of just telling them to figure it out isn't helpful. The author is also working hard (prom decorations) and coming home expecting dinner, which is a reasonable expectation. The mom's response seems to ignore the author's limitations and the fact that they were never given the tools to cook.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily the one at fault. They're in a situation where their mom hasn't provided the necessary skills, and they're being expected to do something they can't. The mom's response is part of the problem. The author's anger is understandable given the circumstances. They're not being unreasonable for being hungry and not knowing how to cook. The mom is more at fault for not teaching them and not offering help. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
