My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the story is at fault for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The person is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner, but the mom said to figure it out. The author argues that the mom didn't teach them, so they can't cook. The mom's response was to tell them to get creative, and when the author asked for help, she refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a legal adult but still young. They mention they can't cook anything except very simple items. The mom might feel that the child is old enough to start learning, especially since the sister (14) can make her own dinner. However, the mom also didn't teach them, so maybe she's partly responsible for not teaching the necessary skills. \n\nThe author's request for help (like driving to the store or getting instructions) was denied. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but the author isn't in a position to be independent in this case. The frustration comes from not having the skills or the resources to cook. The author getting fed up and going to their room is a reaction to being left without food, which is understandable if they're truly unprepared.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They did express frustration, which is a normal reaction when hungry and not able to help themselves. However, maybe they should have anticipated not having dinner and planned ahead, like bringing food from school or having snacks. But the situation is that they worked late, expected dinner, and the mom didn't provide it. The mom's responsibility as a parent is to ensure the child's basic needs are met, even if they're learning independence. If the child isn't capable of cooking, the parent might still need to provide meals until the child can learn.\n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were not taught and the mom didn't provide support. The mom could be at fault for not teaching and not helping when the child asked. The author's anger is a result of the mom's lack of support. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author should be more self-sufficient, even if they weren't taught. But at 17, expecting someone to cook without any teaching is unrealistic. So the author isn't at fault here."
