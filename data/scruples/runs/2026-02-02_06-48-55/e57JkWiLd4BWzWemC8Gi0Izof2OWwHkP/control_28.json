My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and can't cook, only simple things like ramen. They come home after a long day at school expecting dinner, but their mom says to figure it out. They argue, and the user gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, the core issue is whether the user is at fault for being angry. The user rationalizes that they can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. The mom's response is to encourage independence, mentioning their 14-year-old sister who can cook. But the user points out that the sister was actually taught by the mom, while they weren't.\n\nI need to consider the age and responsibilities. At 17, some level of independence is expected, but it's also a time when many are still learning basic life skills. If the mom didn't teach them, maybe she's responsible for their lack of cooking skills. The user's frustration is about being left out and not having the same opportunities as their sister. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store, combined with not teaching them, could be seen as not supporting them. The user's anger might be justified if they feel neglected in learning these skills. However, maybe they should have taken initiative to learn earlier. But since the mom never taught and didn't trust them, the user's position is weaker. So, is the user in the wrong? They didn't ask to be left in that situation, but maybe they should have learned somehow. However, the mom's role is to teach, so if she didn't, the user isn't at fault for the anger. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
