My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who got mad at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says they can't cook and their mom never taught them. They\u2019re 17 and can only make simple things like ramen or mac and cheese. They worked late on prom decorations and expected dinner. When they asked, the mom said they should use what's there and figure it out. The author points out their sister, who's 14, cooked her own dinner, implying they were taught. The mom also refused to drive them to buy food.\n\nThe author is frustrated because they feel their mom never taught them and now expects them to cook without help. The mom's response seems to be pushing for independence but maybe not considering the child's limitations. The author is hungry and upset, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But from the story, the author seems to be in a situation where they weren't taught essential life skills. The mom's response might be neglecting their needs. However, 17 is an age where some independence is expected. The author could be seen as not taking initiative, but if they weren't taught, that's the parent's responsibility. The sister being 14 and taught might show the mom can teach, but maybe not giving the same attention to the older child.\n\nIs the author at fault for being upset? They have valid reasons if they were never taught. But maybe they should have tried to find a solution on their own, like using online resources. However, the mom's refusal to help or drive them to buy food adds to the conflict. The author\u2019s anger might be justified given the lack of support.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. The mom could be the one at fault for not providing necessary guidance. But maybe the author should have tried harder. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the parent is responsible for teaching cooking skills. If the parent isn't teaching, the child isn't at fault for not knowing. The author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and unhelped, which could be understandable.\n"
