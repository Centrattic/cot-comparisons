My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The question is about a 17-year-old who gets mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The person can't cook much beyond a few simple things, and the mom expects them to figure it out. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The kid is 17, can't cook much, and their mom hasn't taught them. They come home expecting dinner after working on prom decorations until 7 PM. The mom says \"whatever you can find\" and the kid can't figure it out. The mom points out that the sister, who's 14, can cook, but the kid isn't trusted to drive to get food. The argument escalates, and the kid goes to their room.\n\nNow, considering the age and the parent's role. At 17, it's reasonable for parents to start teaching life skills like cooking. However, the mom's response seems dismissive. If she hasn't taught them, expecting a 17-year-old to just \"figure it out\" might be unrealistic. The sister was taught, so the kid is left without the same support. The mom also doesn't offer help, like driving them to buy food, even though they can't drive. That lack of support could be a problem.\n\nThe kid's frustration is understandable. They worked late and are starving. Being told to \"get creative\" without the necessary skills leads to conflict. The mom's response might be seen as neglecting her responsibility to teach and support. However, the kid did get angry and left the situation. But given the mom's lack of assistance, maybe the kid isn't entirely at fault.\n\nConsidering both sides: The mom hasn't taught cooking, dismissed the kid's inability, and refused help. The kid is reacting to being unprepared and unsupported. The kid's anger is a response to being set up for failure. The mom's approach might be harsh. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural context or other factors. In many cases, parents are expected to teach life skills, so the mom's failure here is a key point. The kid's reaction, while maybe a bit impulsive, is justified given the circumstances.\n"
