My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom never taught them, and they're 17. The situation is that they came home expecting dinner, but their mom told them to figure it out. They tried to argue that they can't cook, but the mom pushes back, mentioning their sister who can cook and not allowing them to go to the store. The author then gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but the author has a valid point that they weren't taught how to cook. At 17, being expected to cook without prior instruction could be unreasonable. However, the author is also expected to take some initiative. Maybe they could have tried to learn earlier, but the mom's lack of teaching is a problem. The author's frustration is understandable because they're hungry and not being supported. The mom's response, especially mentioning the younger sister who was taught, might be unfair. The author is in a position where they can't drive or go to the store, so the mom isn't helping them get the resources they need.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They got angry, but their anger stems from being unprepared for independence. Maybe they should have taken responsibility earlier, but the mom's role in not teaching them is a key factor. It's a bit of a grey area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the mom didn't provide the necessary skills. However, the author could have tried to learn earlier instead of waiting until they were in a situation where they needed to cook. The mom's response is dismissive, which adds to the problem. I think the author isn't entirely at fault here. So the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
