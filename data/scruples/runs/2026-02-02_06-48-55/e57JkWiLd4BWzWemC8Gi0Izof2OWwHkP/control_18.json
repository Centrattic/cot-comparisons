My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook because their mom never taught them. They got home expecting dinner, but their mom didn't have any prepared and told them to figure it out. The author argues that since their sister, who is younger, was taught how to cook, they should have been taught too. They also mention they can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option.\n\nFirst, the mom's responsibility: At 17, it's reasonable for parents to expect their child to start learning basic life skills, including cooking. However, the mom did not teach the author and now is expecting them to cook without prior instruction. That seems like a problem on her part. She also didn't offer any help when the author asked to go to the store, which is a barrier since they can't drive.\n\nThe author's actions: Getting mad and going to their room. While it's understandable to be frustrated, reacting with anger might not be the best approach. However, the situation is that they were left without dinner despite the mom's responsibility to ensure they have meals. The sister being taught and the author not being taught is a point in the author's favor. The mom's response of \"you can figure it out\" when the author has no prior training seems unreasonable.\n\nPotential issues: The author is old enough to be learning these skills, but the mom hasn't provided the necessary support. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner and not being given the tools to make it themselves. The mom's refusal to drive them to buy food despite having resources at home might be seen as neglecting their basic needs.\n\nConsidering cultural factors: In some families, kids are taught cooking earlier, but 17 is still young for expecting someone to be completely self-sufficient. The author's inability to cook anything else except pre-packaged meals suggests a lack of training.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Arguably, the mom is more at fault for not providing the necessary skills and support. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. While getting angry isn't the best approach, it's a reaction to being left hungry without the means to prepare a meal. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
