My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 and can't cook much beyond simple things like ramen. They mention not being taught by their mom and not being trusted to learn on their own. The key points here are their age, lack of cooking skills, and the mom's refusal to help. \n\nWhen the author gets home late from school and expects dinner, their mom says they should \"get creative\" and implies the author should figure it out. The author tries to explain their inability to cook, and the mom points out their sister, who's 14, can make her own dinner. The author asks for a ride to buy something they can cook, but the mom refuses.\n\nThe author then gets fed up, goes to their room, and is still hungry. The question is whether they're in the wrong for getting angry.\n\nLooking at the dynamics: At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of independence, but the author hasn't been taught cooking skills. The mom's response seems dismissive and doesn't address the root issue. She taught their sister but not the author. The author's frustration is understandable because they're in a situation where they can't prepare a meal themselves. The mom's refusal to help, including not driving them to the store, exacerbates the problem. \n\nHowever, the author might be expected to start taking more responsibility. But given the mom's role in not providing the necessary skills, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. Still, the author's reaction of getting angry might be seen as a bit much if they didn't consider other options (like using pre-made meals they can cook), but the mom's lack of support is a significant factor.\n\nI think the key here is that the mom didn't teach the author to cook, even though the author clearly needs those skills. The author is in a position where they can't be responsible for their own meals without proper training. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that at 17, they should have started learning to cook. However, the mom's role in not teaching them makes the situation more complex. The author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and not supported. So the answer is probably B (author not in the wrong).\n"
