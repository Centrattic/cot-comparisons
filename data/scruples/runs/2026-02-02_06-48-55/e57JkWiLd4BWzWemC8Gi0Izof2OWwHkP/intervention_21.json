My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. \n\nThe situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, can't cook and didn't have dinner prepared by their mom. They came home expecting dinner, but their mom told them to figure it out. The author argues that their mom never taught them how to cook and that their younger sister, who is 14, was able to make her own dinner because the mom actually taught her. The author wanted to go to the store to buy something they could cook but their mom refused. The author got mad and went to their room.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's inability to cook despite being 17, the mom's refusal to teach or help, the sister being taught, and the mom's lack of support when the author asked for help. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is a teenager who might expect their parents to provide meals, especially if they haven't been taught how to cook. On the other hand, parents might argue that 17 is an age where kids should start learning independence, but in this case, the mom didn't teach the author, and the sister was taught earlier. The mom's response seems dismissive, not offering practical help. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because they were left without food and couldn't cook. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store adds to the problem. However, the author could be expected to handle the situation more calmly instead of getting angry and leaving. But given the circumstances\u2014being hungry, not knowing how to cook, and not getting help\u2014it's reasonable for them to feel upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's anger is justified given the mom's lack of support, then they aren't in the wrong. But if they should have managed their expectations or handled it better, then maybe they are. However, the mom's actions (not teaching, dismissing the request for help) seem to be the root cause here. The author's anger stems from being left without food and not being supported. So I lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
