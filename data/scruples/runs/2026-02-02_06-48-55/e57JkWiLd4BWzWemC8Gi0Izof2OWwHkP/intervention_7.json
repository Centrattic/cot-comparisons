My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The person is 17, can't cook anything beyond basics, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home late after working on prom decorations and expected dinner, but their mom refused to help. The mom points out that the sister (14) can cook, but the user can't drive either. The user got upset and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The mom's perspective: She might feel that at 17, the child should be learning to cook. She mentions the sister is 14 and can do it, so maybe she's trying to encourage independence. However, she didn't teach the child, so expecting them to \"figure it out\" might not be fair. The child's side: They're 17, haven't learned to cook, and now are left in a situation where they have no option but to be responsible for something they weren't taught. They worked late and were hungry. The mom's refusal to help or take them to the store adds to the frustration.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to consider if the frustration is justified. The mom didn't teach them, so expecting them to cook without any training is unfair. However, the author's reaction\u2014getting mad and going to their room\u2014might be seen as immature. But maybe the root is the lack of preparation and support from the parent. The parent also didn't offer alternatives like ordering food or sharing a meal. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents are usually expected to provide for their children's basic needs, including meals. If the child can't cook and the parent hasn't taught them, it's the parent's responsibility to either provide meals or teach. The parent's response seems dismissive. The author's anger might stem from being left without options after being unprepared. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They might be reacting to a lack of support. However, the argument could be that at 17, they should be learning to cook, but the parent hasn't provided that education. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the parent failed to provide necessary skills and support.\n"
