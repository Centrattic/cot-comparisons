My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who can't cook and got mad at their mom for not preparing dinner. The mom says there's stuff to cook with and that the sister can make her own, but the author can't. They wanted to go to the store but mom refused.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, which is a teenager but not an adult yet. They mention they can't cook anything except a few simple things. The mom never taught them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. So maybe the mom is partly responsible for not teaching them earlier. However, the author is now expecting the mom to cook dinner after they came home late from school. \n\nThe mom's response was to tell them to get creative with what's available. But the author can't cook, so maybe they should have planned ahead or learned earlier. However, the mom also didn't support them in learning. The sister is 14 and taught how to cook, which adds to the frustration. \n\nThe author got mad and went to their room. The mom didn't buy food even though they had ingredients, but the author can't make them. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nI think the mom is also in the wrong for not teaching the author to cook and not providing support. However, the author is 17 and should be starting to take some responsibility for their needs. But since the mom didn't teach them, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Maybe the expectation here is that a 17-year-old should have learned basic cooking by now. But depending on the family dynamics, maybe not. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the mom didn't prepare them for independence. However, the author could have tried to learn earlier or communicated better. But since the mom didn't teach, the responsibility isn't solely on the author. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
