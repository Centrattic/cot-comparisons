My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and the mom didn't teach them. The author came home late from school expecting dinner, but the mom said they should figure it out. The author argues that they can't cook, the mom says they should figure it out, and the author ends up upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is an adult at 17, which is the age of majority in some places. However, they might still be a minor depending on the country. They mention not being allowed to drive, which might indicate they're still under their parents' care. The mom's responsibility as a parent is in question here. Teaching kids basic life skills like cooking is part of parenting, so the mom might be at fault for not teaching the author. However, the author is 17, so maybe there's an expectation for them to start learning independence. But the author clearly states they haven't been taught and the mom doesn't trust them. The sister, who's 14, was taught how to cook, which shows inconsistency. The author is in a bind because they can't cook, can't drive, and the mom won't buy them food. The author's frustration is valid because they're hungry and the situation is unfair. The mom's response seems dismissive. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is probably B.\n"
