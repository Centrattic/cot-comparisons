My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 years old and can't cook much beyond simple things like ramen. Their mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. The author works on school stuff until 7 PM and expects dinner. When they get home, there's no dinner, and the mom tells them to \"get creative.\" The author points out they can't cook and that their 14-year-old sister can because the mom taught her. The mom refuses to help, so the author gets fed up and goes to their room.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author isn't able to cook because their mom didn't teach them. They have a legitimate need for dinner after working late, but their mom is unhelpful. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially since the sister was taught. The author's frustration seems justified given their lack of skills and the mom's refusal to assist despite having the means (like driving them to the store, which she won't do either).\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's anger stems from being hungry and not having the skills to make dinner, which is the mom's responsibility. The mom didn't teach them, didn't help, and even compared them to the younger sister who was taught. The author's reaction might be seen as reasonable because they were expecting dinner and didn't know how to prepare it. The mom's response could be seen as neglectful. \n\nHowever, some might argue that at 17, the author should be learning basic life skills, but the mom hasn't provided that opportunity. The author's frustration isn't just about not getting dinner but also about the lack of support in learning. The mom's refusal to drive them to buy food they can cook adds to the problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both sides. But in this case, the mom's role in not teaching and not offering help seems to be the root issue. The author's anger is a response to their unmet needs and the mom's inaction. Therefore, it's more likely that the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
