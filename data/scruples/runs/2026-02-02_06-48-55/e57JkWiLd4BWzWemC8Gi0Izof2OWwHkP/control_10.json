My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and expected dinner after coming home late from school. Their mom didn't make dinner and instead told them to figure it out. The author felt frustrated because they were never taught how to cook and their sister, who is 14, was taught. The mom also refused to take them to the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a minor, 17, and maybe it's time they start learning life skills. However, the mom never taught them, so expecting them to suddenly cook without any guidance might be unfair. The author was working on prom decorations until 7 PM, which is late, and might be tired. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially since she taught the younger sister. Also, the author can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option without the mom's help. \n\nBut the author is an adult in some states, so maybe they should take responsibility? However, the key point is that the mom didn't teach them. The argument is about expectations. The author expected dinner, but the mom didn't set up the expectation that the child would cook. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they can't cook and are now hungry. The mom's response seems harsh, not helping even when the author asked for assistance. The author getting mad isn't unreasonable given the circumstances. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
