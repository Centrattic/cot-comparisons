My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and their mom didn't teach them. They worked late, expected dinner, but mom told them to make it themselves. The mom says the sister, who's 14, can cook, which the author points out because the mom actually taught her. The author can't drive, so can't go to the store.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're a teenager who hasn't been taught life skills like cooking. They worked late, which is a valid reason to expect dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive. She mentions the sister, but if she taught the sister, why not the older child? The author is hungry, stressed, and maybe frustrated with constant dismissal.\n\nMom's perspective: She's the parent, and maybe she feels like the 17-year-old should be learning independence. But if she taught the 14-year-old, not teaching the older one is inconsistent. Also, the author can't drive, so going to the store isn't an option. The mom's refusal to help seems harsh when there's a clear inability to cook.\n\nConsidering typical parenting practices, teaching cooking is part of life skills. The mom didn't do that, so when the child needs it, she's not supportive. The author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and dismissed. The mom's response might be seen as neglecting her responsibility to teach. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They had a legitimate need and the mom didn't support them. The author's frustration is understandable. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
