My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 and can't cook anything except a few simple things. Their mom hasn't taught them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. They came home expecting dinner after working on prom until 7 PM, but the mom didn't cook, expecting the kid to make something. The kid can't, asks for help, but the mom insists they figure it out, even bringing up their 14-year-old sister who can cook. The kid asks to go to the store but isn't allowed, and then gets angry and goes to their room.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The mom might be trying to teach independence, but the kid hasn't been taught. At 17, maybe they should have some life skills, but if the mom never taught them and doesn't trust them, that's a problem. The kid worked late, expected dinner, and when it's not there, they can't make it. The mom's response seems dismissive. The sister being able to cook at 14 suggests the mom could have taught the kid earlier. The kid's frustration is valid because they were set up to fail. So maybe the mom is in the wrong for not providing the necessary skills. The kid might be in the right for getting upset after being unsupported. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong). But need to check if the kid should have known better or if the mom's actions are reasonable. If the mom never taught them, it's unfair to expect them to cook. So the answer is B.\n"
