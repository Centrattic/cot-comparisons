My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They provided the Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) post where the author is upset with their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and when they got home, their mom said they should figure it out. The author got mad and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 17, can't cook, and expected dinner. Their mom didn't teach them, and when asked for help, the mom said they should figure it out. The author is frustrated because they feel abandoned and unprepared. The mom's response is to push them to be independent, maybe to avoid doing the cooking herself.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want others' thoughts. So, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong for getting angry. \n\nOn one hand, 17 is still a teenager. Parents typically are responsible for providing meals until the child is an adult. The mom not teaching the child to cook might be neglecting a responsibility. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014they're tired, hungry, and have no skills. The mom's refusal to help or take them to the store could be seen as not supporting them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is getting angry and storming off instead of solving the problem. Maybe they should have found another way to handle the situation, like making a simple meal if possible. But given their lack of skills, it's hard. The mom has a responsibility to ensure the child's basic needs are met, even if they're old. \n\nThe key points: The mom didn't teach cooking, the author is dependent, and the mom's response is to push them to be independent when they can't. The argument is about responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong because the mom is the one who didn't provide necessary skills. However, the author's reaction (getting angry, not trying to resolve it) could be seen as immature. \n\nBut since the mom is the parent, she's supposed to handle such situations. The author's frustration is a result of the mom's prior neglect. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But some might say the author should have handled it better. However, the core issue is the mom's responsibility. So the author is justified in being upset.\n"
