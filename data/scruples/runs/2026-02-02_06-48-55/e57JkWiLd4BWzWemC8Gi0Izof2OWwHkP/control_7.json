My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is 17 and can't cook anything except a few simple things. They came home from working on prom decorations until 7 PM expecting dinner, but their mom said they should just cook something. The mom didn't teach them how to cook, and when they said they couldn't, the mom made them figure it out. The person got mad and went to their room.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is 17, still pretty young. Their mom never taught them to cook and now expects them to just do it on their own. The mom also mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying that the author should be able to too. But the author can't use the stove properly. The mom also refuses to drive them to the store to buy something simple because they already have ingredients.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, they were working late and expected dinner. The mom didn't set any expectations that they had to cook. The fact that the mom didn't teach them cooking and now expects them to just figure it out might be the issue. Also, the sister was taught, so there's a double standard. The author is in a tough spot because they can't drive either, so they can't get help. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author getting frustrated is understandable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The mom should have either cooked dinner or helped them prepare something. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without options. So answer B.\n"
