My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the author is 17, can't cook, and when they get home from school expecting dinner, their mom says to just find something to cook. The author argues that their mom never taught them, and they can't use the stove properly. The mom responds by saying the sister (14) can cook and that the author should figure it out. The author gets mad and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're 17, can't cook, didn't get any training from their mom. They worked late on prom decorations, probably expected dinner. The mom's perspective: maybe she's encouraging independence, or maybe she's being neglectful. \n\nThe author says they were working until 7 pm, so maybe they're tired and just want food. If the mom is the one who usually cooks, then expecting a 17-year-old to cook without prior instruction might be unreasonable. On the other hand, the mom might be trying to teach them life skills. But if the author has never been taught, then the mom isn't helping. \n\nAlso, the author mentions their younger sister can cook, which suggests the mom did teach one child but not the other. That could be unfair. The author can't drive, so they can't go to the store themselves. The mom refuses to take them, even though they need groceries. \n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated because they're hungry and can't make their own food. The mom seems dismissive, not addressing the root problem. The author's anger might be justified if they've never been taught. But maybe the author should have asked for help earlier instead of getting angry. \n\nHowever, the mom's response doesn't help. If the author can't cook, then the mom's solution is inadequate. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting some support. So maybe the mom is at fault for not teaching them and not providing a viable solution. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author got mad and went to their room. Maybe they should have handled it differently, like asking for help earlier instead of snapping. But considering the lack of prior instruction, maybe their frustration is valid. \n\nI think the key points are that the mom didn't teach them, and the author was left hungry without options. The author's anger stems from a legitimate lack of skills provided by the parent. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
