My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17 and can't cook, which is pretty common for that age. Their mom didn't teach them, and now they're home from school late, expecting dinner. The mom didn't cook and told them to figure it out. The user got mad and went to their room.\n\nFirst, the user's frustration is understandable. They\u2019re young, haven't been taught cooking skills, and after a long day of work, they just want food. The mom's response seems dismissive. She points out the sister, who is 14 and can cook, which might add to the user's feeling of being neglected. The user is asking for help, like going to the store, but the mom refuses. \n\nHowever, the user is 17, so the mom might be trying to push them to be more independent. But the user isn't being unreasonable by expecting some support, especially since they're still learning. The mom's refusal to help them get food they can cook might be part of the problem. The user didn't lash out physically or say something hurtful, just expressed frustration and left. \n\nOn the other hand, the user could have tried to find a solution on their own, but they were asking for help. The mom's response doesn't provide any support, which is the issue here. The user isn't in the wrong for being upset when they're not getting the help they need. The mom's actions and words seem to contribute to the conflict. So the answer should be B.\n"
