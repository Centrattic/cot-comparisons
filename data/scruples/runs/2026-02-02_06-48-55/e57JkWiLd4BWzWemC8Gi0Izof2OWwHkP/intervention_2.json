My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is at fault. The person is 17 years old, can't cook, and got mad at their mom for not providing dinner. The mom didn't cook for them, expecting them to use the available ingredients or buy something. The person argues that their mom never taught them how to cook, and even their younger sister, who's 14, can do it because she was taught. The mom seems to be pushing responsibility onto the 17-year-old, but there's a history of not teaching them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical expectations for a 17-year-old. At that age, many people are starting to learn life skills, but if the parent hasn't taught them, it's not entirely the kid's fault. The mom's response was dismissive, not helpful. She made excuses instead of helping. The kid is hungry, tired from school work, and just wants dinner. They asked for help, but the mom refused, even driving, which the kid can't do. \n\nThe kid's frustration is understandable. They're in a situation where they can't cook, and the parent hasn't provided the necessary skills. The mom's attitude might be contributing to the problem. While the kid could have tried to find a solution on their own, the lack of prior teaching is on the parent. So maybe the kid isn't entirely at fault here. They're reacting to a lack of support. The mom should have either taught them or arranged for them to get food. The kid's anger is a result of the parent's failure to prepare them for independence. Therefore, the kid isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
