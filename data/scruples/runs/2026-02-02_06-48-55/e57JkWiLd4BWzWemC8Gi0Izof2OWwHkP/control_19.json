My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home late from school, expected dinner, but mom said they should figure it out. The author feels frustrated and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and expectations. At 17, some level of independence is expected, but cooking isn't something everyone learns at home. If the mom never taught them and also didn't let them drive to get food, the author might be in a tough spot. They can only make very simple things like ramen. \n\nMom's response is to tell them to be creative, but the author is genuinely unable to cook. The mom mentions the sister, 14, who was taught. The author is asking for help, like being driven to the store, but the mom refuses. The author gets fed up and goes to their room, feeling hungry. \n\nSo, the key points: Did the mom have a responsibility to provide dinner when the author can't cook? Is the author being unreasonable for expecting that? Or is the mom being unreasonable by not providing support or teaching them earlier? The author's anger is a reaction to being left without food when they lack the skills. The mom's refusal to help (no driving and no cooking lessons) might contribute to the problem. \n\nBalancing both sides, it's a common issue in families where kids aren't taught life skills. The author's frustration is valid if they're not given the tools to be independent. Mom might be trying to push them, but if she hasn't provided any means (skills or access to transportation), that's a problem. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They didn't ask for dinner to be made for them, but they're in a situation where they can't help themselves, and the mom isn't offering solutions. The argument arises from unmet needs and lack of preparation.\n"
