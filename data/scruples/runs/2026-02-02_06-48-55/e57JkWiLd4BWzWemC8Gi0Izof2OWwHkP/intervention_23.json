My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook much, and after a long day at school, expected dinner but their mom said to cook something themselves. The mom mentions that they have a 14-year-old sister who cooks her own meals, and the author can't even drive to buy pre-made food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they've never been taught how to cook, can't use the stove well, and are expected to figure it out. They were working until 7 PM, probably tired and hungry, and their mom is being dismissive. The mom's perspective: the author is 17 and should be learning to cook, especially since the sister does it. She's not buying food because they already have supplies, and she's not trusting the author to drive, which is a common parent issue with teens.\n\nThe author is in the wrong if they expected their mom to always cook for them without learning. At 17, it's reasonable to start learning basic cooking skills, especially since the sister is doing it at 14. The mom is trying to encourage independence. But is it wrong to get mad when they're not able to cook and are left without food? The author is frustrated because they lack the skills, which the mom never taught. However, the author should have taken the initiative to learn earlier. The mom's refusal to help might be part of a pattern where she's not equipping them with necessary life skills, but the author is still responsible for their own actions.\n\nThe argument is that the author didn't take responsibility for learning to cook. If they wanted to be able to make their own meals, they should have asked for help before. Now that they're in a situation where the mom is pushing them to learn, they're upset. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not learning earlier. However, the mom could have been more supportive. If the author couldn't use the stove, maybe the mom should have given some basic instructions instead of just telling them to figure it out.\n\nBut the key point is the author's age and the fact that the sister is cooking on her own. The mom might feel it's time for the author to start learning, even if it's challenging. The author's anger in this situation might be justified due to hunger and frustration, but the underlying issue is their lack of self-sufficiency. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's a learning curve. The mom's approach could be better, but the author also needs to take steps to learn cooking. The answer could be a B, not in the wrong, because the mom's responsibility was to teach, and the author is reacting to being left without options. But some might argue that the author should have learned earlier, making it A. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong based on the scenario.\n"
