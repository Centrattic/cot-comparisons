My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook anything beyond basic stuff, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home late from school expecting dinner but their mom told them to make their own food. The author argues that they weren't taught how to cook and that their sister, who's 14, was taught. The mom isn't buying them food even though there's stuff in the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side is that they were never taught to cook, so expecting them to make dinner is unreasonable. The mom's side might be that the child should be learning some independence at 17. But the author is also a minor, still dependent on their parents. However, the mom didn't teach them, so maybe she's contributing to the problem. The key points are the lack of teaching and the sudden expectation to cook when the author isn't capable. The author's frustration is valid because they were set up to fail. The mom's response seems dismissive. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
