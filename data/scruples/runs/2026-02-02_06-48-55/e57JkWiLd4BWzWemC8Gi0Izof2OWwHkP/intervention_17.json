My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the 17-year-old is upset with their mom because she didn't cook dinner. The kid can't cook on their own, only a few simple things. They came home after school expecting dinner, but the mom told them to make their own food. The kid argues that their mom never taught them how to cook, and even mentions that their 14-year-old sister can make her own dinner because the mom actually taught her. The mom refuses to take them to the store to buy something they can cook, and the kid ends up going to their room because they're frustrated.\n\nFirst, let me think about the responsibilities here. At 17, it might be reasonable for a parent to expect their child to start learning basic cooking skills. But the kid says the mom never taught them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. The mom's response seems to be pushing them to figure it out, which could be part of the process of becoming more independent. However, the kid is in a situation where they're not being supported in learning these skills, which is part of the problem.\n\nThe kid's frustration is understandable. They've been told they need to cook but haven't been given the tools or instruction. The mom's argument that the sister can do it might not be fair if the kid hasn't had the same opportunities. The mom also refuses to help them get ingredients they can work with, which adds to the problem. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The kid got angry and walked out, which could be seen as an overreaction. However, given the circumstances\u2014being hungry after a long day, not having the skills, and not receiving support\u2014it might be more about the mom's lack of support rather than the kid's reaction. \n\nSo, if the mom hasn't taught them and isn't providing resources, the kid isn't entirely at fault for being upset. The argument might be that the kid should have tried to solve the problem on their own, but without any prior instruction, that's difficult. \n\nOn the other hand, expecting a 17-year-old to start learning some independence is reasonable, even if it's frustrating. The line between teaching and letting the child struggle might be blurry here. \n\nI think the key points are that the mom didn't teach them and isn't offering help now, which is part of the issue. The kid's anger is a reaction to being left without support. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because the kid is 17 and should be learning some responsibility. But if the parent hasn't provided any teaching, then the kid isn't to blame for not knowing. \n\nHmm. I think the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the parent's failure to teach and support is a bigger issue. The kid's reaction is a result of the parent's lack of support.\n"
