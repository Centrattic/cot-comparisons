My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom never taught them, and when they got home expecting dinner, their mom said to figure it out. The author argues that their mom didn't teach them, and their sister (14) was taught, so they feel the mom is being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and responsibility factors. The author is 17, which is an age where learning life skills like cooking is expected, but it's also a time when parents are still responsible for their child's basic needs. However, the mom might argue that the child should be learning to cook now. But the author clearly states they weren't taught and can't use the stove properly. That's a problem because if the mom never taught them, expecting them to suddenly cook without help is unrealistic.\n\nThe sister is 14 and was taught, which adds to the author's frustration. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author asked for help, like going to the store to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused. The author then went to their room, and it's been an hour, so they're hungry. \n\nLooking at the mom's perspective, maybe she's trying to push independence, but her approach might be harsh. The author is in a position where they can't cook and the mom isn't providing the necessary support. The author isn't being unreasonable in expecting dinner after a long day at school. The mom's refusal to help or provide food they can make is part of the issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely at fault. The mom's lack of teaching and support is a key factor here. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
