My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, hasn't been taught, and their mom isn't helping. The mom says they should figure it out, and there's a sister who's younger but already cooking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager. They haven't been taught cooking skills, and their mom isn't teaching them. The mom's response is to say that the author should just figure it out. The author is frustrated because they can't use the stove properly and are left without dinner. The mom also mentions that the younger sister can cook, implying that maybe the author should have been taught as well.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're expecting dinner after a long day at school. Their mom isn't providing it, and instead of helping, she's pushing them to do it themselves. The author is in a situation where they lack the skills, and their mom isn't supporting them. However, the author is 17, which is an age where some level of independence is expected. The mom might be trying to encourage self-sufficiency, even if it's causing stress now.\n\nThe mom's point about the sister being 14 and cooking her own dinner suggests that maybe the mom did teach the sister, and perhaps the author wasn't given the same opportunity. That could indicate a double standard. But maybe the author had different opportunities or the mom thought the author didn't need to learn for some reason.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable because they're hungry and frustrated. But maybe they should have taken initiative earlier, like learning basic cooking skills before relying on the mom. However, the mom's responsibility might be to teach the child, not just expect them to learn on their own.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is 17 and hasn't learned to cook, which might be a gap in the mom's parenting. The mom's response of not helping and saying to figure it out could be seen as dismissive. The author is in a position where they can't help themselves, which is a problem if the mom isn't stepping in.\n\nBut the author could also be taking responsibility. For example, maybe they should have asked for instruction earlier or found a way to get help. However, if the mom has never taught them and refuses to do so now, that's a different issue. The author is in a bind where they lack the skills and the support to gain them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They're in a situation where their needs aren't being met, and the mom isn't providing necessary support. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner and without the skills to fix it. The mom's approach might be fostering independence, but it's causing immediate harm. Therefore, the author's frustration is justified, and the mom might be at fault for not providing the necessary skills or alternatives.\n\nBut I need to check if the author is overstepping. Getting angry might be a natural reaction, but maybe they should have handled it differently. However, the core issue is the lack of support from the mom. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about not being taught, especially if the mom is responsible for that. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
