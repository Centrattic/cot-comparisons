My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The scenario is that the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. When they got home expecting dinner, the mom said to find something to cook, but the author can't. The mom also mentions their 14-year-old sister can cook, which the author points out she was actually taught. The author asks to be driven to the store but the mom refuses. They ended up upset and hungry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're 17, haven't been taught cooking, and rely on the mom for meals. Now they're in a situation where they have to cook or figure it out, but they can't. The mom's perspective: maybe she's trying to teach independence, or perhaps she's overwhelmed and not realizing the author's lack of skills. The sister being 14 and cooking might indicate the mom did teach the sister, so maybe there's inconsistency.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable because they're hungry and stressed from working on prom. But are they in the wrong? If the mom never taught them, expecting a 17-year-old to suddenly cook without any guidance might be unreasonable. However, the author could have tried to learn earlier instead of waiting until they needed it. The mom might also need to recognize that not teaching the child to cook is part of her responsibility.\n\nBut the situation seems more about the mom not fulfilling her role in teaching necessary life skills. The author's frustration is valid. They're in a dependent position, and the mom's refusal to help when there's a lack of skills could make the author in the right. However, maybe the author should have communicated earlier or found a way to learn cooking on their own. But given the age and the fact that the mom didn't teach them, it's not entirely the author's fault. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
