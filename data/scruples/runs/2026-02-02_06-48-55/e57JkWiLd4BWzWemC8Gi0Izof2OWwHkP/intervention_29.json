My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the kid getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner because they can't cook. The kid is 17, hasn't been taught how to cook, and relied on the mom to make dinner. The mom says they have stuff to cook with and tells the kid to be creative. The kid argues they can't cook, mentions the sister was taught, and wants to buy something to cook but the mom refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the responsibilities here. The kid is 17, which is an age where some independence is expected, but they haven't been taught cooking. The mom might be responsible for not teaching them earlier. On the other hand, the kid is expecting their mom to still provide meals when they get home after a long day. The mom's response seems to push the kid to learn, but without actual teaching. The kid is frustrated because they genuinely can't cook, which is a valid point. The mom's argument that the sister can cook might not apply if the sister was explicitly taught. The kid's reaction of getting angry and going to their room could be seen as lashing out, but their frustration is understandable given the lack of skills. The question is whether the kid is in the wrong. \n\nPossible angles: The mom's responsibility to teach vs. the kid's expectation to be provided for. If the mom never taught, then she's at fault. But the kid is now expecting the mom to still make dinner, so maybe they are both at fault. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user's reasoning might be that the kid should have learned earlier or is being entitled. But the kid's inability to cook is a key factor. In AITA scenarios, it's often about empathy. The kid's frustration is justified if they really can't cook and the mom isn't helping. So maybe the kid isn't in the wrong. But the kid's reaction (getting mad and storming off) could be too harsh. \n\nThe answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Considering the mom's role in not teaching and the kid's lack of skills, the kid's anger is understandable. The mom is being unhelpful. So the answer might be B. But maybe some would say the kid is too dependent. However, the kid is 17 and hasn't been taught, so it's the mom's responsibility. Therefore, the author (the kid) is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
