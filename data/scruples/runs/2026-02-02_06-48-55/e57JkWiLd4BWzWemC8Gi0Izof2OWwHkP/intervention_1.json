My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 17-year-old who can't cook, blames their mom for not teaching them, and then gets mad when she doesn't provide dinner. The mom says there are ingredients and that the author should figure it out, especially since the sister can cook and they can't drive.\n\nFirst, the author's arguments: They can't cook, were never taught, and are expected to use the stove. They were working on prom until 7 PM and expected dinner. The mom's response is to tell them to find something and not to buy food. The author then gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nNow, considering the ages. The author is 17, and the sister is 14. If the 14-year-old can cook, maybe the mom has been teaching her earlier. But the author wasn't taught. That's a problem because parents usually teach kids some basic skills. However, 17 is an age where parents might start expecting independence, but not everyone learns how to cook that young. Especially if the mom didn't teach.\n\nThe author was working on prom, so they might be busy. The mom didn't prepare dinner, which the author expected. But the mom might have assumed the author could use the ingredients. However, if the author truly can't cook anything beyond simple things, then the mom should have either taught them earlier or arranged for dinner. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable because they were hungry and didn't know how to fix the situation. But expecting a parent to drop everything to buy food or cook when they already have ingredients might be a stretch. The author's frustration is valid because they weren't given the tools to be independent. However, getting mad and giving up instead of trying to make something simple (like the grilled cheese) might be seen as their fault. But if they can't even do that, then the mom's responsibility is in question.\n\nI think the key points are: the mom didn't teach, the author is 17 but can't cook, the mom expects them to use what's there. The author's anger is justified because they were left without dinner despite being unable to cook. The mom should have either taught them earlier or made sure they had something pre-cooked. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might say they should have tried to make the grilled cheese. However, the author mentions detailed instructions are welcome, which suggests they don't know how. So the mom's responsibility is higher here. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
