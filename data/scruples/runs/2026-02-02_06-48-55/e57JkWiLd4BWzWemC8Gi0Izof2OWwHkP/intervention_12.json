My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom never taught them, and they're 17. They came home expecting dinner, but their mom told them to make something themselves. The mom also mentions their 14-year-old sister can cook, and she doesn't trust the author to drive to buy food.\n\nSo, the author is upset because they can't cook and their mom isn't helping. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author is 17, which is a teenager, and maybe the mom expects them to start learning life skills like cooking. But the author isn't being taught and can't drive, so they can't go buy food. The mom seems to be not supporting them in learning these skills, which is part of the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is reacting in anger instead of trying to find a solution. Maybe they should have communicated better or tried to ask for help in a calmer way. However, the mom isn't providing the necessary guidance. The author's frustration is understandable given that they've never been taught and are left to figure it out on their own. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the mom is the one not teaching and not allowing them to get food, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. But the author did get angry and went to their room, which might be seen as not handling the situation maturely. However, considering the mom's lack of support, the author's reaction is a result of being left without resources. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They're in a tough spot because their mom isn't helping them become independent. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Maybe the key is whether the author is overreacting. Even though the mom isn't helping, throwing a tantrum isn't the best approach. But the author is 17, and their request was denied multiple times. The sister is 14 and can cook, which the mom uses as a comparison. The author is left hungry and frustrated. \n\nIn AITA posts, the balance is usually between both parties. But the main question is if the author is in the wrong. The author's anger is a reaction to being unsupported. The mom is failing to teach and provide resources. The author is left in a bind. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mom is the one not providing necessary support, and the author is reacting to that. The author isn't at fault for being hungry and upset when their parents aren't helping them learn basic skills.\n"
