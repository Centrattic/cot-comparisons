My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. They're 17 and can't cook, only simple things. Their mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them with the stove. They came home late from school expecting dinner, but mom said they had to make it themselves. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister who can cook, and the author tried to ask for help but mom refused. They got fed up and went to their room.\n\nHmm. So, the author is an adult in the eyes of the law, but still a teenager. They can't cook, which is a basic life skill. The mom's side is that the child is old enough to learn, and they taught their younger sister. But the author hasn't been taught. The mom seems to be expecting the child to figure it out, but the author isn't able to. The author got angry and argumentative, which led to them not having dinner.\n\nOn one hand, the mom isn't providing a skill the child needs, so maybe she's not helping them become independent. But on the other hand, the child is 17, and maybe it's time they learned. But the author is in a situation where they can't cook and the mom isn't helping. The author's anger is understandable because they're hungry and have been neglected. The mom's response is dismissive, not offering support. The author is asking for help, like being driven to the store, but mom says no. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're expressing frustration, but maybe they should have approached it differently. However, the root issue is that the mom hasn't taught them, and now is expecting them to handle it. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The mom might share responsibility here. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The author could be seen as being ungrateful, but if they weren't taught, then they can't help it. So probably B.\n"
