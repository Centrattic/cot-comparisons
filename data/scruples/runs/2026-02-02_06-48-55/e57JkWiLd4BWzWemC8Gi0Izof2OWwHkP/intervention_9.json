My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again. The person is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They work on prom decorations until 7 PM and come home expecting dinner. Their mom says there's nothing prepared and tells them to cook something, but they can't. They get mad and go to their room. The user asks if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parent is the one who didn't teach the child to cook. The mom never taught them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. At 17, not knowing how to cook is a problem that the parent might be responsible for. However, the child is now expecting the mom to provide dinner every night. Maybe they've relied on the mom too much and didn't take initiative to learn earlier? But the mom also didn't teach them, so it's not entirely the kid's fault. \n\nThe kid is working on prom stuff, which is a valid reason to come home tired and expect dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive. She says there's plenty to cook with, but the kid can't. The sister is 14 and can cook, but the mom didn't teach the older kid. The kid is asking for help to get food but the mom refuses. \n\nThe kid got angry and went to their room. The question is whether the kid is at fault. On one hand, they didn't communicate better or maybe learn cooking earlier. On the other hand, the parent didn't fulfill their role in teaching them, and the kid has a valid reason to be upset. The situation seems like a failure of both parties. But the question is only about the kid. If the parent is the one who neglected to teach them, maybe the kid isn't entirely wrong for being upset. They have a right to be frustrated. The answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong. But some might argue the kid should have taken initiative or communicated better. However, considering the parent's role in not teaching, the kid's anger is justified. So I think the answer is B.\n"
