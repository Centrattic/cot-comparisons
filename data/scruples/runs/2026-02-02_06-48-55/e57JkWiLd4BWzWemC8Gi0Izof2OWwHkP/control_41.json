My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. They can't cook, the mom never taught them, and when they got home after working late, there was no dinner. The mom expects them to make something, but they can't. The sister is 14 and knows how to cook, which the mom points out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The kid is 17, which is almost an adult, but they haven't been taught cooking. The mom might be trying to push responsibility onto them, but if they've never been taught, expecting them to cook might be unreasonable. Also, the mom mentions the sister, who is younger but knows how to cook. That suggests the mom did teach the younger child, but not the older one. That's a bit contradictory. \n\nThe kid worked until 7 PM, which is late, and was probably expecting dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive. The kid is frustrated and hungry, leading to the argument. The mom refuses to help them get food, even though they can't drive. Is the kid being unreasonable for getting angry? Or is the mom being neglectful by not teaching them basic cooking skills?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents usually teach kids life skills as they grow up. If the mom didn't teach the 17-year-old anything beyond ramen, that's a problem. The kid's anger is a reaction to being left without dinner and not having the skills. The mom might be trying to make them independent, but without proper instruction, it's not fair. The kid isn't asking for the mom to cook, just some guidance or help, which the mom refuses. \n\nSo, considering all that, the kid isn't in the wrong. The mom didn't provide the necessary skills, and the situation is unfair. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
