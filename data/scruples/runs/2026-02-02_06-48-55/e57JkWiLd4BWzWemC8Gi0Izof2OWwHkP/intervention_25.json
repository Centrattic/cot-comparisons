My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault here. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook and hasn't been taught, they're 17, and after coming home late from school, expected dinner but mom told them to figure it out. The author's sister, who's 14, can cook, and the mom didn't teach the author. The author got frustrated and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the person. At 17, depending on cultural norms, some might expect a teenager to start learning life skills like cooking, but others might still see them as dependent. The mom's argument is that the author should \"figure it out\" even though they weren't taught. The sister was taught, so maybe there's inconsistency in how the parents handle teaching their kids.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they didn't have the skills provided. They tried to ask for help, like going to the store, but the mom refused. The argument might be that the author is being unreasonable to expect dinner without having learned how to cook, but also the mom might be neglecting her responsibility in teaching necessary skills. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the mom never taught the child to cook, then expecting them to cook without prior instruction could be unreasonable. However, at 17, some might argue the child should have started learning earlier. The author's anger might stem from being put in a situation where they're expected to perform a task they weren't ever taught. The sister being able to cook adds to the perceived unfairness.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014getting mad and going to their room\u2014might be seen as a reaction to feeling unsupported. They\u2019re in a bind: hungry, unable to cook, and mom isn't helping. The question is whether the author is at fault for being upset. If the mom hadn't taught them, then the author isn't entirely wrong. However, maybe they should have communicated better earlier, but the immediate situation is about not having dinner after a long day. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mom's responsibility in not teaching them might be the main issue here. The argument could be that the author is a victim of the mom's neglect in teaching essential skills. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might think that at 17, they should have learned to cook by then, making them partly responsible. However, given the mom's role in not providing that education, the balance tips towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
