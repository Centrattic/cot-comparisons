My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who gets angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid can't cook, hasn't been taught, and the mom says they should figure it out. The kid argues that they can't, and the mom points out that their 14-year-old sister can. The kid wants to go to the store but can't drive. They end up going to their room, and the question is whether the kid is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kid's perspective. At 17, they're young and maybe still dependent on their parents. If they haven't been taught how to cook, they might be in a tough spot. The mom's response seems dismissive, not helpful. She's not offering to teach them, just telling them to figure it out. The kid is working on prom decorations, which shows some responsibility, but they're also just trying to get a meal. The mom's sister can cook, but maybe she was taught, which the kid wasn't. The kid is asking for help, like driving them to the store, but the mom refuses. \n\nFrom the mom's side, maybe she's trying to encourage independence. But if the kid hasn't been taught, expecting them to just figure it out might be unrealistic. At 17, some level of independence is expected, but cooking is a skill that needs to be learned. The mom might be neglecting her responsibility to teach the child a necessary life skill. \n\nThe kid's anger might be justified if they've repeatedly asked to be taught and the mom hasn't helped. However, getting mad and walking away could be seen as not handling the situation maturely. The kid could have tried a different approach, like offering to learn or finding another solution. But the mom's lack of support is definitely a problem here. \n\nThe question is whether the kid is in the wrong. The kid is reacting to a situation where they're not equipped to handle the task (cooking) and the parent isn't providing the necessary education. The mom's refusal to assist or teach might be the bigger issue. The kid's frustration is understandable if they've been denied the chance to learn. So, maybe the kid isn't in the wrong. But they could have handled it better. \n\nHowever, the title says \"AITA for getting mad at my mom...\" which implies the kid is questioning their own reaction. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parent is failing to teach a necessary skill. The kid's anger is a response to being left in a difficult situation without support. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B, the kid isn't in the wrong because the parent didn't teach them how to cook, and expecting a 17-year-old to figure it out without guidance is unreasonable. The kid is seeking help, which the mom isn't providing, leading to frustration.\n"
