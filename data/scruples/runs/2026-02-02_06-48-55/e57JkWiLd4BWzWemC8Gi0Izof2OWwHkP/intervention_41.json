My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The scenario is that the author is 17, can't cook, and their mom expects them to figure it out. The author tried to get help but was denied, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom's perspective: she's not cooking dinner, maybe because she expects her kid to be responsible. She mentions the sister is 14 and can cook, so maybe she's trying to teach independence. But the author is 17, which is old enough to start learning, but the mom never taught them. The author can't drive, so can't get groceries, and the mom won't take them. The author feels abandoned because they can't cook anything beyond basics.\n\nOn the author's side, they're clearly frustrated. Being 17 and not knowing how to cook more than a few items is a problem, but it's the mom's responsibility to teach. The argument is the mom refusing to help, which leaves the kid hungry. The author's anger might be justified because they were set up to fail. The mom didn't teach them, then expects them to cook, and refuses to help when they can't.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting angry? Maybe they should have asked for help earlier or learned on their own. However, the mom never taught them, so the kid isn't at fault for not knowing. The mom's refusal to assist or drive them to the store exacerbates the situation. The author's anger stems from being unable to meet the mom's expectations without prior support. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the mom is the one who didn't provide the necessary skills or support. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
