My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nSo, the author is 17, can't cook, and after coming home from school work until 7 PM, expects dinner. The mom says they should \"get creative\" with cooking, but the author can't. The mom mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying she taught her, but the author wasn't taught. The author then asks to go to the store but the mom refuses, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're young, haven't been taught basic cooking skills, and after a long day, expected a meal. The mom's perspective: maybe she's trying to teach independence, but perhaps she's not providing the necessary support. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did get angry and left the room. But their anger comes from not being able to cook and not being taught. If the mom is responsible for teaching basic life skills, then she's at fault. However, 17 is an age where some level of independence is expected. But the author is still a minor and might rely on parents for meals. \n\nThe mom's response seems dismissive. She didn't offer help or solutions, just said to figure it out. The sister was taught, but the author wasn't. That's a point against the mom. Also, the author asked for help going to the store but was refused. \n\nSo, the author's anger is understandable given the situation. They didn't have the skills and were left without a meal. The mom didn't provide the necessary support. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
