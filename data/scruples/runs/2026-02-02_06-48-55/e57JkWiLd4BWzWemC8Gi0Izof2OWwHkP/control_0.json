My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The kid can't cook beyond a few things, and the mom isn't helping, even though the kid is home from school late. The sister is mentioned as being 14 and cooking herself, but the mom taught her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and responsibility. 17 is still pretty young, and while some teens might be more independent, the mom hasn't taught the kid how to cook. The kid is asking for help, like being driven to the store or some guidance, but the mom is refusing. The sister is 14 and already cooking, so maybe that's a point in the mom's favor, but she did teach the sister. The kid feels they can't cook anything else. \n\nIs the kid being unreasonable? Maybe not. They can't cook much, and the mom hasn't provided any instruction. The kid is working on a school project until 7 PM, expecting dinner. The mom's response is dismissive. The kid's frustration is valid because they're hungry and can't fix a meal. The mom's refusal to help might be contributing to the problem. \n\nOn the flip side, the mom might be trying to encourage independence, which is important. But if the kid hasn't been taught, the mom might still be responsible for providing meals or at least the resources. The kid is asking for something simple like a grilled cheese and even instructions. The mom's insistence that the kid \"figure it out\" could be seen as neglectful, especially if the kid hasn't been taught. \n\nThe sister was taught, so the mom isn't incapable of teaching. The kid's anger might stem from feeling unsupported. The kid isn't being a brat; they're asking for help that the mom hasn't provided. So the kid isn't in the wrong. The mom's actions might be the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
