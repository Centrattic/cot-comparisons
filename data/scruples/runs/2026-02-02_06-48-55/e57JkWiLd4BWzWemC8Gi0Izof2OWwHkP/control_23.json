My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, is upset with their mom for not cooking dinner. They can't cook themselves because the mom never taught them. They came home after working on prom decorations until 7 PM and expected dinner. The mom told them to figure it out, and the author got angry and went to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. At 17, some level of independence is expected, but the author explicitly states they can't cook beyond very simple things. The mom hasn't taught them, and there's a history of not trusting them with the stove or driving. The sister is 14 but was taught how to cook, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nIs it reasonable to expect a 17-year-old to cook? Well, some people might learn earlier, but if the parent hasn't taught them, it's not the kid's fault. The author is in a situation where they can't prepare a meal on their own, and the mom is not offering help, even though there's a younger sister who can. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author is hungry and worked hard that day, so their frustration is understandable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for getting mad? Maybe they should have tried to communicate better earlier, but the situation is that they were left without dinner. The mom's refusal to help or take them to the store (since they can't drive) leaves them without options. The author's anger might be justified because they were set up to fail. The mom's responsibility could be questioned here for not teaching them to cook or providing support when needed.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that at 17, the author should have started learning, but if the parent hasn't taught them, the responsibility isn't on the kid. The mom's response of \"you can figure it out\" might be unrealistic given the circumstances. The author isn't being unreasonable in their request for help. The sister was taught, so the author's expectation isn't unfounded.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's frustration is valid. They were left without dinner, couldn't cook, and the mom didn't provide the necessary support. The answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B). The mom's lack of teaching and support is the issue here.\n"
