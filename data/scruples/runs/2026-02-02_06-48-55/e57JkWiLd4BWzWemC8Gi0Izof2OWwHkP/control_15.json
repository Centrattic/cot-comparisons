My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, so they're a teenager. They mention they can't cook anything except a few basic things. Their mom didn't teach them, and she doesn't trust them to learn on their own. The author worked late at school and expected dinner but the mom said to make something themselves. The author can't, leading to an argument and them storming off.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the mom didn't teach the child to cook, the child is now in a situation where they need to cook but can't, and the mom is expecting the child to figure it out. The child is also not allowed to drive, so they can't even buy food. The mom uses the example of the sister, who is 14 and was taught how to cook. The sister can't even drive yet, but the mom taught her cooking. The author is frustrated because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nConsidering that the mom didn't teach the child to cook, and the child is now in a situation where they have to cook, but can't. The mom expects them to figure it out. However, the child is 17, which is still under 18. At that age, depending on the culture, some parents might be teaching their kids to cook, but others might not. The author's mom didn't teach them, so the child's inability isn't their fault. The mom is now expecting them to cook, which isn't possible without prior instruction. \n\nThe author is also working on prom decorations until 7, which is a valid reason to be hungry and expecting dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive. The sister being able to cook was because the mom taught her, so it's not like the sister learned on her own. The author is asking for help, even offering to go to the store with the mom, but the mom refuses. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without options and not being supported. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated. The mom didn't provide the necessary skills, and the author is in a situation where they can't cook. The author's response is understandable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
