My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook and got upset with their mom because she didn't make dinner. The mom expects them to cook using available ingredients, but the kid hasn't been taught. The mom mentions that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying she taught the sister but not the older child. The kid can't drive, so they can't get groceries themselves.\n\nFirst, the mom's responsibility: teaching kids basic life skills like cooking is part of parenting. The user wasn't taught and now can't cook, which the mom acknowledges by saying the sister was taught. So the mom might be at fault for not teaching the older child. The kid is 17, which is old enough to learn, but if the mom didn't teach them, they can't be blamed for not knowing.\n\nThe mom's response seems dismissive. Saying \"you can figure it out\" when the kid clearly can't is unhelpful. The kid is in a tough spot because they lack the necessary skills and resources (no driving, no cooking knowledge). The mom's refusal to help them buy pre-cooked food adds to the problem.\n\nThe argument is about unmet expectations. The kid expected dinner after a long day, but the mom didn't prepare it. The kid's anger stems from being unprepared and not having the skills to fix the situation. The mom's reaction might have been the trigger, but the root issue is the lack of prior teaching.\n\nConsidering all this, the kid isn't in the wrong. They didn't ask to be put in this situation without the necessary skills. The mom is responsible for teaching them, and the kid is reacting to her failure to do so. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
