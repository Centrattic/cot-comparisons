My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and now they're 17. They came home expecting dinner but their mom told them to make it themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught how to cook, so they rely on their mom. When they get home, they're probably tired from school and expecting dinner. The mom's response is pushing them to figure it out, even though the author has no experience. The mom mentions their 14-year-old sister can cook, but the author points out the mom actually taught her. The author can't drive, so they can't even go buy something they can cook. The mom refuses to buy them food, so the author gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nIs the author wrong? They expressed frustration, which is understandable given their lack of cooking skills and the situation. But did they overreact? Maybe, but considering they were told they can't drive, weren't taught, and the mom isn't helping, their anger might be justified. The mom could be seen as not supporting them in learning basic life skills. The author isn't the one who decided not to teach them, so they might not be at fault. On the other hand, being 17 and expecting someone else to always cook might be a bit much. But the mom's responsibility to teach could override that. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
