My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The key points here are the author's inability to cook, their mom's refusal to help, and the resulting frustration.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they can't cook anything beyond a few basic items. Their mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them to teach themselves. The author is 17, which is a common age where parents expect more independence, but they still haven't been taught essential life skills like cooking. When the author comes home expecting dinner and the mom offers no help, the conflict arises.\n\nThe mom's response seems to be pushing the author to fend for themselves, even though they've never been taught. She brings up the sister, who is 14, but the author can't drive, so they can't even get to the store. The mom refuses to buy food for the author, even though they have ingredients at home. The author ends up hungry and upset.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the mom's responsibility to teach basic life skills is a factor here. If the author never had the opportunity to learn cooking, expecting them to suddenly figure it out might be unfair. Parents typically have a duty to teach their children necessary skills, especially in a household. The mom's refusal to assist when the author is in a difficult situation (being hungry and unable to cook) could be seen as neglecting that duty.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might argue that the author is old enough to start learning. However, the author's lack of cooking skills and the inability to drive complicate things. The mom's response doesn't address the root problem\u2014teaching the author how to cook\u2014which could be the core issue here. The author's anger stems from frustration over not being taught and being left without a solution. \n\nSo, the author's reaction might be justified because they were in a situation where they couldn't help themselves due to lack of prior instruction. The mom's refusal to provide support in that moment could be seen as neglecting her responsibility to teach her child essential skills. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset.\n"
