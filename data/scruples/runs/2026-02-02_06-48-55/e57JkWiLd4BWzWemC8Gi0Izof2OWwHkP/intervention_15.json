My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who can't cook and gets upset with their mom for not having dinner ready. The mom expects them to cook themselves, but the kid hasn't been taught. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want the assistant's opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points here are the age of the person (17), their lack of cooking skills, and the mom's response. The person is at school until 7 PM, expecting dinner, but the mom says there's plenty to cook with. The kid can't cook anything beyond basics like ramen and chicken nuggets. The mom points out that their 14-year-old sister can cook, implying the kid should too. The kid then asks to be driven to buy something they can cook, but the mom refuses.\n\nSo, the main issue is the responsibility of the parent versus the child. At 17, there's an expectation to start learning life skills, but the parent has never taught them. The mom might be trying to push independence, but if she hasn't provided the necessary skills, that could be an issue. However, the kid is also an adult in many respects (17 is close to 18), and some might argue they should have started learning earlier.\n\nThe kid's frustration is valid because they weren't taught. The mom's response might be seen as neglecting her responsibility to teach basic life skills. On the other hand, expecting a 17-year-old to start learning some independence isn't unreasonable either. The kid is getting angry because they're hungry and can't cook, but maybe they should have communicated better earlier, or the mom should have been more proactive in teaching.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if it's a shared responsibility. The mom hasn't taught cooking, and the kid hasn't taken initiative to learn. However, the kid is in a bind because they can't cook and the mom won't help. The key question is whether the kid's anger is justified given the circumstances. If the parent has never taught cooking, then the kid's inability isn't their fault. The mom's refusal to buy ingredients or teach might be the main issue here.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, it's usually about the person's actions and if they're the one being unreasonable. Here, the kid is frustrated because they weren't taught and can't cook, leading to hunger. The mom is refusing to help, which the kid feels is unfair. Since the mom hasn't provided the necessary skills, the kid's anger might be justified. Therefore, the kid isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
