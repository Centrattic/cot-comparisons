My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and when they came home expecting dinner, their mom told them to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager but still pretty young. They mention they can't cook anything beyond basic things like ramen. Their mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them to learn on their own. When they come home late from school, expecting dinner, the mom says they should find something to cook. The author is frustrated because they don't know how and even point out their sister, who is 14, can cook. The mom insists they can figure it out and refuses to drive them to buy food. The author gets upset and goes to their room.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a valid point. They were raised in a household where cooking wasn't taught, and now they're being expected to do it without proper guidance. The mom's response seems dismissive. However, the author is 17, which is an age where they might be expected to start learning these skills. But the mom didn't provide any teaching, so expecting the child to suddenly learn without any support might not be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, getting mad and walking out might be an overreaction. Maybe they could have tried to find a compromise, like asking for help to learn. But given the lack of prior support, getting angry is understandable. The mom's refusal to drive them to the store also adds to the frustration, especially since they can't drive themselves.\n\nThe key factors here are the lack of prior teaching by the mother and the author's dependence on her for something that's now expected. The mother's response seems to be shifting responsibility without providing the necessary tools. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. They have a valid complaint about not being taught, and the mother's actions (or inaction) contributed to the situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The mother's behavior is more at fault here. The author is reacting to a situation where they weren't given the skills they needed and are being expected to handle something they weren't prepared for.\n"
