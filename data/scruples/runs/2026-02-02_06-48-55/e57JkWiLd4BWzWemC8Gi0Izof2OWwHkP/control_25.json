My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author can't cook and hasn't been taught, so when they come home expecting dinner, their mom tells them to figure it out. The author is 17, can't drive, and feels their mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom's perspective: maybe she's trying to teach independence, even though the author hasn't been taught. But the author is still a minor, 17, and hasn't been given the skills. The mom says the sister (14) can cook, but that might mean she's being compared to a sibling, which can be unfair. The author is asking if they're wrong for being upset.\n\nThe author's frustration seems valid because they're not equipped to cook. The mom's response might be neglecting their needs. However, the author did get angry and left the conversation, which could be seen as not trying to resolve it. But the root is the mom not providing necessary skills or support.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom is responsible for the child's well-being. Not teaching life skills like cooking could be a problem, especially if the child is expected to handle it. The author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared and hungry. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're not responsible for their lack of cooking skills. The mom might be at fault for not teaching them. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
