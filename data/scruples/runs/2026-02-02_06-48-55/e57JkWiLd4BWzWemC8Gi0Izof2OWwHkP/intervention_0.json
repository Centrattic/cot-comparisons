My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The person is 17, can't cook, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner, but the mom told them to figure it out. The person is frustrated because they can't cook and the mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, the person's perspective: They're a teenager who hasn't been taught to cook. Their mom expects them to cook but hasn't provided the necessary skills. They tried to find alternatives, like going to the store, but their mom refused. They ended up hungry and upset. That seems like a valid frustration. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of support from a parent, especially if they haven't been taught essential life skills.\n\nOn the mom's side, she might be trying to encourage independence. However, if the child hasn't been taught how to cook and the mom isn't allowing them to learn, that's a problem. It's one thing to foster independence, but another to leave a teenager without the tools to do so. The mom's response about the sister being 14 and able to cook is a point against her, especially since the sister was taught. The fact that the mom refuses to help with transportation to buy pre-cooked food shows a lack of support.\n\nThe key points here are that the mother hasn't provided the necessary skills or support, leading the child to be unprepared. The child is in a situation where they're expected to cook but can't, leading to frustration. The author's anger is a reaction to being left without options after not being taught. So, is the author in the wrong? It seems like the mother's lack of teaching and support is the root issue. The child is reacting to a lack of preparation, which isn't entirely their fault. However, the way they responded (getting mad and going to their room) might be seen as a bit immature, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The mother's refusal to offer help is more problematic. So, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
