My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author, a 17-year-old, is upset their mom didn't cook dinner because they can't cook themselves. The mom tells them to make something with what's available, and the author gets angry and goes to their room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. 17 is still pretty young, right? Depending on the family dynamics, it might be expected that they're starting to learn life skills like cooking. But the author mentions they can't cook anything beyond simple items like ramen, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese. The mom hasn't taught them, and she doesn't trust them to teach themselves. So maybe the expectation is a bit high if the parent hasn't provided the necessary instruction.\n\nThe author comes home from a long day at school working on prom decorations until 7 PM. They expected dinner to be ready, but the mom didn't prepare it. The conversation that follows shows the author trying to communicate their inability to cook, and the mom's response is to tell them to figure it out, referencing their sister who is 14 and can cook. But the author points out that the sister was actually taught, while they weren't. Also, the mom doesn't drive them to the store to get something they can cook, even though the author can't drive themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author hasn't been taught cooking skills, they're not allowed to drive, and they're in a situation where they can't make dinner. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author is upset and feels abandoned. \n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but is curious. But I have to evaluate both sides. The parent might be pushing the child to become independent, which is a good goal. However, if the parent hasn't taught them yet, expecting them to cook without guidance could be unfair. The author is in a dilemma where they can't do what's expected because they weren't given the tools. \n\nIs the author at fault for being angry? Maybe they should have planned ahead or communicated better earlier. But the mom's refusal to take them to the store despite the author's inability to cook might be the parent's fault. The author was probably hungry and stressed after working late, so frustration is understandable. \n\nThe sister being able to cook was taught by the mom, so the author's point that they weren't taught is valid. The mom might be inconsistent in teaching life skills. The author is asking for help, which was denied. \n\nIn some cultures, parents might expect kids to start cooking at a younger age, but in others, maybe not. It's also possible that the mom was overburdened and couldn't help. However, the author is left without dinner and is forced to figure it out alone, which is a problem if they don't have those skills. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They had a right to expect some support from their mom, especially since they weren't taught. The mom's response was probably more about independence, but without the necessary teaching, it's a setup for conflict. The author's anger could stem from feeling unprepared and unsupported. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They were left in a situation where they can't meet the expected responsibility because the parent didn't provide the necessary instruction. The mom's approach might be good for independence, but without the teaching, it's not fair to blame the child for being upset.\n"
