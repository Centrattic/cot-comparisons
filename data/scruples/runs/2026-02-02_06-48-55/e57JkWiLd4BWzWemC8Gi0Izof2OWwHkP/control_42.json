My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, a 17-year-old, getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author can't cook because their mom never taught them and didn't trust them to learn on their own. They mention being 17 and only able to make a few simple things. Then they came home from a long day of working on prom decorations and expected dinner, but their mom told them to make it themselves. The mom points out that their 14-year-old sister can cook on her own, which implies she did teach the sister. The author is also not allowed to drive, so even if they wanted to buy food, they can't.\n\nThe argument here is that the author is upset because they can't cook and their mom isn't helping. The mom's response seems to be pushing responsibility onto the son, but he's not been given the necessary skills. At 17, some level of independence is expected, but if the parent hasn't provided the tools (like cooking skills) to achieve that, it's a problem. The mom's refusal to help or drive him to buy food when there's already a younger sibling who can cook might be seen as unfair. The author's frustration is understandable because they're left without food despite working hard. The key issue is whether the parent is responsible for teaching essential life skills, especially when the parent has taught those skills to another child. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't have the opportunity to learn, and the parent isn't supporting them when needed. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
