My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. The author is 17, can't cook much, and their mom didn't teach them. They came home expecting dinner after a long day and the mom expects them to figure it out. The mom's response seems dismissive, especially since the sister, who's 14, can cook. That's a bit contradictory.\n\nFirst, the author's age is 17. At that age, learning basic cooking skills is reasonable, but if the mom never taught them and didn't allow them to learn on their own, that's a problem. The mom's refusal to help, even to take the author to the store, adds to the issue because the author can't drive. The author being hungry and frustrated makes sense. The mom's response doesn't provide support, which could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. The sister being able to cook at 14 suggests the mom might have different standards for the older child. The author's anger stems from not being prepared for independence in cooking and the mom's lack of support. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the mom didn't provide the necessary skills or assistance. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
