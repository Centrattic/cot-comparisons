My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author can't cook, their mom never taught them, and when they came home expecting dinner, the mom told them to figure it out. The author is 17, can't drive, and the sister is 14 but the mom taught her to cook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly frustrated because they can't cook and their mom isn't helping. They worked late on prom and were hungry. The mom expects them to cook or use the existing ingredients, but the author isn't capable. The mom also mentions that their sister can cook, implying that the author should have been taught as well. The author is asking if they're the one at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is an adult in many places (17, approaching 18), so there's an expectation to be more independent. However, their mom never taught them to cook and also doesn't allow them to drive, which limits their ability to get food. The mom's response seems dismissive and unhelpful. The author's anger is a reaction to feeling unsupported and unprepared for a situation that their mom should have anticipated.\n\nBut the author could also be expected to take initiative. Maybe they should have brought up their inability to cook earlier or asked for help. However, the mom's response of \"you're 17, you can figure it out\" might be seen as not acknowledging the author's lack of skill. The author's frustration is valid because they're in a situation where they're expected to do something they weren't taught. The mom's comparison to the 14-year-old sister also doesn't make sense because the sister was actually taught, while the author wasn't.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. They didn't have the skills and the mom didn't provide the necessary support. The mom's responsibility includes teaching life skills, and since she didn't, the author's anger is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
