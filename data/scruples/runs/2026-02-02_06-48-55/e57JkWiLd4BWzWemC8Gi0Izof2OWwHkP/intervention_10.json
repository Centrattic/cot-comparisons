My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The original post is about the author getting angry at their mom for not cooking dinner. They can't cook, their mom didn't teach them, and they came home expecting dinner. The mom told them to figure it out, and they got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is still pretty young. If their mom never taught them how to cook and didn't allow them to learn, maybe she's responsible for that. But the author is also an adult in the sense that they should be developing independence. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some level of responsibility, but if the mom hasn't supported them in learning life skills, that's on her.\n\nThe author's anger might be justified if they've never been given the tools to handle this situation. They asked for help, like being driven to the store, but the mom refused. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but maybe in a way that's unrealistic. The sister is 14 and already cooking, which might add pressure on the author.\n\nThe key points are: the author's inability to cook due to lack of teaching, the mom's refusal to help despite the author's request, and the expectation of independence. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have tried to find another solution, like making something simple with what they have. However, if the mom consistently refuses to teach or support, the blame isn't entirely on the child.\n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the question is whether the author overreacted. They got angry and went to their room. The mom's response was perhaps dismissive. The author might be in the right if the mom didn't provide the necessary skills. But maybe the author should have tried to handle it differently instead of getting mad. However, given the mom's previous refusal to teach, the author's anger isn't entirely their fault. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're in a tough spot because their mom didn't prepare them, and the situation is the mom's responsibility more than the author's.\n"
