My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is 17 and can't cook anything beyond a few simple things. Their mom didn't teach them, and she doesn't trust them to cook or drive. They worked late at school and expected dinner, but the mom told them to figure it out. The author was frustrated because they can't cook and their sister, who is 14, was taught how to cook. The mom seems dismissive, saying they can figure it out despite the author's lack of skills. The argument escalates, and the author goes to their room hungry.\n\nFirst, the author's age is 17, which is approaching adulthood. But they're still a teenager, and their mom is their caregiver. The main issue here is the mom's responsibility to provide food, especially since the author isn't capable of cooking more than a few items. The mom was supposed to provide dinner but didn't. Instead, she expected the teen to figure it out even though she never taught them. The sister was taught, which adds to the frustration. The author's anger might stem from hunger and feeling unsupported, which is understandable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, getting angry because they can't cook and their mom didn't provide dinner could be seen as justified. The mom's response was dismissive, not helpful. However, the author didn't try to resolve the situation in a constructive way. Instead of getting mad, maybe they could have asked for help, but they did ask and the mom refused. The author's frustration is valid given their dependency and the mom's lack of support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is 17 and should be learning life skills, but the mom hasn't provided that. The mom's responsibility is to teach and support, not just expect the child to figure it out when it's their role to provide. The author's anger might be a result of being in a situation where their needs are being ignored. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The mom is the one who didn't provide the necessary support or alternatives. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
