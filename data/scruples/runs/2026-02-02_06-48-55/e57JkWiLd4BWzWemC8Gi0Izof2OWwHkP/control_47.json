My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The question is part of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) series, so they want a judgment on whether their actions were appropriate.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, which is still a minor in most places. They mention they can't cook anything beyond simple items like ramen, chicken nuggets, or mac and cheese. Their mom didn't teach them and doesn't trust them to teach themselves. They were at school until 7 PM, expecting dinner, but instead, their mom said they should cook themselves. The author points out they can't drive either, so they can't go to the store to buy pre-cooked items. The mom argues that the author's 14-year-old sister makes her own dinner, implying the author should do the same. The author got fed up and went to their room, now hungry. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider several factors. At 17, parents are typically still responsible for ensuring their child's basic needs are met, including meals. The fact that the mom didn't teach the author to cook and now is holding them accountable for it might be an issue. The author is in a situation where they're expected to cook but have never been taught, which could be seen as the mom's responsibility. However, the author's reaction was to get mad and go to their room, which is a childish response. The mom did give them resources (ingredients to cook with), but since the author can't cook, that might not be helpful. The sister is 14, which is also a minor, and if the mom taught her, maybe the author should too, but if the author was never taught, that's a problem. Also, the mom isn't buying them food even though they can't drive, which complicates things since the author can't go to the store themselves.\n\nThe key points are: the author's inability to cook due to lack of instruction from the parent, the parent's expectation that the author can figure it out, and the author's reaction. On one hand, the parent might be trying to teach independence, but if they didn't provide the necessary skills, that's a different story. On the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable, but their response was to storm off, which isn't constructive. However, in the AITA context, the community often considers the validity of the person's reasoning. Here, the author is pointing out a lack of preparation and support from their mom, which is legitimate. The anger in this case might be justified if the mom is now expecting them to cook without ever teaching them. The sister being 14 and able to cook could be a red flag, as maybe the mom is treating the older child as responsible without proper guidance. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but their reaction might have been immature. However, the underlying issue is the mom's responsibility. So I would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but maybe with a note that the mom's approach is flawed. But according to the AITA format, the answer is either A or B. Since the author can't cook and the parent didn't teach them, the parent is at fault, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
