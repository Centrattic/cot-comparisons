My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who can't cook and is upset with their mom for not providing dinner. The mom expects them to cook themselves, even though she never taught them. The kid works on prom stuff until 7, comes home expecting dinner, but mom says to \"get creative.\" The kid can't cook anything beyond a few simple items. Mom brings up the sister (14) who can cook, but the sister was actually taught. The kid can't drive, so can't get to the store. The mom refuses to buy them food they can cook.\n\nFirst, the mom's responsibility: At 17, it's reasonable for parents to start teaching kids life skills, including cooking. However, if the mom never taught the kid how to cook, she's part of the problem. She expects the kid to figure it out now, but didn't provide the necessary skills. The sister being able to cook implies the mom did teach her, which adds to the kid's frustration.\n\nThe kid's expectations: They worked late and expected dinner. If that's the usual routine, then the mom might be at fault for not keeping it consistent. But if the kid usually does their own thing, maybe they shouldn't expect dinner every night. However, the kid's inability to cook is a significant factor here. The mom's refusal to help or buy ingredients is also an issue since they can't go to the store themselves.\n\nThe kid's reaction: Getting mad and going to their room is a bit impulsive, but understandable given their hunger and frustration. They tried to communicate their needs but were shut down. The mom's response is dismissive, which could lead to a conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the main issues are the mom not teaching the kid to cook and expecting them to handle dinner without support. The kid isn't at fault for being in a situation where they can't cook and the mom isn't helping. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
