My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset because their mom didn't cook dinner for them. The author can't cook and hasn't been taught, so they expected their mom to have dinner ready. Their mom told them to figure it out, and the author got mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 17, which is a teenager. Depending on cultural norms, some parents might expect their 17-year-old to start learning basic cooking skills. However, the author's mom hasn't taught them, and they haven't been allowed to drive or cook on their own. The mom might feel that the teenager should be able to manage now, but the author is frustrated because they can't.\n\nThe mom's response was to tell them to use what's available and that their 14-year-old sister can cook. The author might feel that the mom isn't being supportive, especially since they can't drive and the sister was taught. The author's anger comes from feeling unprepared and unsupported.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might see this as the teenager needing to become more independent. At 17, there's an expectation to take more responsibility. However, the author's inability to cook isn't their fault\u2014they were never taught by their mom. The mom's refusal to help buy food or drive them might be seen as not providing necessary support.\n\nI think the key points here are: Was the mom negligent in not teaching the teenager to cook? Is the teenager's anger justified given that they were never taught? The author's frustration is about the lack of preparation and support. The mom's stance is about independence, but if she never taught them, then maybe she's not being fair. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom might share some blame for not teaching the teenager. The teenager's anger is understandable because they were not given the tools to handle the situation. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, maybe the author could have taken initiative earlier or communicated better. But since the mom didn't teach them and is now expecting them to handle it, the author's reaction is valid. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). They were not taught essential skills by their parent, and the parent is now expecting them to manage without support. The author's anger is a result of the parent's lack of preparation.\n"
