My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at their mom for not cooking dinner. The situation is that the author is 17, can't cook much, and after a long day at school expected dinner but didn't get it. The mom said to figure it out, but the author feels they weren't taught how to cook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a teenager who hasn't been taught essential life skills like cooking. The mom might be trying to encourage independence, but maybe she didn't realize the extent of the problem. The author's frustration is valid because they're not equipped to handle cooking on their own. However, reacting by getting angry and retreating to their room could be seen as a bit immature, especially since they have a younger sister who can cook. But wait, the mom did mention that the sister was taught, so maybe the author should have learned earlier. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might not have recognized the importance of teaching the author how to cook, assuming they could pick it up later. But at 17, expecting someone to just figure it out without any guidance might be unrealistic. The author's request to go to the store was denied, which added to the frustration. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of prior teaching and the expectation of self-sufficiency. The author isn't wrong for feeling wronged, as the mom didn't provide the necessary skills. The anger stems from a place of needing help that wasn't available. However, the author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by trying to learn earlier or communicating better. But the core issue is the mom's failure to teach, so the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom should have anticipated that the son needed cooking skills. The author's anger is a reaction to being unprepared for this responsibility. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the mother is more at fault for not teaching, and the author's frustration is justified given the circumstances.\n"
