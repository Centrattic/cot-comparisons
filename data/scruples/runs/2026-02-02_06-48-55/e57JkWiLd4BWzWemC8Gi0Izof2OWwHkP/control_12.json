My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 17 and can't cook anything except a few simple things like ramen, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese. They came home from school working on prom decorations until 7 PM expecting dinner. Their mom didn't have dinner ready and told them to cook something themselves. The author says their mom never taught them how to cook and didn't trust them to learn on their own. They tried to ask for help or a ride to buy something they can cook, but the mom refused. The author got upset and went to their room, and now they're really hungry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a teenager who's never been taught how to cook. Their mom hasn't taught them and doesn't trust them with the stove. At 17, it's reasonable to expect some independence, but maybe not if they haven't had the opportunity to learn. The mom might think the child should be more self-reliant, but if they haven't been taught, is it fair to expect them to just figure it out?\n\nThe mom's response seems dismissive. She mentions that the author's 14-year-old sister can make her own dinner. But the author points out that the mom actually taught the sister how to cook. So there's a discrepancy here. The author is in a situation where they have the least access to resources because they haven't been taught, and the mom isn't offering help. The author is trying to find a solution, like going to the store for something they can cook, but the mom refuses. The author is left hungry and frustrated.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're not being unreasonable. They expected dinner because that's what they've been used to. When that doesn't happen, they're in a tough spot because they lack the skills. The mom's response seems to not take into account the lack of teaching. The author's anger comes from feeling unprepared and unsupported. \n\nHowever, the mom might argue that at 17, the author should be learning to cook and take responsibility. But if the mom hasn't provided any instruction or support, expecting them to suddenly figure it out isn't fair. The author is essentially stuck in a situation where they're being asked to do something they haven't been given the tools for. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of prior teaching and the mom's refusal to provide assistance or alternatives. The author isn't being unreasonable in their frustration. The mom's actions could be seen as contributing to the problem. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
