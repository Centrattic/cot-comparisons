My mom never taught me and she never trusted me to teach myself. I'm 17 goddamn years old and i can't cook anything other than ramen noodles, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese on a good day. Can't make a grilled cheese or Hamburger Helper or any of that fancy shit.\n\nI was at school working on prom decorations until 7:00 and got home expecting to see dinner on the table. Instead, my mom and I had this lovely conversation:\n\nMe: Hey, what's for supper?\nMom: Whatever you can find.\nMe: So, nothing?\nMom: There's plenty of stuff for you to cook with, get creative.\nMe: I can't cook, you never taught me how.\nMom: You're 17, you can figure it out.\nMe: No, I can't. I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThe author is 17 and can't cook anything beyond a few simple things like ramen, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese. They got home from school working on prom decorations until 7 PM, expecting dinner to be ready. Their mom said to find something to cook, but the author can't. The mom mentioned that the author's 14-year-old sister can cook, but the author wasn't taught. The mom also refused to drive them to the store, even though the author can't drive either. The argument escalated, and the author went to their room hungry.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age. At 17, one might expect some level of independence, but cooking isn't something everyone learns automatically. The author explicitly states they were never taught by their mom and that the mom doesn't trust them to teach themselves. The sister is 14 and knows how to cook, which the mom taught her. That's interesting because the sister is younger but has the skill, implying the mom did teach at least one child. \n\nThe author's request to be driven to the store to buy something they can cook is reasonable, but the mom refused, saying they already have food. However, the author can't use the food because they don't know how to cook it. This seems like a catch-22. The mom is expecting the author to cook without prior instruction, and there's no support system in place.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They worked late, expected dinner, and are left without options. The mom's response seems dismissive. It's possible the mom is trying to encourage independence, but without providing the necessary skills or resources. \n\nHowever, from the mom's perspective, she might be trying to teach the author to be self-sufficient, perhaps thinking that they should start learning now. But the author didn't have the opportunity to learn, and the sister was taught, which might indicate a double standard. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They expressed frustration and went to their room, which is a reaction to feeling unsupported. The mom's refusal to help might be contributing to the problem. The author's inability to cook isn't their fault, given they weren't taught. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue lies in the mom not providing the necessary skills or support when the author was younger. The author is reacting to a lack of preparation. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
