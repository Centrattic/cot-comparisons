Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're an asshole for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. They mention checking out her guy friends to see their intentions, not being threatening but just taking notes. The girlfriend got upset, called them sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed some time alone. Now they're questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are trust and boundaries. Trust is fundamental in a relationship. If someone is constantly checking up on their partner's friends, especially in a way that invades privacy, it can be seen as controlling. The author's actions might not involve direct threats, but the act of vetting others' intentions without their knowledge can erode trust. \n\nThe girlfriend felt that her friends were being judged, which could make her feel like she's being monitored. Even if the author's intention is to protect, the method might be overstepping. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to take time alone shows that the author's actions had a negative impact on the relationship. \n\nControl in a relationship often involves wanting to manage or restrict a partner's interactions, which is what the author is doing. Even if it's not overtly controlling, the underlying motivation to control the social environment around the partner can be problematic. \n\nThe author might believe they're being cautious, but in relationships, trust should be mutual. If there's a lack of trust without valid reasons, it can lead to issues. The girlfriend's reactions are valid because she might feel that her autonomy is being compromised. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are likely crossing into controlling behavior, which justifies the girlfriend's response. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
