Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author, let's call him, is in an 8-month relationship with Jenna. He mentions he doesn't trust her male friends, checking them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. He's not threatening but taking notes. One guy seemed interested in her, and he's concerned. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. Now they're back together but he's questioning if he did wrong.\n\nI think the key points here are about trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author is doing something that many people would see as overstepping. Trust is usually a fundamental part of a healthy relationship. If he doesn't trust her friends, maybe there's an issue there. But why doesn't he trust them? The post says he assumes they \"probably want her,\" so maybe his own insecurities are playing a role here.\n\nVetting someone else's friends without their knowledge or consent could be seen as controlling. Jenna had \"pieced together\" that he's been checking on them, which might mean she found out in a way that felt invasive. She called him sexist, which might imply that he's making assumptions about male friends based on gender. Controlling behavior is when one partner tries to manage the other's social interactions, which can be a red flag.\n\nThe author thinks he's being cautious, but the line between being cautious and being controlling is thin. If Jenna felt his actions were inappropriate, then he might be overstepping. The fact that she needed space shows the impact of his actions on their relationship.\n\nSo, even if his intentions are to protect, the method of doing it without her knowledge is problematic. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual trust. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, he should talk to Jenna about his concerns. His actions might have stemmed from insecurity, but acting on them in a covert way is what's causing the issue here. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
