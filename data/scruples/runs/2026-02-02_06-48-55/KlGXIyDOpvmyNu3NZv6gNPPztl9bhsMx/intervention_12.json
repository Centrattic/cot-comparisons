Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions checking out her guy friends to ensure they aren't hitting on her or leading her astray. His GF called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and if one partner is constantly checking the other's friends, that could indicate a lack of trust. The author isn't just being cautious; he's actively investigating, which can be seen as intrusive. The girlfriend felt the need to take time alone, which suggests his actions hurt her feelings and made her feel controlled.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't trust these friends. But in a healthy relationship, unless there's concrete evidence of wrongdoing, suspicion without cause can be controlling. The fact that the girlfriend noticed the pattern and felt wronged points to the behavior being intrusive. The author's actions might stem from insecurity, but that's not a justification for controlling behavior.\n\nAlso, the mention of the girlfriend's friends having the \"same story\" about him might imply that the author's actions have been noticed and possibly made the friends uncomfortable, which could strain the girlfriend's relationships outside the couple. Jealousy is natural, but acting on it by vetting friends without open communication is problematic.\n\nThe key points are consent, communication, and respect for each other's autonomy. The author didn't discuss his concerns with his GF first, leading to her feeling disrespected. The answer is likely A, as the behavior is controlling and lacks trust, which is essential in a relationship.\n"
