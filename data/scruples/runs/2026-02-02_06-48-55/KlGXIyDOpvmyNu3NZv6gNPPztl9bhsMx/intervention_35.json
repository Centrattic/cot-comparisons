Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The question is whether his actions are justified or if he's being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that he doesn't trust the guy friends and checks them out to make sure they aren't interested in his girlfriend romantically. He's not threatening but just observing. However, the girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The girlfriend's friends are part of her life, and the author's actions might be seen as an invasion of her privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the act of vetting without her knowledge could be considered controlling. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust. The girlfriend has the right to her own social circle without her partner interfering. \n\nAlso, the author's actions might not be based on actual evidence but on his own suspicions. Assuming the worst about her friends could lead to unnecessary conflict. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she feels her autonomy is being challenged, which can be a valid concern. \n\nSo, while the author might think he's being cautious, his actions likely overstep appropriate boundaries. The answer would lean towards him being in the wrong.\n"
