Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him John, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause problems. He's not threatening, just taking notes. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed some time alone. Now they're back, but he's wondering if he was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If John doesn't trust Jenna's friends, that might indicate underlying issues in their relationship. Checking up on her friends could be seen as a form of surveillance or control. Even if he's not doing anything overtly threatening, the act of vetting without her knowledge could be a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's consent. If Jenna isn't aware he's doing this, it's a problem. Open communication is key. If he had discussed his concerns with her and they came to an agreement, maybe it's different. But since she found out and was upset, it suggests he didn't get her consent. That's a red flag.\n\nJealousy and control are tricky. It's normal to feel some jealousy, but acting on it without discussion can lead to problems. The fact that Jenna called him controlling and paranoid is a sign that his actions made her feel uncomfortable. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust. His behavior might be making Jenna feel like he doesn't trust her judgment or her ability to handle her own friendships.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's been doing this for 8 months without her knowing is significant. That's a long time to build up resentment. The fact that she needed alone time shows the impact of his actions. Even if he's not doing anything illegal, it's about the emotional impact on the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because his actions, while stemming from insecurity, are controlling and lack transparency, which can harm the trust and autonomy in the relationship.\n"
