Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is checking out their girlfriend's male friends to see what their intentions are. They admit they don't trust these guys and want to make sure they're not going to hit on her or anything. The girlfriend got mad, saying he's sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship. If the author doesn't trust his girlfriend's male friends, that could indicate underlying issues, like jealousy or insecurity. However, the way he's handling it\u2014vetting them\u2014might be problematic. \n\nVetting someone without discussing it with the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are good, doing this behind her back might make her feel like he doesn't trust her judgment or her ability to choose her friends. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected and possibly controlled. The term \"controlling\" is strong, but if he's making decisions about her friendships without her input, that could be controlling.\n\nHe mentions that he's not threatening, just taking notes. But the act of monitoring her friends, even if it's just mentally assessing them, can come off as invasive. It's important to consider boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy. If he's making assumptions about her friends' intentions, that might be projecting his own insecurities onto her friends.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If the author had concerns, he should have talked to his girlfriend about them instead of vetting her friends secretly. Open communication is key. By not discussing his feelings and instead taking matters into his own hands, he might have caused unnecessary tension. The girlfriend needed time alone, which is a sign that his actions hurt her.\n\nThe argument that he's just trying to protect her might not hold up if it's causing her distress. There's a difference between being cautious and being controlling. Healthy relationships don't require one partner to monitor the other's social life. Trusting each other's judgment is part of mutual respect.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends might feel targeted or judged if they knew. Even if she's aware, the fact that she pieced together that her friends had a \"story\" about the author suggests there's some kind of surveillance or judgment happening, which isn't healthy.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have good intentions, his actions of vetting her male friends without discussing it with her are likely controlling and distrustful. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled and disrespected are valid. The right approach would have been to communicate his concerns rather than act unilaterally. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
