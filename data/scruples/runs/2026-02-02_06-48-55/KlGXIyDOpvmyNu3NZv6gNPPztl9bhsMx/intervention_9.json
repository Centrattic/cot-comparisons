Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author vetting their girlfriend's male friends, which has caused conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and his girlfriend have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. He's not threatening, just observing. One guy seemed interested in her, so he doesn't trust him. His GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. Now, they're back together, but he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide if A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet's break down the factors. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships. The author is expressing distrust without evidence. He's assuming the worst about her friends, which can be controlling. Checking her friends without her knowledge breaches trust. Even if his intentions are protective, the action is invasive. His GF's reaction is valid because being monitored can feel controlling. Also, 8 months is a time when trust should be established unless there are red flags. The author isn't giving her friends the benefit of the doubt and is acting on suspicion, which can create a toxic environment. However, maybe he's just trying to protect the relationship. But the method is problematic. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong because his actions are controlling and erode trust. The answer is A.\n"
