Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. So, first, I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is checking out his girlfriend's male friends to see their intentions, worried they might hit on her or lead her to cheat. He mentions he's not threatening but just taking note. The girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. \n\nHmm, trust issues are common in relationships, but the key here is how he's handling them. By \"vetting,\" does he mean stalking them, interrogating his girlfriend, or just observing? The post says he's taking note of them, maybe checking their social media or something. But even so, without the girlfriend's knowledge or consent, this could be seen as invasive.\n\nJealousy can be a red flag if it's based on insecurity rather than evidence. The author is assuming these friends have ulterior motives without proof. The girlfriend's friends being \"good guys\" is subjective. The author's actions might be perceived as controlling because he's not trusting her judgment in choosing friends. Healthy relationships involve trust; constant vetting can erode that trust and make the other person feel micromanaged.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014needing time alone\u2014indicates that his actions hurt her. She might feel disrespected, as if he doesn't trust her. Even if his intentions are to protect, the method is problematic. The AITA community often emphasizes communication, so maybe the author should have discussed his concerns with her instead of acting unilaterally.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions are controlling and based on distrust without evidence. The answer should be A.\n"
