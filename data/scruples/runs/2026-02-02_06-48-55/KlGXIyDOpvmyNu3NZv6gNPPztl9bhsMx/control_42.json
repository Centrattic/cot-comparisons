Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author says they don't trust the guy friends, check them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. The GF got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The question is if the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are:\n\n1. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge, checking their intentions.\n2. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling it's controlling and sexist.\n3. The author's reasoning is mistrust and wanting to prevent cheating.\n\nNow, in relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is secretly vetting the other's friends, that's a breach of trust. The author is acting out of suspicion without discussing his concerns openly with his GF. Control and jealousy can be issues here. The GF's reaction is valid because she might feel her autonomy is being invaded. The fact that he's doing this without her knowledge or consent is problematic. Even if some guys might be interested in her, he's assuming the worst without proof. It's possible he's projecting his own insecurities onto her friends. Healthy relationships require communication, not surveillance. The GF's terms about lady friends versus guy friends indicate she sees a difference, maybe because of past issues or expectations of boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as controlling because he's limiting who she can associate with based on his own distrust. The fact that he's not threatening but just \"taking note\" doesn't make it right if it's done without transparency. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because his actions are controlling and invasive, undermining trust and her autonomy.\n"
