Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the author has been checking out her guy friends to ensure they don't have romantic intentions towards his girlfriend, Jenna. The main issue here is whether this behavior is controlling or overstepping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author is in a committed relationship and has trust issues with Jenna's male friends. While it's natural to feel protective, the way he's handling it could be problematic. The key factors here are consent and communication. The author didn't discuss this with Jenna; instead, he took it upon himself to vet her friends. This lack of communication can lead to feelings of being controlled or disrespected.\n\nJenna reacted strongly, calling him sexist and controlling. Those are serious accusations. Even if the author's intentions are good, the method of secretly vetting her friends without her knowledge or consent can be seen as a breach of trust. It's important to note that trust is a two-way street in a relationship. If the author is feeling insecure, he should address those feelings with open communication rather than surveillance.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that all male friends have ulterior motives. This could stem from the author's own insecurities or stereotypes, which can contribute to controlling behavior. Trusting someone is a fundamental part of a healthy relationship. By not trusting Jenna's judgment in choosing her friends, the author might be undermining her autonomy.\n\nThe author mentions that he's not threatening but just taking notes. However, the act of vetting itself, even if passive, can be intrusive. It's about respecting the other person's social life and privacy. If Jenna felt the need to take time alone, it's a sign that his actions hurt her and made her feel uncomfortable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect the relationship, the method he used is problematic. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and respect for each other's privacy and autonomy. The author's actions crossed into controlling behavior, which is why Jenna felt justified in her reaction. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
