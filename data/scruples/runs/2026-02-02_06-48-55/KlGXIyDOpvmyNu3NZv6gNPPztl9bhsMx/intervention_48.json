Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him Alex for clarity, mentions that they've been together for 8 months and that he doesn't trust the guy friends. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or get her to cheat. His girlfriend, Jenna, got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed time alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship. If someone is constantly vetting their partner's friends without discussing it, that can come across as controlling. Even if the intent is to protect, the method here is invasive. The author is taking notes on the guy friends, which sounds like surveillance, not open communication. That can erode trust instead of building it.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The author didn't ask Jenna about this before doing it. She found out later, which probably made her feel disrespected. In a relationship, both partners should be on the same page about boundaries. If the author had concerns, he should have talked to Jenna about them instead of taking unilateral action.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about not trusting the guys because they might be interested in Jenna. That's a common insecurity, but acting on it without evidence can be problematic. It's one thing to have feelings of jealousy, but another to actively monitor and investigate others without the partner's knowledge. It's possible that some of the guys are just friends, and the author's actions might be based on unfounded assumptions.\n\nJenna's reaction is valid. Feeling that her partner is being sexist or controlling is a legitimate concern. If the author is making judgments about her friends based on his own perceptions, that can be seen as dismissive of her judgment and her autonomy. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect, and this action might be crossing a line.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that it's natural to have concerns about a partner's interactions with others. However, the key issue here is how those concerns are addressed. Open communication and trust are more constructive approaches than covert vetting. The fact that Jenna needed time alone after the argument shows the impact of his actions on her feelings.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have had intentions of protecting the relationship, his methods of vetting without discussion are likely seen as controlling and invasive. The right approach would have been to address his insecurities directly with Jenna, fostering trust rather than undermining it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
