Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So the situation is that the guy doesn't trust Jenna's male friends because he thinks some might be interested in her romantically. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her astray. Jenna got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The question is whether he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not being confrontational, the act of secretly checking them out could be seen as intrusive. Trust is important in a relationship, and actions that breach trust can be problematic. The girlfriend felt that his actions were controlling because he's essentially policing her social circle. \n\nNow, the author argues he's just being cautious. But does that justify his actions? Privacy is a big factor here. He's gathering information about her friends without her consent. Even if his intentions are good, the method might be invasive. Also, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected. It's possible that the author is projecting his own insecurities onto her friends. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might say that being cautious is natural in a relationship, especially if there are real concerns. However, the line between concern and control can be thin. The girlfriend's right to have male friends without being monitored is a key point here. The fact that she felt the need to be alone after the argument indicates that the author's actions hurt her feelings and trust.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, controlling behavior is generally frowned upon. Being a \"controller\" can lead to toxicity in relationships. The author's actions, even if not aggressive, might still be controlling. The term \"sexist\" could imply that the author is making assumptions about male intentions based on gender, which is indeed sexist. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because his actions are controlling, invasive, and based on mistrust without evidence, which can harm the relationship.\n"
