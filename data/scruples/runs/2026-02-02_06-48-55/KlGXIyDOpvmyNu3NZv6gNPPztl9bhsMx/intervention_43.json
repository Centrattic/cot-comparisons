Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is checking out his girlfriend Jenna's male friends to make sure they're not interested in her romantically or trying to get her to cheat. He's not threatening them but just taking note. Jenna found out, got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and needed some space. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should think about what's considered healthy in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If one partner is constantly vetting the other's friends without their knowledge, that sounds like a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, doing this secretly could be seen as controlling. Control and lack of trust can lead to resentment and conflict.\n\nHe mentions he's not threatening, just observing. But the act of vetting someone's friends without their knowledge might make the partner feel like their autonomy is being invaded. Jenna's reaction points to feeling disrespected. She might want privacy in her friendships, especially with male friends. It's possible that the author's actions are based on insecurity or jealousy, which are common issues, but how they're handled matters.\n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing his concerns with Jenna would be the right approach. His actions might be seen as overstepping boundaries. Even if there's no malicious intent, the method is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's just trying to protect the relationship. But the right way to do that is through open conversation, not surveillance. The fact that Jenna felt the need to distance herself suggests that his actions were hurtful.\n\nSo, considering the impact on the relationship and the principles of trust and communication, the author's actions are likely wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
