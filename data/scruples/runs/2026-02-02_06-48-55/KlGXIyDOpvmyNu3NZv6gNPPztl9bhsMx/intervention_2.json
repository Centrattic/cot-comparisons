Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is vetting their girlfriend's male friends by checking out their intentions. They mention they don't trust these guys and want to ensure they aren't hitting on her or causing issues. The girlfriend, Jenna, found out and called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid, leading to her needing space. Now the author is questioning if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust in a relationship is crucial. The author is acting out of insecurity or fear, but the method they're using\u2014vetting friends without the girlfriend's knowledge\u2014could be seen as invasive. Even if their intentions are to protect the relationship, the act of secretly checking on Jenna's friends might cross into controlling behavior. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important. She felt targeted and accused the author of being sexist and controlling, which suggests she feels her autonomy is being violated. The fact that she needed time alone indicates the argument was significant. The author's justification is mistrust in the guys, but the way they handled it\u2014without communicating their concerns to Jenna\u2014might have been the real issue. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting friends, the author should have discussed their insecurities with Jenna. The act of vetting without consent can erode trust and make the girlfriend feel that her friendships are under scrutiny. It's possible the author's actions are a form of controlling behavior, even if they don't intend to be. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions might stem from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, the method used is problematic. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because their actions were controlling and lacked transparency, which is a breach of trust in the relationship.\n"
