Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author, let's call him John, explains that he doesn't trust Jenna's guy friends because he thinks some might have romantic intentions. He mentions he checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and left for a couple of days. Now, they're back together, but the argument lingers.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: John is checking out Jenna's male friends without her knowledge, which she found out and was upset about. He justifies it as wanting to ensure their intentions are good. But does that make him wrong?\n\nTrust is a big part of relationships. If John is acting out of jealousy, that's a red flag. Jealousy can be a natural emotion, but acting on it without communication is problematic. He's essentially doing surveillance or stalking her friends, which is a form of control. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is invasive. \n\nJenna's reaction is valid. She might feel that if she can't trust John with her friendships, especially with male friends, then there's a bigger issue in the relationship. Labeling him as controlling or paranoid suggests she feels he's overstepping boundaries. The fact that she needed time alone indicates the breach of trust was significant.\n\nIs there a line between normal jealousy and controlling behavior? Vetting friends by checking up on them without their knowledge is crossing a line. Healthy relationships require trust. If John can't trust Jenna and her friends, that's a problem he should address with her through communication, not by secretly vetting them. \n\nAlso, the term \"sexist\" implies that John's actions are based on stereotypes about men's intentions, which could be a valid accusation. If he assumes all men are potential threats, that's a sexist viewpoint. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have autonomy over their friendships. Interfering in that, especially without discussion, is a no-go. John didn't talk to Jenna about his insecurities but instead took matters into his own hands, which is controlling. \n\nSo, putting it all together: John's actions are controlling, invasive, and lack trust. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A."
