Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for \"vetting\" their girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions checking out these friends to ensure they don't hit on her or harm the relationship. The girlfriend felt it was sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, consent comes to mind. The author isn't asking Jenna for permission to investigate her friends. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If the author is constantly checking up on her friends without discussing it, that could be controlling behavior. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt her autonomy was invaded. \n\nThen there's the aspect of how the vetting happens. If the author is using invasive methods like checking social media, looking into their backgrounds, or something more covert, that's a problem. Even if he's just observing, it's still about how he's doing it without her knowledge. \n\nAnother angle is the reasoning. The author says he doesn't trust the guys, but trust is usually a two-way street. If he doesn't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that's a bigger issue. The girlfriend might feel he's not respecting her ability to handle her own relationships and interactions.\n\nThe term \"controlling\" is important here. Controlling behavior often involves trying to monitor or restrict a partner's actions without their consent. Even if the author's intentions are to protect, the method of doing it without transparency could be harmful. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned the guys have the same story about the author, which might indicate that the vetting is noticeable and making the friends uncomfortable. That could create tension and mistrust from the other side as well.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. The author didn't talk to Jenna about his concerns before taking action. Instead of addressing his own insecurities directly, he took it upon himself to investigate, which is a classic sign of control issues. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions, while stemming from insecurity, are invasive and lack consent, leading to the girlfriend feeling controlled and disrespected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
