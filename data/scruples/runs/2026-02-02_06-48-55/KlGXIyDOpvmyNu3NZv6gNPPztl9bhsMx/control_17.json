Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, Jenna, have been together for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, thinking at least one of them is interested in her romantically. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not threatening, just taking notes. But Jenna found out, got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed some time alone. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is his actions of vetting her friends. I need to consider trust in relationships. In healthy relationships, mutual trust is crucial. If one partner is constantly checking up on the other's friends, especially the opposite sex, that can be seen as controlling or distrustful, regardless of the intentions.\n\nHe mentions he's not doing anything threatening, just observing. However, the fact that he's assessing her friends without her knowledge or consent could be problematic. Trust and respect are key. By doing this, he's implying that he doesn't trust her judgment or her ability to handle her own friendships, which might come off as controlling.\n\nAlso, Jenna's reaction is valid. She feels that his actions are sexist, which might stem from the idea that he's assuming all male friends have ulterior motives. That could be a form of sexism, stereotyping men as potential threats. His actions also invade her privacy, as she didn't agree to him vetting her friends. The fact that she needed time alone indicates that his actions hurt her and made her feel disrespected.\n\nEven if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method he's using is inappropriate. Communication is important. Instead of secretly vetting friends, he should talk to Jenna about his insecurities. Open communication would be healthier and build trust, rather than undermining it.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author's actions are likely making him the asshole here. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions breach trust, invade privacy, and are controlling, even if his motives are to protect the relationship.\n"
