Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that they don't trust these friends and are checking them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The user wants to know if he's an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The user is checking out his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. That's a big red flag. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and if he's not trusting her friends, that could erode the trust between him and his girlfriend. Also, the fact that he's snooping or investigating might be seen as a violation of privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important here. She called him controlling and sexist. Controlling behavior can manifest in many ways, including monitoring a partner's friends without their consent. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. It's about mutual trust and respect. If he can't trust her judgment in choosing her friends, that could lead to deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that all male friends might have romantic intentions. That's a generalization and could be sexist, as it presumes that all men are potential threats. This kind of thinking can put unnecessary strain on the relationship and may not be fair to the friends in question.\n\nThe user mentions that he's not threatening but just taking note. However, the act of vetting without communication is where the problem lies. Healthy relationships require open communication about insecurities rather than covert actions. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them with his girlfriend instead of making unilateral decisions.\n\nThe girlfriend needing space after the argument suggests that his actions caused significant distress. Even though they're back to being calm, the underlying issue remains. The key here is whether the trust and respect in the relationship were upheld. By vetting her friends without her knowledge, the user breached that trust. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intentions might be to protect the relationship, his methods are controlling and invasive. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions violate trust and privacy, and his approach is not respectful of his girlfriend's autonomy and her relationships with others.\n"
