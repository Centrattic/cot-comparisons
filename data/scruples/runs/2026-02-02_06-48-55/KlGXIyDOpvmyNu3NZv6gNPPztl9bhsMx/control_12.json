Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's been checking out his girlfriend's male friends to make sure they're not trying to hit on her or something. He's not threatening them, just vetting them. The girlfriend got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and took some time alone. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If he doesn't trust her male friends, that might be a red flag. But why doesn't he trust them? Maybe he's just being cautious. But does he have a valid reason? The problem is, he's secretly checking them out. That's where it gets iffy. If he's not being open about his concerns, that could be controlling behavior. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's taking notes on them and monitoring their interactions might be invasive. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, doing it behind her back without discussing it could be seen as a breach of trust. Communication is key. He should have talked to her about his feelings instead of doing it on his own. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She felt it was sexist and controlling. That might mean he's violating her trust by not discussing it with her. It's possible he's projecting his insecurities onto her friends. Maybe he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that he's just being proactive. But generally, in healthy relationships, you don't \"vet\" your partner's friends without their knowledge. That can create a power imbalance and make the partner feel like they're not trusted. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's acting on his distrust without addressing it with his partner, leading to her feeling controlled and disrespected. The answer should be A.\n"
