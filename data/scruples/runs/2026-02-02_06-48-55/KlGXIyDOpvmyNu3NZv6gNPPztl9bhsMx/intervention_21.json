Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he doesn't trust her guy friends and checks them out to make sure they're not hitting on her or causing issues. His GF got mad, called him sexist and controlling.\n\nHmm. So first, the key points here are trust in a relationship and boundaries. The author feels the need to vet her friends because he's not trusting them. But the girlfriend is upset because she feels he's being controlling and sexist. \n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If you don't trust your partner's friends, that can be a problem. But the line between being cautious and being controlling is thin. The author mentions he's not threatening, just taking notes. But the fact that he's monitoring her friends without her knowledge could be an invasion of her privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect, it's about how it's perceived and the impact on the relationship.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. Being called sexist and controlling suggests that she feels her autonomy is being questioned. She might feel that her male friends are being judged based on stereotypes or that her judgment about her friends isn't trusted. \n\nThe author's justification is that he wants to ensure her safety and prevent any issues, but it's important to consider whether this behavior is actually respectful. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust. If he's not allowing her to form friendships without his oversight, that's a red flag. \n\nThe fact that she needed a day or two alone after the argument shows the emotional impact. Even if things are calm now, the underlying issue might still exist. The author might need to address his trust issues in a way that doesn't control her, like communicating openly instead of secretly vetting her friends.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect, the method he's using invades her privacy and undermines trust. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
