Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is about a guy named Jenna who's been with his girlfriend for 8 months. He doesn't trust her guy friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause her to cheat. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, leading to a temporary separation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's actions are about \"vetting\" the male friends, which implies he's monitoring or investigating them without their knowledge. The problem arises because the girlfriend found out and felt that his behavior was invasive. \n\nTrusting issues in a relationship can be a valid concern, but the approach taken matters. If the author is secretly checking up on her friends, that crosses into controlling behavior. Healthy relationships require trust and open communication. Instead of secretly vetting, he should discuss his concerns with her directly. \n\nAlso, the assumption that her male friends are inherently a threat might be based on stereotypes or his own insecurities, which could be considered sexist. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that her boundaries were crossed. \n\nEven if the intention is to protect, the method isn't respectful. The girlfriend has the right to her own friendships, and assuming the worst about her male friends can be damaging. The fact that their argument led to her wanting space indicates that his actions were not acceptable. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. His actions are controlling and lack trust, which are important in a relationship.\n"
