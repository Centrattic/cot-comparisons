Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is checking out their girlfriend's male friends to ensure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause issues. They mention they're not threatening but just taking notes. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether his actions are justified or overstepping. Trust is a big part of a healthy relationship. Checking up on her friends without her knowledge might be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect, the method could be controlling. \n\nControl in relationships can be a sensitive topic. If he's monitoring her interactions without her consent, that's usually not acceptable. People generally expect privacy and autonomy in their friendships. The girlfriend's reaction points to feeling that her space is invaded. \n\nHe mentions he's okay with her female friends but not male ones. That could indicate a double standard, which might contribute to the \"sexist\" label she gave him. Trusting her friends without judgment is important. Assuming the worst about her male friends might not be fair unless there's concrete evidence of issues.\n\nThe argument led to her needing space, which suggests the action hurt her feelings. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing his concerns openly might have been a better approach. \n\nSo putting it all together: The actions seem controlling and lack trust. The girlfriend's response is valid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
