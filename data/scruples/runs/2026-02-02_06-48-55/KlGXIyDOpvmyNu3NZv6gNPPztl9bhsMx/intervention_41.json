Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The key points from the story are that the person doesn't trust the guy friends, checks them out to see their intentions, and their girlfriend got upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered normal in relationships. Trust is a big part of any healthy relationship. If someone is constantly checking up on their partner's friends without their knowledge, that could be seen as controlling. The author mentions they're not threatening but just \"taking note,\" which might mean they're monitoring or maybe even stalking the friends. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important too. She felt that his actions were invasive. Even if the author's intention is to protect, the method might not be appropriate. Trust issues can stem from insecurity, but acting on those insecurities by vetting others without the partner's consent can damage the relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that there's \"at least one guy who probably wants her\" could be a projection or assumption. Everyone has friends of the opposite sex, and not all interactions are suspicious. The line between being cautious and being controlling is thin here. \n\nThe girlfriend needing time alone shows that the action hurt her feelings. Healthy relationships require open communication about concerns instead of covert actions. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing the trust issues with her might have been a better approach. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions likely crossed into controlling behavior, even if the motivation was from a place of wanting to protect. The fact that the girlfriend felt those actions were sexist and controlling indicates that the author is in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
