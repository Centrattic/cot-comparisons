Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, Jenna, for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, thinking some of them might be interested in her romantically. He mentions he checks out these guys to see what they're like and their intentions, to prevent them from hitting on her or causing issues. He's not threatening but just taking note. However, Jenna found out and got angry, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not being overtly controlling, the act of vetting someone else's friends without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Trust is fundamental in a relationship, and if he's not trusting Jenna's judgment, that could be problematic. \n\nHe mentions he's checking out the guys' intentions, but does he have a valid reason? He says he knows at least one guy is interested in her romantically. But how does he know that? Is it based on Jenna's own disclosures, or is he just assuming? If Jenna is aware of these guys and doesn't see a problem, his intervention without discussing it with her might be overstepping.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is justified because she feels he's being controlling. Even if his intentions are protective, doing this behind her back invades her privacy. Healthy relationships require open communication, and if he had concerns, he should have discussed them with her instead of taking matters into his own hands. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's making assumptions about the guys' intentions could lead to unnecessary jealousy and conflict. It's possible that Jenna's male friends are just friends, and his actions might make her feel disrespected or that he doesn't trust her. \n\nIn terms of control, even if it's not physical control, controlling someone's social interactions can be considered emotional control. The argument that he's not threatening doesn't negate the fact that his actions are invasive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting out of a lack of trust and insecurity, which is leading to behaviors that the girlfriend perceives as controlling and sexist. Without open communication and mutual agreement on boundaries, his actions are indeed overstepping. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
