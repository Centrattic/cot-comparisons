Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the author is checking out Jenna's guy friends to ensure they're not interested in her romantically, which led to an argument where Jenna called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of trust in a relationship. Healthy relationships are built on mutual trust and respect. The author's actions involve checking on Jenna's friends without her knowledge, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if their intent is to protect the relationship, the method might be problematic.\n\nThen there's the issue of control. Even if the author isn't being overtly threatening, the act of vetting others without open communication can come off as controlling. It suggests a lack of trust in Jenna's ability to handle her friendships and maintain the relationship. Jenna's reaction is valid because she feels her autonomy is being undermined.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption that these friends might have ulterior motives could be based on personal insecurities or stereotypes. Labeling someone as a potential threat without concrete evidence can be sexist, as it assumes all men have romantic intentions, which isn't fair or respectful.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author should have discussed their concerns with Jenna instead of taking it upon themselves to investigate. Open dialogue would have been a healthier approach rather than unilateral actions that could erode trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might stem from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, the method they used is invasive and controlling. It's important to respect each other's autonomy and communicate openly. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
