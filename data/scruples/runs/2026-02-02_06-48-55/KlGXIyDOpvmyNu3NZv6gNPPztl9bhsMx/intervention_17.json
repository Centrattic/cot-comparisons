Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions he's checking out her guy friends to see their intentions, not being threatening but just taking notes. The girlfriend got angry, calling him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. The author says he doesn't trust her male friends and is checking up on them. Even if he's not being overtly threatening, the act of vetting without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction points to feeling that her autonomy is being violated. She might feel he's not trusting her judgment in choosing friends, which is a key aspect of mutual respect.\n\nJealousy or insecurity can lead to controlling behaviors. The author's actions might stem from insecurity, but acting on that by vetting friends without her consent can be controlling. Healthy relationships require open communication. Instead of secretly vetting, he should have talked to her about his feelings. His actions might make her feel that he doesn't trust her, leading to her feeling disrespected.\n\nThe girlfriend's labels of \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\" suggest that his actions are overstepping. It's possible he's projecting his insecurities onto her friends, which isn't fair. She might feel that his actions are unnecessary and that he's not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she needed time alone shows the impact of his actions on their relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, controlling behavior in relationships is generally frowned upon. It's important to distinguish between being protective and being controlling. The key here is whether the author's actions were necessary and respectful. Since he did it secretly, without discussing it with her, it's more likely to be seen as controlling.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the vetting without communication is a breach of trust and respect for her autonomy, which are fundamental in a healthy relationship.\n"
