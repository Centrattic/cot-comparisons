Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So, first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author is checking out his girlfriend Jenna's male friends because he doesn't trust them. He mentions that some of them might be interested in Jenna romantically and he wants to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He says he's not threatening but just taking notes. However, Jenna found out and got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nSo the main question here is whether his actions are justified or if they cross into controlling behavior. Trust issues in relationships can be tricky. On one hand, it's natural to have concerns about others' intentions towards your partner. But the way he's handling it might be problematic. \n\nVetting someone's friends without their knowledge or consent can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if the intent is to protect the relationship, doing this behind the person's back and without discussing it openly can lead to trust issues. Jenna's reaction indicates that she feels her autonomy is being respected. She's allowed to have her own friendships, and her partner shouldn't be spying on them. \n\nControl issues often come into play when one partner tries to monitor or restrict the other's social circle without good reason. If there's no concrete evidence that these friends are a threat, just suspicion, then the author's actions might be overstepping. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and communication. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, he should talk to her about his concerns. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jenna's friends have a \"same story\" about him might indicate that his behavior is noticeable and intrusive. This could make her friends feel uncomfortable or target him, which isn't fair. \n\nSo considering all these points, the author's actions are likely making him the asshole here. He's acting out of distrust without addressing the root issues and respecting Jenna's autonomy. The answer should be A, meaning he is in the wrong.\n"
