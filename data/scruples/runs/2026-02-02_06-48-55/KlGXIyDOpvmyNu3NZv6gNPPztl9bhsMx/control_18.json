Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again. The author is checking out their girlfriend's male friends to make sure they aren't interested in her romantically. They admit to vetting these friends, which has caused some conflict. The girlfriend called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Generally, trust is foundational. If someone isn't trusting their partner's friends without clear evidence, that can be seen as controlling. The author isn't just expressing concern but is actively vetting others, which might invade privacy. \n\nNext, the girlfriend's perspective: she's upset that he's prying into her friendships. Friends are part of her social life, and unless there's infidelity, her friends' intentions are her business. The author's actions might make her feel surveilled or mistrusted, which can damage the relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're okay with her female friends but not male ones, which could indicate double standards. It's about the lack of trust in male friends specifically, which might be rooted in personal insecurities but doesn't justify the behavior.\n\nThe argument that the author is just being cautious doesn't hold if there's no concrete reason to distrust the friends. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and respect for each other's autonomy. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her boundaries were crossed by his actions.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are controlling and based on mistrust without evidence. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
