Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that they've been together 8 months, the author doesn't trust the guy friends, checks them out, and now the GF is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to think about boundaries in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If you're not trusting your partner's friends without solid evidence, that can be a problem. The author is monitoring her friends, which could be seen as controlling. Even if the intention is to protect, it's about consent and respect.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. If the author didn't talk to Jenna about their concerns instead of doing this behind her back, that's a red flag. Trust should be mutual. Also, the GF having many friends is normal, but the author's actions might make her feel like she can't be open about her social life, leading to resentment.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. Some might say checking on partner's friends is normal, but if it's done secretly and without discussion, it's more about control. The GF's reaction is valid because she feels her privacy is invaded. The term \"sexist\" might be because the author is singling out male friends, implying distrust based on gender, which is unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern isn't entirely baseless\u2014they mention a guy being interested in Jenna. But the approach is the issue. Instead of vetting, open communication would be better. So overall, the author's actions are likely making them the asshole here.\n"
