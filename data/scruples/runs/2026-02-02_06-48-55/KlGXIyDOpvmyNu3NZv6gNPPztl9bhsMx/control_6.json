Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's analyze this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The key points here are trust, control, and consent.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he doesn't trust his girlfriend's male friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. This could be seen as controlling behavior because he's monitoring her social circle without her consent. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and his actions might be eroding that trust.\n\nHe states he's not threatening but just taking notes. However, the girlfriend felt it was sexist and controlling. She's entitled to her feelings. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method of secretly vetting her friends without discussing it could be harmful. Healthy relationships require open communication, not surveillance.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014feeling the need for space and calling out the behavior\u2014indicates that his actions crossed a boundary. He should have discussed his concerns with her instead of taking it upon himself to investigate. His actions might also imply a lack of trust in her judgment, which is crucial in a partnership.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while stemming from concern, are likely controlling and invasive. The correct answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
