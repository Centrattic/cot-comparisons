Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that he's been vetting his girlfriend's male friends because he doesn't trust them. He's checking them out to make sure they're not trying to hit on his GF or maybe lead her into cheating. He's not threatening, just taking notes. His GF got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, etc.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key elements here. The guy is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge, right? That's the main issue. Trust is a big part of relationships, so if he's not trusting her friends, that could be a red flag. Even if his intentions are to protect, the act of vetting without her consent might be controlling. \n\nControl in relationships is often about respecting each other's autonomy. If he's checking on her friends, maybe he's overstepping. Also, the fact that she's upset and left for a couple of days shows that this is a significant issue for her. She might feel that her social circle is being policed, which can be invasive. \n\nAnother angle is trust. If he can't trust her with her friends, that might indicate deeper insecurities or issues in the relationship. Trust is supposed to be mutual. If he's constantly suspicious of her friends, it might not be their fault but his own lack of trust. \n\nBut wait, maybe he's just being cautious. He says he's not threatening, just observing. However, the act of vetting implies he's making judgments without discussing it with her. That could be seen as a violation of her privacy. Also, the fact that she felt the need to be alone after this suggests that his actions hurt her feelings or made her feel disrespected.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, controlling behavior is generally frowned upon. People in healthy relationships usually respect each other's boundaries and social interactions. Unless there's a history of infidelity or some valid reason for concern, monitoring a partner's friends can be seen as possessive. \n\nHe mentions that she's been with him for 8 months, so maybe there's not a long history to build trust. But even so, trust is important. If he can't trust her friends, maybe he should talk to her about his feelings instead of vetting them behind her back. Communication is key. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions are likely to be seen as controlling and disrespectful of his girlfriend's autonomy. He's making decisions based on his own suspicions without her input, which can damage the trust in the relationship. Therefore, the answer is probably A, he is in the wrong.\n"
