Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about vetting his girlfriend's male friends because he doesn't trust them. He mentions he's checking them out to see their intentions, making sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. Now, the girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If he's not trusting her without any evidence, that might be an issue. But some people are more insecure, so maybe that's part of it. However, the way he's handling it could be the problem. Vetting her friends sounds like he's secretly judging or maybe even snooping on them without her knowledge. That's a red flag for control and lack of trust, which can be toxic in relationships.\n\nThen, there's the concept of consent. He's not talking to her about this or getting her permission. Instead, he's doing it behind her back, which is probably why she's upset. Open communication is key. If he's worried, he should discuss it with her instead of taking unilateral actions. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She feels that his actions are sexist, implying that he's making assumptions about her male friends' intentions without considering her agency. She might view this as undermining her judgment or treating her like she can't make safe choices. The fact that she needed time alone shows the emotional impact of his behavior.\n\nThe argument could be that he's just being protective. But in healthy relationships, protection doesn't involve covertly vetting others. It's about mutual respect and trust. If he can't trust her without evidence, that's a sign of insecurity, not necessarily her wrongdoing. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions are controlling and lack transparency. The girlfriend is within her rights to be upset about being treated this way. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
