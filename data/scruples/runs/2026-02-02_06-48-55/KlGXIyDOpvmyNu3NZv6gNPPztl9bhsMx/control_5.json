Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the author, let's call him Alex, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends to ensure they have good intentions and aren't trying to hit on her or cause trouble. He's not threatening, just taking note, but Jenna got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now, they're trying to figure out if Alex is an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is Alex's actions of vetting Jenna's male friends. Trust is a big factor here. Alex doesn't trust Jenna's guy friends because he thinks some are interested in Jenna romantically, so he checks them out to prevent any issues. However, Jenna feels that this behavior is controlling and she's upset about it.\n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner is constantly checking up on the other's friends without being suspicious of the partner's loyalty, it can be seen as controlling. Alex's reasoning is that he wants to ensure her friends are \"good guys,\" but by doing so, he's assuming that these friends might have ulterior motives. This could imply a lack of trust in his girlfriend's ability to handle her own social relationships and friends' intentions.\n\nThe question is whether this vetting is justified. If Jenna hasn't given any reasons to distrust her friends, then Alex's actions are based on his own assumptions. Trusting a partner's judgment about their friends is important. Unless there's evidence that Jenna has a history of friends being inappropriate, his actions might be overstepping. Additionally, Jenna's reaction indicates that she values her autonomy and the trust between them.\n\nControl in a relationship can manifest in various ways, including monitoring or controlling the other's social interactions. Even if Alex isn't being overtly threatening, the act of vetting without Jenna's knowledge might be seen as a breach of her privacy and an assertion of control over her social life.\n\nHowever, some might argue that concern is natural, especially in a new relationship. The 8-month timeframe is relatively short, and it's not uncommon for people to feel insecure. But the method of addressing that insecurity\u2014by secretly vetting friends\u2014could be problematic. Open communication would be a healthier approach. Instead of doing behind-the-scenes checks, discussing his concerns with Jenna and working together to build trust would be better.\n\nJenna's perspective is that Alex's actions are sexist and controlling. This could imply that he's assuming all her male friends have romantic intentions, which might be a stereotype. It's important to consider if there's a double standard, like if Jenna isn't doing the same for his friends. If she's not, then Alex's actions are indeed controlling.\n\nIn conclusion, while Alex's intentions might stem from wanting to protect the relationship, his methods are likely overstepping boundaries, leading to a breach of trust. The answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
