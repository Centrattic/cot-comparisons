Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The person, let's call him Alex, is checking out his girlfriend Jenna's male friends because he doesn't trust them. He's not doing anything threatening, just taking note of them. The key points here are about trust, control, and privacy in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered healthy behavior in relationships. Trust is fundamental. If Alex is constantly vetting Jenna's friends without her knowledge, that could be seen as a lack of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method might be problematic. Checking up on someone without their consent can feel controlling and invasive. \n\nJenna's reaction is important here. She called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Those aren't minor accusations. Feeling the need to spend time alone because of his actions shows that his behavior has caused significant strain. The fact that she's back now but the argument still lingers suggests unresolved issues.\n\nAnother angle: in many relationships, both partners need to have the freedom to have friends without constant scrutiny. If Alex is doing this because he doesn't trust her male friends, it might indicate deeper insecurities that he needs to address himself, rather than projecting onto Jenna. It's possible that his actions are based on his own jealousy rather than any real evidence from Jenna's side.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's normal to have some concern about the people one's partner spends time with. But the line between concern and control is thin. The key difference here is whether the actions are communicated and agreed upon by both partners. Since Alex did this without Jenna knowing, it's a breach of trust on his part.\n\nAlso, considering the term \"controlling\" \u2013 if he's making unilateral decisions about who Jenna can be friends with based on his own judgment, that's definitely controlling. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he had discussed his concerns with Jenna and they came to a mutual understanding, that would be different. But doing it behind her back without her input is problematic.\n\nIn summary, while it's understandable to have some level of concern, the method Alex used (vetting without her knowledge) is likely crossing into controlling behavior. The fact that it caused her to leave for a couple of days shows the impact of his actions. Therefore, the answer would lean towards yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
