Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the guy doesn't trust her guy friends and checks them out to make sure they aren't hitting on her or leading her astray. The GF got mad, called him controlling, etc. The question is whether he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship dynamics. In healthy relationships, trust is key. The author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust because he's not trusting his girlfriend's judgment in choosing her friends. Even if he's just \"checking out\" the guys without confrontation, it's still invasion of privacy. He's monitoring her social circle, which can be controlling.\n\nHe mentions he's not threatening, just taking notes. But the intention is to surveil her friends' intentions towards her. That's problematic because it implies he doesn't trust his GF to handle her own friendships and that he's assuming the worst about her friends. This can lead to jealousy and control issues.\n\nThe GF's reaction is valid. Feeling that her partner is being sexist or controlling when he's targeting her male friends specifically. It's possible that the author is projecting his own insecuritys or has trust issues from past experiences. However, that doesn't justify his behavior in the current relationship.\n\nIn many cases, relationships require mutual trust and respect for each other's autonomy. The act of vetting friends without discussing it with the partner is a red flag. It can create a toxic environment where the girlfriend feels her social life is policed. The fact that she needed space shows that his actions caused her distress.\n\nThe answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong. He's overstepping by invading her friends' privacy and not trusting her. Healthy relationships don't require such surveillance. The author should work on building trust rather than monitoring others.\n"
