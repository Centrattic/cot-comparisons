Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author explains that he doesn't trust her guy friends, checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. His girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. He's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of relationships. The author mentions he doesn't trust her male friends, so he's taking steps to vet them. But the problem is, how he's doing this. If he's secretly checking out her friends, that's a red flag. Trust should be mutual. Even if he has concerns, approaching it without her knowledge or consent can be seen as controlling. \n\nHe says he's not threatening, just taking note. But his actions might be invasive. Maybe he's looking at their social media, asking friends about them, or something else that invades privacy. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel her autonomy is being questioned. She might think her friends are trustworthy, and his actions could be making her feel like she's being accused of something. \n\nThe key points: Is vetting without her knowledge okay? Is it controlling to monitor her friends? Healthy relationships involve trust. If he can't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that's a deeper issue. Also, the fact that he's singling out male friends as a group could be sexist, as he's assuming they all have bad intentions. His girlfriend's labels of sexist and controlling make sense in that context.\n\nSo, even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. Trust should be there, and if he can't trust her, maybe that's a sign of insecurity on his part. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
