Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cheat. The GF is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The question is whether he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key aspects. The main issue here is trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author is concerned about his girlfriend's fidelity and the intentions of her male friends. However, the method he's using\u2014vetting them\u2014could be seen as overstepping. \n\nVetting implies he's secretly investigating or judging her friends without her knowledge or consent. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, doing so without transparency can be controlling. Trust is a foundational element in relationships, and if he's not trusting her friends, that might indicate underlying trust issues. \n\nHis girlfriend's perspective is important too. She found out he was doing this, which led to her feeling disrespected. Being called controlling suggests that her autonomy is being invaded. The fact that she needed time alone shows the emotional impact of his actions.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that he's \"just making sure\" might not justify the invasion of privacy. Healthy relationships involve communication and mutual respect. If he had concerns, discussing them with her instead of vetting friends secretly would be more appropriate. \n\nIs there a cultural context? Some might argue that checking up on a partner's friends is common, but the method and secrecy matter. Also, the term \"paranoid\" from her side might indicate he's overreacting. \n\nIn conclusion, while his concerns might stem from care, the action of vetting without her knowledge breaches trust and boundaries. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong.\n"
