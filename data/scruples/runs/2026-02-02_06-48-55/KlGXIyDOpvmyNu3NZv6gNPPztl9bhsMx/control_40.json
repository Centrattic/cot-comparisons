Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is checking out his girlfriend's male friends to ensure they aren't trying to hit on her or cause trouble. He's not threatening, just taking note. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, what's the main issue here? Trust is a big one. In a relationship, mutual trust is crucial. The author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect, the act of vetting others without discussing it with his girlfriend could be controlling. \n\nControl in relationships is a red flag. By monitoring her friends, he might be infringing on her autonomy. People should have the freedom to choose their friends without being surveilled. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because being called controlling and paranoid isn't without merit if someone is checking up on their partner's social circle without consent.\n\nThe author might argue it's about feeling secure, but healthy relationships involve communication. Instead of secretly vetting friends, talking about his insecurities with Jenna would be better. His approach led to conflict, which suggests that his method is problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't trust her judgment in choosing friends could imply a lack of confidence in her, which is a two-way street in trust. She might feel he doesn't respect her ability to handle herself. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect, are controlling and lack transparency. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
