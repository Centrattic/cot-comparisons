Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions not trusting these friends and checking them out to prevent them from hitting on his girlfriend or causing issues. The girlfriend got upset, called him controlling and sexist, and they had a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge, which is a privacy issue. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, doing so without her consent can be seen as invasive. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and his actions might undermine that trust. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she feels her autonomy is being violated. \n\nThe author's justification is that he doesn't trust the male friends, but that doesn't mean he has the right to investigate them without her input. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them openly with his girlfriend instead of taking matters into his own hands. \n\nAlso, labeling the author as controlling or paranoid by the girlfriend makes sense because his actions (vetting without consent) can be seen as overstepping boundaries. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic. \n\nSo, considering these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because he violated his partner's privacy and autonomy without addressing his concerns through open communication. The answer should be A.\n"
