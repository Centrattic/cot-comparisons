Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he's been checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. His GF got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends, possibly through social media or other means. He's not threatening but taking notes. The girlfriend is upset because she feels he's overstepping. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a big component. If he's not trusting her, that could be an issue. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, his actions might be seen as controlling. The line between being protective and being controlling can be thin. \n\nHe mentions that he's okay with her having female friends but not male ones. That might indicate a double standard, which can be a problem. Also, the fact that her male friends report the same story about him suggests that his actions are noticeable and might be making the friends uncomfortable. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels disrespected. Trust issues from one partner can cause insecurity in the other. It's possible that the root of his distrust isn't addressed here. Maybe there's insecurity or past experiences causing him to act this way. However, acting on that without discussing it with his partner is problematic. \n\nIn healthy relationships, open communication is key. Instead of vetting her friends, he should talk to her about his feelings. If he's not trusting her, that's a bigger issue that needs addressing. His actions without her knowledge are likely to be seen as intrusive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are likely to be in the wrong because they involve surveillance and lack of trust, which can be controlling. The answer is A.\n"
