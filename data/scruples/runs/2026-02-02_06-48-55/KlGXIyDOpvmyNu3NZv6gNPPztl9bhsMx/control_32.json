Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with Jenna, and they've been together for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, thinks some might have romantic intentions. He checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or make her cheat. He's not threatening, just taking notes. There was a guy who seemed interested in her, and the author doesn't trust people like that around Jenna. He's okay with her female friends but not with guys. Jenna found out, got angry, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed time alone. Now they're back together, but he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break this down. First, the author is \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. That's the key action here. He's doing this because he doesn't trust them, thinking they might have bad intentions. But the problem arises when Jenna finds out and is upset, using specific labels like controlling and sexist.\n\nSo, from a relationship ethics perspective, what's the standard here? Generally, trust is a crucial component in a healthy relationship. If one partner is constantly checking on the other's friends or interactions without their knowledge, that can be seen as a breach of trust and an invasion of privacy. Even if the intentions are to protect, the method might be problematic.\n\nIn most relationships, partners should communicate openly about their feelings and concerns. The author didn't talk to Jenna about his concerns but instead decided to \"vet\" her friends on his own. That lack of communication could lead to misunderstandings and resentment. Jenna's reaction of being angry and needing space makes sense because she might feel her autonomy is being violated.\n\nThe author might argue that it's about protecting the relationship, but if the girlfriend isn't aware of the vetting, it's a form of surveillance. Even if he's not threatening, just taking notes is a form of monitoring. This could be seen as controlling because he's trying to manage her interactions without her input. \n\nAlso, the term \"sexist\" might apply if the author is making assumptions about all male friends based on gender, which could be a stereotype. If he's assuming all guys want to hit on her or cheat, that's a generalization. \n\nOn the flip side, some might say that being cautious is okay, especially if there's a specific reason to be concerned. But the problem here is that the author is acting on his own without discussing it with Jenna. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust, which includes respecting each other's social circles unless there's a clear and present danger, which isn't indicated here.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be a sign of insecurity or lack of trust in the relationship. If the relationship is stable and Jenna isn't acting in a way that's suspicious, the author's behavior might stem from personal issues rather than any actual threat. \n\nJenna's response is valid because she's expressing her boundaries. If the author is making her feel like she's being monitored, that's a significant issue in the relationship. The fact that she needed time alone shows the impact of his actions. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions are likely in the wrong because he's violating trust and autonomy without communication. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
