Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend Jenna have been together 8 months. He's checking out her male friends to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not threatening, just taking notes. One guy seemed interested in her, so he doesn't trust him. Jenna got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. She needed time alone but came back. Now he's questioning if he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust, boundaries, and control in a relationship. The author's actions involve monitoring his girlfriend's friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not confrontational, the act of vetting without her consent can be seen as controlling. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship. If he doesn't trust her friends, that might indicate underlying issues in the relationship, like insecurity or lack of trust in Jenna herself.\n\nChecking up on someone's friends, especially without their knowledge, can infringe on their privacy. Jenna's reaction suggests that she felt her autonomy was respected. Calling him sexist and controlling implies that she feels he's imposing his judgment without cause. The author's justification is that he wants to protect the relationship, but it's important to consider if this is his way of maintaining control rather than building trust.\n\nIn healthy relationships, open communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing his concerns with Jenna would have been a better approach. His actions might have been perceived as a lack of faith in her judgment and loyalty. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic because it breaches trust and autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jenna needed time alone shows the impact of his actions on their relationship. While he's not being overtly abusive, the behavior crosses into controlling territory by undermining her relationships. It's possible he's projecting his own insecurities onto her friends, which isn't her friends' fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions, though stemming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, are controlling and lack transparency. They don't respect Jenna's autonomy and have caused conflict. So the answer should be A.\n"
