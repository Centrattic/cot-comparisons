Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author says they're checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. They mention that their girlfriend, Jenna, got upset, called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is monitoring their girlfriend's friends, which can be seen as a form of jealousy or lack of trust. In relationships, trust is a big component. If someone is constantly checking up on their partner's social circle, especially friends of the opposite sex, that can come off as controlling. The author isn't just being cautious; they're actively vetting people without the partner's knowledge. That crosses into controlling behavior because it's about maintaining control over who their partner interacts with rather than trusting them.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's reaction. She felt it was sexist because she might believe that the author is assuming all her male friends have bad intentions. Controlling behavior is when you restrict a partner's autonomy, and by vetting her friends, the author is limiting her social interactions. Paranoia could stem from the author's lack of trust, leading to unnecessary suspicion.\n\nThe author also mentions they're okay with her having female friends but not male ones, which adds to the sexism angle. It's a double standard. The key issue here is trust. Healthy relationships require mutual trust. If the author can't trust Jenna's judgment regarding her friends, that's a problem. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to take a break shows the impact of this behavior on the relationship.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might feel insecure about their position in the relationship. Maybe they have past experiences or personal insecurities that drive their actions. However, acting on those insecurities by vetting friends without communication is not healthy. The right approach would be to talk to Jenna about their feelings instead of sneaking around to check up on her friends.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are controlling and lack trust, which are generally viewed as negative in relationships. Even if the intention is to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
