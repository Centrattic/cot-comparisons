Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The question is whether the author (AITA) is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is checking out their girlfriend Jenna's male friends to ensure they're not hitting on her or causing issues. Jenna got upset, called him controlling, etc., and he's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for confirmation. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, analyzing this: Trust is a big part of relationships. The author's actions might be seen as invasive. Checking on Jenna's friends without her knowledge or consent could be controlling. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. It's about respect for her autonomy and privacy. The fact that Jenna felt the need to spend time alone suggests the actions hurt her. Jealousy or lack of trust can be issues, but acting on it by vetting friends without discussion is likely not healthy. The author should have communicated his concerns instead of doing it secretly. So, the answer leans towards A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
