Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for \"vetting\" his girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out her guy friends to see if they have bad intentions, like hitting on her or causing problems. The girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for 8 months. The author's actions involve checking out her male friends, not confronting them or being overtly controlling. He says he's not threatening, just taking notes. But the girlfriend felt it was invasive and controlling, leading to an argument.\n\nTrust is a key factor here. In a healthy relationship, trust is essential. If one partner is constantly vetting the other's friends, it can signal a lack of trust, which might be a red flag. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method of \"vetting\" without her knowledge might be intrusive and disrespectful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling that her partner is judging her friends without her consent can lead to feelings of being controlled or not trusted. The term \"sexist\" might be harsh, but if the author is targeting her male friends more than her female friends, that could imply a gender bias. However, the core issue is about privacy and autonomy in the relationship.\n\nThe author's justification is based on concern, but the approach is problematic. Healthy relationships involve communication rather than covert actions. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing his insecurities with his girlfriend would be a better approach. The fact that she needed space shows that his actions hurt her, which supports the idea that he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions breach trust and respect in the relationship.\n"
