Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The scenario is that he's been checking out her guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. His girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and if he doesn't trust her friends, that's a red flag. But why doesn't he trust them? He mentions that he knows some of them are interested in her. However, vetting them by checking them out could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method might be problematic.\n\nWhat's the line between being cautious and being controlling? If he's not confronting her about it directly but is instead surveilling her friends, that crosses into controlling behavior. Healthy relationships involve trust and communication. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, he should address his concerns with her openly. By doing this behind her back, he's not respecting her autonomy and the trust she expects from him.\n\nAlso, the fact that his actions led to an argument shows that this approach is causing harm. She felt that he was being sexist, which could imply that he's assuming all male friends have ulterior motives, which is a stereotype. That's definitely a problem. Trusting someone means believing they can make good choices without constant oversight.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of his actions\u2014her needing time alone\u2014indicate that his actions were hurtful. Even though they reconciled, the underlying issue of his mistrust remains. It's important to consider whether his actions are based on past experiences or insecurity. However, in a healthy relationship, trust should be the default. If he can't trust her, that could lead to ongoing issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are likely controlling and a breach of trust, making him wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
