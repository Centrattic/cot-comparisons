Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his GF, Jenna, have been together 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, so he checks them out to see if they have bad intentions, like hitting on her or causing issues. He mentions not being threatening, just taking note. However, Jenna found out, got angry, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. Now he's conflicted about whether he's wrong.\n\nSo the main issue here is about trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author's actions involve investigating his partner's friends, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method might be problematic. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and acting on distrust without discussing it openly can harm the relationship.\n\nHe mentions that Jenna's male friends have the same story about him. That might indicate that the friends perceive his behavior as controlling or suspicious, which could make them feel uncomfortable or judged. Jenna's reaction is valid because being monitored or vetted without consent can feel controlling and disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't discuss his concerns with Jenna before taking action, which led to her feeling disrespected. Even if the friends might have had some interest in Jenna, the author's approach of secretly vetting them instead of talking to her could undermine trust.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address insecurities through open communication rather than covert actions. The author's actions, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, may have crossed into controlling behavior by not respecting Jenna's autonomy and privacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
