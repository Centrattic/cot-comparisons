Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author says he checks out her male friends to make sure they don't hit on her or do worse. His girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed space. Now he's asking if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are trust, control, and mutual respect in a relationship. Vetting someone else's friends can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect his girlfriend, the act of checking up on her friends without her knowledge or consent might cross a boundary. It's important to note that healthy relationships require trust. If he doesn't trust her friends, that might indicate underlying trust issues in the relationship, which isn't his girlfriend's fault. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant. She felt that his actions were controlling and sexist. Controlling behavior often involves trying to manage or monitor a partner's social interactions without their input. Calling someone \"controlling\" is a strong accusation and suggests that she felt her autonomy was being undermined. Even if the author's intentions were protective, the method of secretly vetting friends without discussing it with her first could be problematic. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. If the author had concerns about her friends, he should have discussed them openly with her instead of taking it upon himself to investigate. By doing the vetting behind her back, he bypassed her agency in the matter. This could make her feel that her choices are being questioned or controlled, leading to feelings of distrust and resentment.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that her male friends might have romantic intentions. While it's natural to have jealousy, making assumptions without evidence can lead to unnecessary conflicts. The author might be projecting his own insecurities onto her friends, which isn't a fair approach. Trusting a partner's judgment and choices is crucial. If the author doesn't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that might reflect more on his own insecurities than any wrongdoing by her friends.\n\nThe term \"sexist\" is also worth considering. If the author is applying different standards to her male friends versus her female friends, that could be a point of sexism. However, the post doesn't mention different treatment, just vetting male friends. Still, the act of surveillance regardless of gender could be seen as controlling. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should feel secure without needing to monitor each other's social circles. The author's actions might stem from a place of insecurity or lack of trust, which are personal issues he might need to address. The fact that his girlfriend needed time alone shows that his actions hurt her, and even if they're back together, the underlying issue might still be a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were likely overstepping boundaries. He didn't communicate his concerns, instead chose to act on them secretly, leading to feelings of control and lack of trust. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps strong, is a valid response to being monitored without consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
