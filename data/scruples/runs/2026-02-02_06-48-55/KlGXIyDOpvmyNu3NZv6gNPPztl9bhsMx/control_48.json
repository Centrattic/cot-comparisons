Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The scenario is that they don't trust the guy friends, check them out to make sure they aren't hitting on her or something. The GF got mad, called them sexist, controlling, paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If one partner is constantly checking the other's friends, that could be seen as controlling. The guy's actions might be invading the girlfriend's privacy. Even if he's not threatening, just taking notes on her friends' intentions might make her feel disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's just trying to protect the relationship. But where's the line between protection and control? Jealousy can lead to controlling behavior. The fact that she's upset and felt the need for space suggests that his actions crossed a boundary. Also, the assumption that all her male friends might have ulterior motives could be sexist, as it generalizes all men. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because trust and autonomy are important. If he's not being transparent about his actions, that's a problem. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic. So overall, the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
