Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is wrong. The situation is about the person vetting their girlfriend's male friends because they don't trust them. The author checks out the guys to make sure they aren't interested in Jenna romantically or have bad intentions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in relationships. Trust is a fundamental part of any healthy partnership. If one partner feels the need to monitor or investigate the other's friends, especially of the opposite sex, that can be a sign of insecurity or lack of trust. The author mentions they're not threatening but just taking notes. However, even if their intentions are to protect the relationship, the act of secretly vetting friends without the girlfriend's knowledge might be controlling or invasive.\n\nThe girlfriend felt that the author was sexist, controlling, and paranoid. She asked for space, which the author might not have respected by not considering her feelings. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust because Jenna wasn't informed about the vetting process. In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate openly about their concerns rather than taking unilateral actions.\n\nAlso, the author's rationale is based on distrust, which might stem from personal insecurities. While it's natural to care about one's partner's interactions, the method of secretly checking on friends without discussion could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt her autonomy was being questioned, which is a valid concern.\n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground where the author could express their concerns without invasive actions. For example, discussing with Jenna about their worries and setting boundaries together. Since the author didn't do that and instead acted on their own, it's likely they overstepped. The key point is that trust and mutual respect are essential, and unilateral actions without communication can damage the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong (A) because their actions were controlling and violated trust without open communication.\n"
