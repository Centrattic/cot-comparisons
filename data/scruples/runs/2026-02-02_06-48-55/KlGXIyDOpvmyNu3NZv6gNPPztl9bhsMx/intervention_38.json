Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't trust their GF's guy friends and check them out to see their intentions. They claim they're not threatening, just taking notes. The GF got upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now they're questioning if they are an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust issues and privacy. In a healthy relationship, mutual trust is essential. The act of \"vetting\" someone else's friends without their knowledge can be seen as controlling. Even if the intention is to protect the relationship, doing so without open communication might be overstepping. The GF felt it was an invasion of her privacy, leading to her needing space. \n\nThe author's actions might stem from jealousy or insecurity, which are common, but how they handle it matters. Checking on someone else's friends without their consent can breach trust. The GF's reaction is valid because it's about her autonomy and how she feels respected in the relationship. \n\nSo, while the author's concern might be relatable, the method they used is problematic. Respecting boundaries is crucial. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
