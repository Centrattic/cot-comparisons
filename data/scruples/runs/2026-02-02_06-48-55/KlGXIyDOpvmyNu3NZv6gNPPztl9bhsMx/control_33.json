Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The guy is checking out their intentions, not being threatening, just taking note. The girlfriend got mad, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The question is whether he's an asshole or not.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy is in an 8-month relationship. His girlfriend has male friends, and he doesn't trust them. He checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The GF is upset, and they had an argument. Now, the user is asking if the author is wrong.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is checking the other's friends' intentions without their knowledge, that can be seen as a breach of trust. The guy might think he's being protective, but the GF feels controlled. The term \"controlling\" is a red flag. Also, the fact that the GF found out he was doing this suggests that he might be invading her privacy. \n\nEven if his intention is to protect, the method of doing so without her knowledge is problematic. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them with her instead of vetting her friends behind her back. The GF's reaction is valid because it's her right to be upset about being monitored. \n\nThe guy's actions, regardless of intent, can be seen as violating her trust. The fact that he's not threatening but just \"taking note\" doesn't mitigate the issue. The GF's autonomy and privacy are important. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. So, answer A (Yes).\n"
