Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The person, let's call him Alex, is checking out Jenna's guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. He didn't confront them directly but just observed. Now, Jenna is upset, saying he's sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental. If Alex doesn't trust Jenna's friends without her knowledge, that could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, doing it without her consent might be controlling. \n\nBut then again, some level of concern is normal. Maybe Alex feels insecure or has had past experiences that make him wary. The key here is whether his actions are respectful and communicated. Since he didn't talk to Jenna about his feelings and instead took it upon himself to vet the friends, that's where the issue lies. It's about respecting her autonomy and the boundaries of each other's social circles.\n\nAlso, Jenna's reaction is valid. Feeling that her partner is scrutinizing her friends without her input can be hurtful. It might imply a lack of trust in her judgment, which can damage the relationship. The term \"controlling\" is a strong one, but if he's making decisions based on his observations without discussing, that could be controlling behavior.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe Alex is just being cautious. But healthy relationships require communication. Instead of secretly vetting friends, he should have discussed his concerns with Jenna. They could have come up with a mutual understanding. His actions, while perhaps stemming from a place of wanting to protect, are unilateral and not transparent, which is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because his actions, while maybe well-intentioned, are controlling and lack communication, which is essential in a healthy relationship.\n"
