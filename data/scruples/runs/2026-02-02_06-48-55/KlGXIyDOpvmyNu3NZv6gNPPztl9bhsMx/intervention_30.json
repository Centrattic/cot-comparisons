Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't trust them, wants to make sure they don't hit on her, or worse, cause her to cheat. The girlfriend called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Jealousy and trust are common in relationships, but where does it cross the line into inappropriate behavior? Checking out friends might involve looking up their social media, maybe stalking them, or even confronting the girlfriend about them. The key here is that the author is secretly vetting without her consent. That's a big issue because it's a violation of trust and privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling that her partner is being judgmental about her friends can be seen as controlling. It's possible the author is projecting his own insecurities onto others. Also, the assumption that all her male friends are a threat is sexist because it generalizes all men based on a few, which is unfair. \n\nControl in a relationship shouldn't involve surveillance or dictating who one's partner can be friends with. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and respect. The author's actions could erode the girlfriend's trust in him, even if his intentions are \"good.\" It's important to communicate concerns openly rather than secretly vetting others. \n\nThe answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the actions are controlling and lack transparency. Even if his intentions are protective, the method is invasive and undermines trust.\n"
