Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for checking up on their girlfriend's male friends. The author mentions they don't trust the guys and want to make sure their intentions are good. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the act of \"vetting\" friends without the partner's knowledge might infringe on her autonomy. Relationships require mutual trust, and if one partner is secretly checking up on the other's friends, that could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend felt it was sexist and controlling, which suggests that her boundaries were crossed. Checking their intentions could come off as paranoia if there's no concrete reason to suspect wrongdoing. \n\nEven if the author's intention is to protect the relationship, the method of doing so without open communication might be problematic. Healthy relationships involve discussing concerns rather than acting on them behind the partner's back. The fact that the girlfriend reacted strongly and needed time alone indicates that this behavior hurt her feelings and made her feel disrespected. \n\nSo, while the author might not be malicious, their actions lack transparency and respect for their partner's social circle. It's about balancing personal insecurities with the partner's right to have friends without surveillance. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their actions were controlling and breached trust.\n"
