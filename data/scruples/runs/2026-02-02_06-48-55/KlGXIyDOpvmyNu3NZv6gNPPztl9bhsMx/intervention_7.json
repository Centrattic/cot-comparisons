Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through their situation carefully. They're in a relationship with Jenna, who has male friends. The author doesn't trust these friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause problems. They mention they're not threatening but just taking note. However, Jenna got upset, called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The author is now questioning if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author is \"vetting\" their girlfriend's male friends. That term \"vetting\" implies a process of evaluating or checking suitability, which in this context is done without the partner's knowledge. The author is doing this because they don't trust the intentions of these friends, suspecting some might be interested in the girlfriend romantically. They're not acting on it by threatening but are just observing and noting. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is upset and labels the behavior as controlling and sexist. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics perspective, trust is a fundamental component. If one partner is constantly checking on the other's friends and their intentions without discussing it openly, that can be seen as controlling. The author isn't communicating their concerns with Jenna but instead taking unilateral action. This lack of communication can lead to feelings of being monitored or distrust. \n\nThe author's justification is that they want to ensure these friends aren't up to something. However, the method they're using\u2014without consent\u2014might be problematic. Even if the intentions are good (like wanting to protect the relationship), the approach could be invasive. It's possible that Jenna values her autonomy and doesn't appreciate her partner scrutinizing her friends without her knowledge. \n\nThe term \"controlling\" is often used when someone exerts unnecessary influence over another's decisions or social interactions. By vetting Jenna's friends, the author might be infringing on her right to maintain her own social circle without interference. This could lead to feeling smothered or not trusted by the partner, which is a valid reason for Jenna to be upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they're just being cautious. But in healthy relationships, open communication about concerns is key. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing the discomfort around certain friends and setting boundaries together might be a better approach. \n\nThe author mentions that the male friends \"have the same story about me.\" This could imply that the friends are aware the author is checking them out, which might have caused tension. However, if the author's actions are leading to others having similar stories about them, that might reflect poorly on the author's behavior. \n\nThe girlfriend called the author sexist, which could relate to assuming that all male friends have ulterior motives. Assuming the worst about people based on their gender is a form of sexism. By not trusting all male friends, the author might be reinforcing stereotypes about men's intentions, which is discriminatory. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might stem from a desire to protect the relationship, the method of secretly vetting the girlfriend's friends without her knowledge and possibly with sexist assumptions is problematic. This behavior can be seen as controlling and invasive, leading to justified upset in the girlfriend. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
