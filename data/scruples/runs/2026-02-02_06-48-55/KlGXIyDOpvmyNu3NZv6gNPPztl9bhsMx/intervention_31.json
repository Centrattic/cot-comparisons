Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author explains they've been together 8 months, and they don't trust her male friends. They check them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The GF got upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jealousy or lack of trust in a relationship isn't uncommon, but the way it's handled matters. The author isn't just feeling jealous; they're actively vetting the friends. That implies some form of surveillance or investigation without the GF's knowledge. Even if the author is just \"taking note,\" it's likely that the GF feels her privacy is invaded. \n\nThe GF's reaction is important. She called the author sexist and controlling. That suggests she feels he's making assumptions about her male friends based on their gender, which is a form of sexism. Controlling behavior usually involves trying to manage or limit someone's actions without their consent. If the author is monitoring or investigating her friends without her knowledge or agreement, that's controlling. \n\nThe author mentions they're not threatening but just \"taking note.\" However, the GF might not know that; she found out through the friends' stories, which could mean the author's actions were covert. Even if the intent is to protect, the method is invasive. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect and communication. Instead of vetting friends, the author should discuss their concerns with Jenna. If Jenna feels the need for space, that's a sign of the author's lack of trust, which can erode the relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they're okay with female friends but not male ones points to gender bias. That's a form of sexism because it assumes all men have ulterior motives, which isn't fair to the male friends or the GF. \n\nIn relationships, controlling behavior is generally seen as a negative trait. Even if the author's intentions are to protect, the method is problematic. The GF's right to have friends and privacy is being undermined. So, the author's actions are likely wrong. The correct answer would be A.\n"
