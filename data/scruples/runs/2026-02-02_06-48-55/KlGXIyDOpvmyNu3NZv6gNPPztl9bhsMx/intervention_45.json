Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, Jenna, have been together for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not threatening but just taking note. One guy seemed interested in her, and he doesn't trust such people. Jenna got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. They've resolved it, but he's questioning if he was right.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about trust, control, and boundaries in a relationship. The author's actions involve monitoring his girlfriend's friends, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if he's not threatening, the act of vetting someone else's friends without their knowledge can be controlling. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and if he's not trusting Jenna's judgment about her friends, that's a problem. \n\nJenna's reaction is valid because she feels her autonomy is being questioned. By vetting her friends, he's implying that her friends aren't trustworthy, which can be sexist as it assumes all men have bad intentions. It also shows a lack of trust in her ability to manage her own friendships. Even if his intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. Healthy relationships involve communication and mutual trust, not surveillance. \n\nSo, the author's actions are controlling and not healthy. The answer should be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
