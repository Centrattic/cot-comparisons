Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The scenario is from a Reddit AITA post where the author is checking out Jenna's guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they don't trust the male friends, so they're checking them out. They\u2019re not threatening but just taking notes. The girlfriend is upset, calling the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The key points here are invasion of privacy, trust issues, and control in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If someone is feeling the need to monitor their partner's friends, especially without their consent, that can be seen as controlling behavior. The author is essentially surveilling Jenna's interactions, which can erode trust and make her feel disrespected. Even though the intention is to protect, the method is problematic. It's not about the content of the friends' actions but the act of vetting itself without open communication.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is a red flag. She felt the need to take a break from the relationship, indicating that the behavior crossed a boundary. The author's justification is based on not trusting the friends, but in a healthy relationship, the trust should be between the partners, not placing suspicion on the partner's friends.\n\nAlso, the author's perspective seems to assume that all male friends might have ulterior motives, which could be sexist as it stereotypes men as potential threats. This generalization can contribute to a controlling mindset. The fact that the girlfriend pointed out sexism suggests the author's behavior was discriminatory in nature.\n\nEven if the author isn't overtly threatening, the act of vetting without consent can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Healthy relationships involve open communication rather than covert monitoring. The author should have discussed their concerns with Jenna instead of acting on them unilaterally.\n\nSo considering all these factors\u2014control, lack of consent, invasion of privacy, and stereotyping\u2014it seems the author is indeed in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
