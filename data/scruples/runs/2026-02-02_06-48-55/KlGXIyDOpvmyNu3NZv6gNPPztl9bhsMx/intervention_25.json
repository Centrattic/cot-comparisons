Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend Jenna have been together for 8 months. The author doesn't trust Jenna's male friends, thinking some might have romantic intentions. They check out these guys to make sure they don't hit on her or cause problems. Jenna found out and got upset, calling the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid. They had a fight, but things are calm now. The author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key elements here. The main issue is the author's actions of \"vetting\" Jenna's male friends. Is this an acceptable action or overstepping? Let's think about trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental. If the author is checking up on Jenna's friends without her knowledge, it might be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention is to protect the relationship, the method of doing so without transparency could be problematic.\n\nThe author mentions they're not threatening, just taking notes. But the fact that Jenna discovered they were doing this and felt the need to be alone suggests it caused her emotional distress. The labels she used\u2014sexist, controlling, paranoid\u2014indicate she feels her autonomy is being invaded. Controlling behavior can be a red flag in relationships. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of secretly vetting her friends might be controlling and disrespectful of her independence.\n\nAnother angle: the author's lack of trust. If the author doesn't trust Jenna's judgment in choosing friends, that could be a deeper issue. Healthy relationships require mutual trust. The author's actions might stem from insecurity or jealousy, which are common, but acting on them in a controlling way isn't healthy. Open communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting, discussing concerns with Jenna would be a better approach.\n\nAlso, Jenna's reaction is a sign that the author's actions crossed a boundary. Even if the author thought it was for the best, Jenna's perspective matters. Her feelings of being controlled and untrusted are valid. The author should consider that Jenna's male friends might be innocent, and the author's actions could make her feel like she's being judged or mistrusted without cause.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most would argue that while it's natural to have some level of concern for a partner's social circle, taking it to the point of secretly vetting others without their consent is overstepping. It's important to respect a partner's autonomy and social life unless there's a clear, proven issue. The author's approach seems preemptive and potentially harmful to the relationship's trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are likely in the wrong. They're acting out of mistrust and controlling behavior, which can erode the relationship's foundation. Even if the intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is inappropriate and disrespectful. The answer would be A.\n"
