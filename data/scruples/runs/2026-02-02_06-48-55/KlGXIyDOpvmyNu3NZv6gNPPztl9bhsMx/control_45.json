Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend, Jenna, have been together 8 months. The author doesn't trust her male friends, so they check them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. They mention they're not threatening but just taking notes. One guy seemed interested in Jenna, and the author doesn't trust him. Jenna got upset, calling the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The author is now conflicted and wants to know if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's acceptable in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part. If the author is constantly checking up on Jenna's friends without her knowledge, that could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if their intentions are to protect the relationship, the method might be problematic. \n\nThe author's actions might be considered controlling if they're not being transparent. Checking someone's friends without their awareness can be invasive. It suggests a lack of trust in Jenna, which can erode the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014feeling that it's sexist, controlling, and paranoid\u2014points to her feeling that her autonomy is being questioned. \n\nAlso, 8 months is a significant time to build trust. If there's an underlying issue here, like insecurity or past experiences, the author might need to address those directly with Jenna instead of acting on them covertly. The fact that Jenna noticed the pattern of the guys' stories about the author indicates that the vetting is too obvious, which could make her feel that her friends are being unfairly judged.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that checking the intentions of a partner's friends is normal, especially if there's a legitimate concern. However, the key here is the method and the lack of communication. The author didn't discuss their concerns with Jenna, leading to her feeling that her friends are being spied on. Trust in a relationship requires open communication. Instead of covertly vetting friends, the author should have talked to Jenna about their insecurities and set boundaries together.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are based on valid reasons or insecurity. If there's no evidence of previous issues with Jenna's friends, the author's behavior might stem from personal insecurity rather than actual threats. That makes it more about their own trust issues than a genuine problem with Jenna's friends.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect the relationship, the approach is problematic. The covert vetting without discussion is a breach of trust and can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her autonomy and her friends' privacy are being invaded. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
