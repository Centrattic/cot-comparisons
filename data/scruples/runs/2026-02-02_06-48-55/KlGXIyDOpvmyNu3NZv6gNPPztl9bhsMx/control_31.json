Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author explains they don't trust her guy friends, check them out to ensure they aren't hitting on her or leading her to cheat. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. Now they're back together but he's questioning if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if his actions are justified. The key here is the concept of trust in a relationship. If he's checking out her friends without her knowledge, that's a breach of trust. Even if his intention is to protect, the method is problematic. Jealousy and controlling behavior can be red flags. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel disrespected and not trusted. \n\nAlso, the idea that some guys might have romantic interest in her is normal, but the author taking it upon himself to vet them implies a lack of trust in their relationship. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and communication. If he has concerns, he should discuss them with her instead of doing his own investigation. \n\nThe author might argue it's about protecting the relationship, but the way he's handling it is invasive. The girlfriend's feelings of being controlled and the use of terms like \"sexist\" and \"paranoid\" suggest that his actions are overstepping. \n\nSo, overall, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions are controlling and based on distrust, which can harm the relationship. The answer would be A.\n"
