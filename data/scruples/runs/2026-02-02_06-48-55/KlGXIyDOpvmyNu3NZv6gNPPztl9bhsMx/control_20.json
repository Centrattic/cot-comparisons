Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he doesn't trust her guy friends and checks them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. They're in an 8-month relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not being overtly threatening, the act of vetting without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust. In healthy relationships, open communication is important. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them with her instead of doing it behind her back.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because being monitored without consent can feel controlling. The term \"controlling\" is often used when someone tries to manage a partner's social interactions without their input. Even if his intentions are to protect, the method is invasive. Trust is a two-way street; if he doesn't trust her friends, it might indicate deeper insecurities or issues in their relationship that need addressing through communication, not surveillance.\n\nAlso, the fact that she noticed and confronted him shows she values her autonomy. His actions might not be malicious, but they're disrespectful of her boundaries. The argument that he's just \"checking out\" the guys doesn't justify the lack of transparency. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and trust, and his actions undermine that by implying he doesn't trust her judgment in choosing friends.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's concerned and wants to protect her. However, protection shouldn't come at the expense of her autonomy. The line between concern and control is thin here. Since his actions led to conflict and hurt feelings, it's likely he overstepped. The answer would be that he's in the wrong because his actions were controlling and lacked communication.\n"
