Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he's been checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or try to get her to cheat. He's not threatening, just taking note, and he mentions one guy who seemed interested in her. His GF got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his girlfriend have been together 8 months. He's worried about her male friends, which is a common concern in relationships. But does his action cross the line into controlling behavior? \n\nVetting friends can be seen as a form of jealousy or insecurity. While it's natural to have concerns about a partner's interactions, acting on those concerns by investigating their friends might invade her privacy. The key issue here is consent and communication. If he hasn't discussed his feelings with her openly and instead is doing this behind the scenes, it could be perceived as controlling. \n\nTrust is a fundamental part of any relationship. If he doesn't trust her judgment in choosing friends, that's a problem. Also, assuming that her male friends have \"the same story about him\" might indicate a bias or paranoia, as she called him paranoid. The fact that she felt the need to take time alone suggests that his actions made her uncomfortable. \n\nAnother point is that he's okay with her having female friends but not male ones, which could be seen as sexist, as she mentioned. It's important to treat both partners equally in terms of social interactions. Controlling behavior often involves restricting the other person's autonomy, which he's doing by monitoring her friends without her knowledge.\n\nHowever, maybe he's just trying to protect the relationship. But healthy relationships require open communication, not surveillance. The right approach would be discussing his insecurities with her rather than investigating her friends. His actions might erode her trust in him, making her question why he can't trust her friends.\n\nIn conclusion, while he might have good intentions, his actions are likely overstepping, violating her privacy, and creating a controlling atmosphere. The answer is probably A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
