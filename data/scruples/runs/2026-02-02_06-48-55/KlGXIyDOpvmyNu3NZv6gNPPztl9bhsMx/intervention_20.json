Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The scenario is from a Reddit AMAITA post.\n\nFirst, the author is checking out his GF's male friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. He's not threatening, just noting them. His GF got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The user says they think the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A or B. \n\nIn relationships, trust is key. If the author is spying or monitoring his GF's friends without her knowledge, that's a problem. Control and jealousy can be red flags. Even if his intentions are to protect, invading privacy or being overbearing is usually seen as controlling. The GF has a right to her social circle. Unless there's actual evidence the friends are a problem, the author's actions might be unnecessary. The fact that the GF felt the need to ask for space shows the action was intrusive. So, likely A: Yes, the author is wrong.\n"
