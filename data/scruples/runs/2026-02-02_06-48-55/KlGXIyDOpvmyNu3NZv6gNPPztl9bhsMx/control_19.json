Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that they've been together 8 months, she has male friends, and he doesn't trust them. He checks them out to make sure they're not hitting on her or causing issues. She got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is monitoring his girlfriend's male friends without her knowledge. Even if he's not confronting them or being threatening, the act of vetting without her consent is probably a problem. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect and honesty. By secretly checking her friends, he's showing a lack of trust, which can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend has a right to her own friendships, and his actions might make her feel that her autonomy is being invaded.\n\nAlso, 8 months into the relationship, it's a bit early to be so concerned about her friends. It could indicate insecurity or jealousy. The fact that she felt the need to take time alone suggests that his actions hurt her. The labels he's given\u2014sexist, controlling\u2014might be valid if he's judging her friends based on gender stereotypes or trying to control her social interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's just trying to protect the relationship. But the key here is the method. Open communication about his concerns would be better than covert surveillance. If he had discussed his feelings with her, they could have addressed it together. His approach seems to lack trust and could undermine the relationship's foundation.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. Vetting friends without consent breaches that trust. So, the answer is likely A\u2014he's in the wrong.\n"
