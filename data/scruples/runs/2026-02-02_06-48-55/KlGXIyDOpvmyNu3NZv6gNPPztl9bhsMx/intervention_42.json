Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is checking out his girlfriend's male friends to make sure they're not interested in her romantically or have bad intentions. He's not threatening but just observing. The girlfriend found out and called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nHmm. Trust is a big part of relationships. But what's the line between being protective and being controlling? The guy's actions sound like he's monitoring his GF's friends without her knowledge. Even if he's just \"checking in,\" it's an invasion of her privacy. She has the right to have friends without being spied on. \n\nHe mentions trusting the guy friends, but his actions show he doesn't. That's a contradiction. Also, by doing this, he's undermining his GF's autonomy. She might feel disrespected that he's not trusting her judgment in choosing her friends. \n\nThe key point here is that trust should be mutual. If he doesn't trust her friends, maybe he should talk to her about his concerns instead of secretly vetting them. Secrecy in such matters can lead to jealousy and control issues. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she has a right to her own social circle. Being labeled as controlling or sexist is a strong response, but it's not without reason if he's acting without her consent. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, are crossing boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong for invading his GF's privacy and not trusting her, which is controlling behavior.\n"
