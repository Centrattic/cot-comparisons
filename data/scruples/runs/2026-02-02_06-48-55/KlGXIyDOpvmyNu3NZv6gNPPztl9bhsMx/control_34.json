Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. So, the author's main concern is about not trusting those friends and wanting to check their intentions. They mention that they're not threatening, just taking notes, and they're okay with her having female friends as long as those friends don't go into relationship details.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is 8 months old, which is a significant period. Trust is a crucial element in any relationship. The author's actions involve investigating their GF's male friends, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The key here is whether those actions were justified or if they overstepped into controlling behavior.\n\nThe GF reacted negatively, calling the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid. That's a strong reaction. The term \"sexist\" might imply that the author is making assumptions about all male friends based on stereotypes. \"Controlling\" suggests that the author is imposing their will without consent. \"Paranoid\" indicates that the author's concerns are exaggerated or unfounded.\n\nThe author's defense is that they just want to ensure those friends are good guys and not trying to hit on her or cause issues. But, the problem arises in how they're doing this. If the author is secretly checking out her friends without her knowledge or consent, that's a privacy invasion. Even if done in a non-threatening way, the act of vetting without transparency can erode trust. In a healthy relationship, open communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting, discussing the concerns with Jenna would be more appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author might be projecting their own insecurities. Feeling the need to check up on her friends could indicate underlying trust issues, which might not be healthy. The GF's right to have friends and her autonomy in the relationship should be respected. If she's comfortable with those friends and they're not violating any agreed boundaries, the author's actions might be overbearing.\n\nHowever, some people might find it normal to be cautious about their partner's opposite-sex friends. But the line between caution and control is thin. The fact that the author didn't inform Jenna about their actions and instead made her figure it out herself is problematic. It's the secrecy and lack of communication that likely led to the argument. The GF's need for space shows the impact of the author's behavior on the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, are invasive and controlling. They should have addressed their concerns through open dialogue rather than behind the scenes. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
