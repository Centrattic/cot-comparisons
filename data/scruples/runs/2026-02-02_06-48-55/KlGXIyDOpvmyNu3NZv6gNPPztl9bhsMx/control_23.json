Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for \"vetting\" their girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out her guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues, but his girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are that the author is vetting her male friends without her knowledge, possibly through checking them out or monitoring their interactions. The girlfriend found out and is upset. The author's reasoning is lack of trust and wanting to prevent potential problems. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, trust is fundamental. If the author doesn't trust his girlfriend's male friends, that could indicate underlying issues in the relationship. Vetting someone else's friends without their knowledge can be seen as an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. It might also be controlling behavior because he's trying to manage who she interacts with, even if his intentions are to protect the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling that your partner is spying on your friends or making assumptions about their intentions can lead to feelings of being controlled or disrespected. The term \"controlling\" is often used when a partner tries to exert undue influence over the other's social life, which this situation might reflect. \n\nThe author argues he's not threatening, just taking notes. However, even passive monitoring without consent can be problematic. It's important to consider consent in relationships. Both partners should have open discussions about their boundaries and comfort levels. The fact that the author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend before proceeding suggests a lack of communication, which is a red flag.\n\nMoreover, the author's lack of trust in the male friends might stem from his own insecurities or jealousy rather than any actual wrongdoing by the friends. Assuming negative intentions without evidence can be a form of paranoia, which the girlfriend mentioned. It's possible the author is projecting his fears onto her friends, which isn't healthy for the relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some level of concern in a relationship is normal, the method here crosses a line. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and respect. If the author can't trust his girlfriend's friends, it might indicate deeper issues that need addressing, like insecurity or past experiences affecting his current relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's need for space after the argument shows that the situation has caused significant distress. Even though they are back to calm, the underlying tension might remain. The author should reflect on whether his actions are fostering a healthy environment or creating a controlling atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect the relationship, his methods are invasive and controlling. The lack of communication and the breach of trust are significant issues. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
