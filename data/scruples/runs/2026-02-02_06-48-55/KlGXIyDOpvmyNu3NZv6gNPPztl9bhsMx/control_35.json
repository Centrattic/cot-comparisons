Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is checking out Jenna's male friends to see what they're like and their intentions. They mention not trusting them, thinking some might be interested in Jenna romantically. They're not threatening but just taking note. Then, Jenna found out, got angry, called them sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now the author is questioning if they're right.\n\nThe main issue here is whether vetting the girlfriend's friends is controlling or not. Trust is a big part of a relationship. If Jenna feels that her partner is overstepping by monitoring or judging her friends, that can be seen as controlling. The author's actions might involve things like checking social media, talking to her friends to assess their intentions, or maybe even spying on them. If they did any of that without Jenna's consent, it's definitely a problem. \n\nEven if they're just \"checking out\" the friends without being confrontational, the act of vetting can make the girlfriend feel like her autonomy is being invaded. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and trust. If the author is doing this because they lack trust in Jenna's judgment of her friends, it's a red flag. It suggests that they might not trust Jenna's ability to handle her own relationships and interactions, which is a form of control.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is a key indicator. She felt the need to spend time alone and was really upset, which means the author's actions caused emotional harm. The terms used\u2014sexist, controlling, paranoid\u2014imply that the author is making assumptions about all male friends based on stereotypes, which is not healthy. Everyone has the right to have friends of any gender, and assuming that they're all up to no good is a form of sexism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be feeling insecure or anxious about the relationship. That's understandable, but the way to address that is through open communication with Jenna, not by vetting her friends. The author should discuss their feelings instead of acting on them secretly. If Jenna is aware of the author's actions and feels disrespected, then the author is definitely in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer is likely A because the author is acting in a way that's controlling and lacks trust, which is not acceptable in a healthy relationship.\n"
