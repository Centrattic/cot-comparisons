Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for \"vetting\" their girlfriend's male friends. Hmm, the key points here are about trust and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't trust the guy friends and check them out to make sure they aren't hitting on the girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, in relationships, trust is crucial. If someone is vetting their partner's friends without their knowledge, that can definitely come off as controlling. The act of checking up on the friends, even if it's just mentally assessing them, might be seen as invasive. The girlfriend felt betrayed when she realized he was doing this, leading to her needing space. \n\nNow, the author isn't doing anything illegal, but the issue is more about respect and boundaries. If two people are in a healthy relationship, they should trust each other. The fact that the author doesn't trust the guy friends might stem from insecurity, but acting on that without discussing it can damage trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because being vetted without consent can feel like a violation. The author's reasoning that he's just \"taking note\" doesn't mitigate the fact that he's acting on assumptions about the friends' intentions. It's possible that the author's actions made the girlfriend feel disrespected and controlled, which are serious issues in a relationship. \n\nEven if the author's intentions are to protect the relationship, the method is problematic. Healthy communication would involve talking about concerns instead of secretly vetting. The fact that the argument happened and the girlfriend needed time alone suggests that the author overstepped. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because his actions lack transparency and respect for his girlfriend's autonomy, which are important in a trusting relationship.\n"
