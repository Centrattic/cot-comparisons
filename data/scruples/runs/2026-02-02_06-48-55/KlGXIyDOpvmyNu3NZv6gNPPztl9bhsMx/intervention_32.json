Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out her guy friends to ensure they're not interested in her romantically or trying to cause trouble. The girlfriend is upset, calling them sexist, controlling, and paranoid.\n\nSo first, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for 8 months. The author isn't threatening but is keeping track and maybe even investigating her male friends. The key issue here is trust and how one partner is handling it. In a healthy relationship, trust is fundamental. If the author isn't trusting their GF's male friends without any evidence, that could be a problem. The GF might feel her autonomy is being invaded, as she has the right to be friends with others regardless of gender. \n\nThe author mentions they're okay with her having female friends as long as they don't talk too much about the relationship. That part already might be a bit controlling, but the main issue is with male friends. The act of vetting implies that the author is assessing these friends without their knowledge or consent, which can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intention is to protect the relationship, doing so without the GF's input or respecting her boundaries could be considered controlling behavior. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend felt the need to take time alone, which suggests that the argument was significant and hurtful. The labels the GF used\u2014sexist, controlling, paranoid\u2014are serious accusations. The author might not be acting on jealousy, but the method of checking up on her friends without clear cause could be seen as unjustified. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they're just being cautious. However, in a committed relationship, constant suspicion without evidence can erode trust. The author should perhaps talk to the GF about their feelings instead of taking it upon themselves to vet her friends. \n\nSo, based on these points, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because their actions are controlling and lack trust, even if their intentions are to protect the relationship.\n"
