Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out Jenna's guy friends to make sure they're not trying to hit on her or cause trouble. He's not threatening, just taking notes. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needs space. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. In a relationship, trust is crucial. The author's actions stem from a lack of trust in Jenna's male friends. But does that mistrust justify his actions? Vetting someone's friends without their knowledge could be seen as an invasion of privacy. It's one thing to discuss concerns openly, but another to secretly look into someone's social circle. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not okay with the guys discussing the relationship. That could imply he's uncomfortable with them knowing too much about their private life. However, Jenna's friends are her own people, and unless there's a specific reason to suspect infidelity or harm, his actions might come off as controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable. Feeling monitored can lead to feelings of being controlled, which can strain a relationship. The fact that Jenna asked for space shows she felt the need to address this boundary. The author's justification is based on distrust, but trust is typically a mutual effort. If he's not extending the same trust to his girlfriend's friends, it might indicate an imbalance in the relationship dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns aren't entirely unfounded. If there's a history of people trying to pursue Jenna, maybe there's some validity to his worries. However, the approach he took is problematic. Open communication would be a better strategy than covertly vetting her friends. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author's actions, while coming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, are likely controlling and breach trust. Jenna's reaction is valid because the method used is invasive. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
