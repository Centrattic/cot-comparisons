Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if it's acceptable for him to \"vet\" his girlfriend's male friends. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he doesn't trust Jenna's male friends because he thinks some of them might be interested in her. He checks out these guys to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. Now, the key points here are his actions: he's not threatening but taking notes. However, Jenna got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. She needed time alone, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nI need to consider boundaries in relationships. Trust is a big part of any partnership. If he's vetting her friends without her knowledge, that's an invasion of privacy. Even if his intentions are to protect, it's about how it's done. Trusting someone isn't the same as controlling their social interactions. Also, assuming that all her male friends have ulterior motives could be sexist, as it stereotypes men. Jenna's reaction is valid because he's overstepping by monitoring her friendships. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and communication. His actions might stem from insecurity, but that doesn't justify controlling behavior. So, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
