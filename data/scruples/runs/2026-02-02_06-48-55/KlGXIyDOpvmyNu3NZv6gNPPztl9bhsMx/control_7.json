Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author, let's call him Alex, is in an 8-month relationship with Jenna. He doesn't trust her male friends and checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or lead her to cheat. He's not threatening, just taking notes. But Jenna found out, got angry, called him sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needed some time alone. Now he's questioning if he's wrong.\n\nHmm. So the core issue is about trust and boundaries in the relationship. Let's think about typical relationship advice. Trust is crucial. If you're constantly vetting someone's friends, that might indicate a lack of trust, which can be a problem. Also, checking on her friends without her knowledge could be seen as invasive or controlling. Even if his intentions are to protect, the method might cross into overstepping boundaries.\n\nJenna's reaction suggests she felt disrespected. She might feel that he's not trusting her judgment or that he's being paranoid without cause. The term \"controlling\" is often used when one partner tries to manage the other's interactions without consent. Even if he's not threatening, the act of secretly vetting friends could be seen as a breach of trust and autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's natural to have concerns about the people close to one's partner. But the way he's handling it is problematic. Open communication is usually the healthier approach. Instead of spying, discussing his concerns with Jenna would be better. If she's trustworthy, she might understand, or if there's an issue, they could address it together. His actions have already caused conflict, which indicates that his approach isn't effective.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's singling out male friends but not mentioning female friends might contribute to the sexism she called him out for. It's a double standard if he's okay with her female friends but not male ones, unless there's a specific reason. But even then, the assumption that male friends are inherently a threat could be sexist.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely overstepping boundaries by vetting her friends without her knowledge, which is a breach of trust and can be seen as controlling. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
