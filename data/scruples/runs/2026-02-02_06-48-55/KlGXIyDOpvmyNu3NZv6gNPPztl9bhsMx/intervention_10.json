Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're an asshole for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. From what I read, they've been together 8 months and don't trust her guy friends. They check them out to ensure they're not hitting on her or causing issues.\n\nHmm, the key points here are trust and privacy. The author is monitoring their GF's friends without her knowledge. Even if they're not threatening, just \"taking note\" might still be invasive. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and snooping around can feel controlling. The GF got upset, calling the author sexist, controlling, and paranoid, which are serious accusations. \n\nThe author might think they're being protective, but it's important to respect boundaries. If they're worried about trust, communication would be better. Instead of secretly vetting friends, discussing their concerns with the GF would be healthier. The fact that the GF found out through others suggests the author didn't communicate their feelings, leading to a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, likely crossed into controlling behavior. Respecting partner's autonomy and privacy is essential. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
