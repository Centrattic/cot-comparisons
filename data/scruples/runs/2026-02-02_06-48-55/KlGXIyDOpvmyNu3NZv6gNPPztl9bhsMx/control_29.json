Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The main issue here is the author's actions of checking out her guy friends to ensure they don't hit on her or cause trouble.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She felt that his actions were controlling, sexist, and paranoid. Those are strong accusations. The author mentions that he's not threatening but just taking note of them. But from her side, being monitored or vetted without her knowledge might feel intrusive. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and if he's not trusting her friends, that could be a red flag for her. \n\nNext, the author's reasoning: he doesn't trust the friends because he thinks some might be interested in her romantically. However, it's her choice who her friends are. By vetting them, he's taking matters into his own hands, which can be seen as controlling. Healthy relationships require mutual trust and communication. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them with her instead of doing it secretly. \n\nAlso, the term \"sexist\" might come into play here because he's singling out her male friends for scrutiny, which could imply a double standard if he's not doing the same for his own female friends. The girlfriend might feel that he's assuming the worst about her friends without evidence, which is a form of paranoia and could be controlling behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he's just trying to protect the relationship. But protection shouldn't come at the cost of trust and open communication. The fact that she found out and was upset shows that his approach was not respectful of her autonomy and trust. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions likely crossed a boundary by not being transparent and by taking it upon himself to vet her friends, which can be seen as controlling. The right approach would have been to communicate his concerns directly with her and work together to address any issues. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
