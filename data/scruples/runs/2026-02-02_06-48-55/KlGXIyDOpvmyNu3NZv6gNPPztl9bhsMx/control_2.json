Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that the guy doesn't trust the guy friends, checks them out to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. His girlfriend is upset, calling him sexist, controlling, paranoid. The question is whether he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The guy is monitoring his girlfriend's friends, which is a form of surveillance. Even if he's not threatening, just observing and checking, it's a violation of her privacy. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect, and he's acting out of distrust without her consent.\n\nHe's also assuming that the male friends might have ulterior motives, which could be sexist if he's judging all men the same. His actions might be controlling because he's trying to manage her social interactions. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her privacy is invaded and her autonomy is being restricted.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal context. Some people might feel more protective, but that doesn't justify the actions. The key points are lack of trust without evidence, invasion of privacy, and potential control. The girlfriend has the right to her own friendships, and the author's actions undermine her agency.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
