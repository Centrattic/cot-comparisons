Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, let's call them \"Alex,\" has been in a relationship for 8 months with Jenna. Alex is concerned about Jenna's male friends, feeling that some of them might have romantic interests in her. They mention not being threatening but just \"taking note\" of them. The key point here is that Alex is monitoring Jenna's male friends to ensure they don't hit on her or lead her into cheating. \n\nJenna got upset, calling Alex sexist, controlling, and paranoid. She needed time alone but has since returned. The main question is whether Alex is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and if Alex doesn't trust Jenna's male friends, that could indicate deeper issues. However, the approach Alex is taking\u2014vetting friends\u2014might be seen as an overstep. Checking into someone's friends can come off as controlling, especially without discussing it with the partner. \n\nControl and jealousy are key factors here. While some level of concern is normal, actively vetting friends to ensure they're \"good guys\" implies a lack of trust in Jenna's judgment and decisions. This can be controlling behavior, as it's about maintaining power or influence over her social circle. \n\nAlso, the term \"sexist\" might apply here, as Alex is generalizing about male friends based on their gender, assuming they have ulterior motives. This stereotyping isn't fair and can be hurtful. \n\nCommunication is another aspect. If Alex had concerns, discussing them with Jenna instead of monitoring behind her back would be healthier. The fact that Jenna felt the need to spend time alone suggests that Alex's actions caused significant distress. \n\nOn the other hand, Alex might argue they're just trying to protect the relationship. However, healthy relationships involve mutual respect and trust. Constant monitoring can erode trust and lead to resentment. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Alex's actions are likely controlling and based on distrust. They didn't communicate their feelings with Jenna, leading to her feeling disrespected. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
