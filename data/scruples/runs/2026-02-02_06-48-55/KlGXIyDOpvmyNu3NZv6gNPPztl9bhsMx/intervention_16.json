Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. They've been together 8 months, and they don't trust the guy friends. They check them out to make sure they're not hitting on her or trying to get her to cheat. The GF got upset, called them sexist, controlling, paranoid.\n\nHmm. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The question is whether the author (AITA) is wrong. The user already thinks they are, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. If you don't trust your partner's friends, that's a red flag. But maybe the author's actions were overstepping. Checking out the friends could be seen as intrusive. How are they checking them out? If they're just being observant, maybe that's okay, but if they're actively investigating or judging, that's where it gets problematic.\n\nThe girl's reaction is valid. Feeling accused without cause can be hurtful. The author might be projecting their own insecurities onto the friends. Also, controlling behavior is when someone limits the other's autonomy. If the author is making decisions for Jenna based on their distrust, that's controlling.\n\nThe key points: lack of trust, invasion of privacy, controlling behavior. Even if the author's intentions are to protect, the method might not be appropriate. The GF has the right to have friends of any gender without being monitored. The author's actions could erode trust in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
