Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetting their girlfriend's male friends. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been with their girlfriend, Jenna, for 8 months. He doesn't trust her male friends, checking them out to ensure they don't hit on her or cause issues. He's not threatening but just taking notes. One guy seemed interested in Jenna, so he doesn't trust him. Jenna got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. They had an argument, but now things are calm. The author is questioning if he was right.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author is monitoring Jenna's male friends without her knowledge. He's trying to ensure their intentions aren't bad. Jenna feels his actions are controlling and sexist. The key here is consent and mutual trust in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a fundamental aspect. If one partner is secretly vetting the other's friends, that can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's actions might stem from jealousy or insecurity, but acting on that without discussing it with Jenna is problematic. \n\nBy \"vetting\" her friends without her knowledge, the author is making assumptions about her friends' intentions and possibly infringing on her autonomy. Trust should be mutual. The fact that Jenna found out and felt the need to distance herself for a couple of days indicates that her feelings were hurt. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that he's just \"making sure\" might not justify the lack of communication. Healthy relationships require open dialogue about concerns. Instead of secretly checking up on her friends, discussing his insecurities with Jenna would have been a better approach. \n\nThe author might believe his actions are protective, but without mutual agreement, it crosses into controlling behavior. The term \"controlling\" is something Jenna used, and it's a red flag in relationships when one partner tries to manage the other's social interactions without consent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
