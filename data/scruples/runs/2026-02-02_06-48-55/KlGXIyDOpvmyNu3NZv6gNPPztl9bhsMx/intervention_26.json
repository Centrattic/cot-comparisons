Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause issues. The girlfriend got upset, called him controlling and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what's considered appropriate in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any healthy relationship. If someone is constantly vetting their partner's friends without their knowledge, that could be seen as invading privacy. The author isn't just being curious; he's actively monitoring and judging her friends, possibly without their consent. That sounds controlling. \n\nEven if he has good intentions, the method he uses might be problematic. Checking out her friends without her knowledge could breach trust. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. Instead of secretly vetting, he should talk to Jenna about his concerns. If he's not trusting her friends, maybe there's an issue of trust in the relationship itself. \n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's reaction, she felt that his actions were sexist. Maybe he's making assumptions about all male friends having bad intentions, which could be a form of stereotyping. It's possible that his actions are based on insecurity rather than any real evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that he's just trying to protect her. But the way he's doing it is without her consent and could be harmful. The fact that she needed time alone shows that his actions hurt her. \n\nSo overall, the author's actions are likely controlling and a breach of trust, even if his intentions are to protect. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
