Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author \"vetting\" their girlfriend's male friends. The main points here are trust, control, and communication.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't trust the guy friends and check them out to make sure they're not hitting on the girlfriend or leading her to cheat. They say they're not threatening, just taking notes. The girlfriend is upset, calling them sexist, controlling, paranoid, and needing space. \n\nNow, I need to analyze whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. If one partner is constantly vetting the other's friends without discussing it, that could be seen as controlling or lacking trust. The author isn't discussing their concerns with the girlfriend but instead acting on their own to \"vet\" people. That might be intrusive and could be perceived as possessive or jealous, which can be toxic in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her autonomy is being invaded. The author's actions might not be physically controlling, but emotionally, they could be undermining the trust and freedom expected in a healthy relationship. The fact that she needed a day or two alone suggests that the author's behavior was hurtful. \n\nHowever, the author's intention is to protect the relationship, which is understandable. Jealousy is a common emotion, but how it's handled matters. Instead of vetting friends secretly, a better approach might be to communicate the concerns and work together. \n\nIn many cases, when one partner acts on their jealousy without discussion, it's considered controlling. The author isn't allowing the girlfriend to manage her own friendships, which is her right unless there are specific boundaries agreed upon. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions likely cross the line into controlling behavior, even if their intentions are to protect the relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
