Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. So, the author, let's call him Alex, has been checking out Jenna's guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause trouble. He's not threatening, just observing. The problem is that Jenna found out and got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. Now they're back together but there's lingering tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From Alex's perspective, he's concerned about the relationship and wants to protect Jenna. He might feel insecure or worried that these friends have ulterior motives. But from Jenna's side, she probably sees his actions as an invasion of privacy and a lack of trust. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and if she feels he doesn't trust her judgment with her friends, that's a problem.\n\nVetting friends is a common issue in relationships. Where do you draw the line between being protective and being controlling? If Alex is just observing without confronting Jenna or her friends, maybe he's being cautious. But the key point is that Jenna doesn't like it and feels her autonomy is being respected. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel they can have independent social circles. If Alex is monitoring her interactions without her knowledge, that's a breach of trust and could be seen as controlling.\n\nAlso, the term \"controlling\" comes up. Even if Alex's intentions are good, the method of secretly vetting friends without her consent might cross into controlling behavior. It's about communication. If he had concerns, he should have discussed them with Jenna instead of acting unilaterally. The fact that she asked for time alone shows the impact his actions had on her. \n\nAnother angle is that the situation led to an argument and temporary separation. While they're back together, the underlying issue hasn't been resolved. If this behavior continues, it could cause more problems. Trust and respect are foundational, and if Alex isn't respecting her friendships, that's a red flag. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often advise that trust should be inherent in a relationship. If you feel the need to vet someone else's friends, it might indicate deeper insecurities that should be addressed through communication and therapy rather than surveillance. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Alex's actions, while coming from a place of wanting to protect the relationship, are likely seen as controlling and disrespectful. Jenna's reaction is valid because she has the right to her own friendships without her partner's approval. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
