Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The author is checking out her guy friends to make sure they don't hit on her or cause problems. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The relationship is eight months old, which isn't super long. The guy doesn't trust the guy friends, which could stem from insecurity or past experiences. He's not threatening but taking mental notes. He mentions one guy who seems interested in her romantically and he's worried about that.\n\nThe girlfriend got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and paranoid. She needed time alone. Now he's questioning if he was wrong. \n\nSo, what's the issue here? Trust is a big part of relationships. If he's not communicating his concerns to her instead of just vetting them behind her back, that could be a problem. Also, checking out her friends without her knowledge might be seen as invasive. Jealousy is normal, but acting on it without discussion can lead to control issues.\n\nIs it okay to want to protect his partner? Maybe, but the method matters. If he's doing this without her input, it might come off as controlling. The girlfriend's reaction shows she feels disrespected. Trust in a relationship should be mutual. If he doesn't trust her friends, maybe he should talk to her about it instead of doing his own investigation. \n\nAlso, the fact that she felt the need to distance herself from the guy friends because of his actions might be an issue. If her friends start to talk about him negatively because of his vetting, it could create tension. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions might be seen as controlling and lacking trust. The girlfriend has a right to have her own friends without feeling monitored. The author should address his insecurities through communication rather than behind-the-scenes checks. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
