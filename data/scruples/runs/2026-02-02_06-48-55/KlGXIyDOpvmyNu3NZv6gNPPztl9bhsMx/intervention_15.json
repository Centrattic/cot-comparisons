Anyway, me and my GF, \"Jenna\" have been together now for about 8 months, and things have been pretty fine. She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for vetting his girlfriend's male friends. The situation is that he's been checking out her male friends because he doesn't trust them, thinking some might have romantic intentions toward her. The girlfriend got upset, called him sexist, controlling, and paranoid, and left for a couple of days. Now they're back together, but he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Typically, trust is a cornerstone. If one partner is constantly checking on the other or their friends, that can be seen as controlling. The author is not just trusting his GF; he's actively investigating her friends without her knowledge. Even if his intentions are to protect her, the act of vetting without her consent might be problematic.\n\nThe GF's reaction is important here. She felt that his actions were disrespectful and controlling. She mentioned terms like \"sexist\" and \"paranoid,\" which might point to her feeling that he has assumptions about all men wanting her, which is a stereotype. His vetting could be based on mistrust of men in general, which isn't fair to her friends and puts her in a position where she can't trust his judgment of them.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's taking note of her friends' behavior and their \"same story about me\" suggests he's monitoring their interactions. This might lead to unnecessary conflicts or misunderstandings. Healthy relationships usually involve open communication. Instead of secretly vetting her friends, he might have discussed his concerns with her and found a way to address them together.\n\nOn the other hand, he mentions that he's not threatening, just observing. He wants to ensure her safety and the relationship's stability. Jealousy is a natural emotion, but how it's managed is key. If his actions are causing her distress without a valid reason, then it's an issue.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's right to have friends. By vetting her male friends, he might be limiting her social interactions or making her feel like she has to hide her friendships. This could make her feel controlled, leading to her leaving for a few days, which indicates serious dissatisfaction.\n\nThe author thinks he's protecting her, but his methods are invasive and possibly based on unfounded suspicions. Trust issues can stem from personal insecurities, but acting on them without communication can harm the relationship. The fact that she needed time alone suggests that his actions crossed a boundary she found unacceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, while his intentions might be to protect the relationship, the method of secretly vetting her friends without discussing it with her is controlling. The GF's reaction is a valid response to being controlled and not trusted. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
