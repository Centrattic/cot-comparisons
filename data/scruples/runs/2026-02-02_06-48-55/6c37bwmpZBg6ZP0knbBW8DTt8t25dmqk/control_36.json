I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a gift for her husband and a confrontation with the cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which was expensive. She posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift isn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and there was a back-and-forth. The girl called her a bitch, and now the author is wondering if she was right to respond.\n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's reaction. Let's break it down. The author's gift was a significant purchase, costing her a whole paycheck. She took pride in getting her husband something he wanted. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend seemed dismissive and possibly envious, especially since the girl's family had asked for money for a baby but could afford the same gift. \n\nThe author's response led to a conflict. Now, the question is whether her reaction was justified. On one hand, the comment was personal and possibly mean-spirited. The author might feel that defending her effort and the significance of the gift is valid. On the other hand, responding in a confrontational way could escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nBut considering the context, the author's reaction might be seen as a defense of her effort and pride in the gift. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could be interpreted as trying to belittle the author's gesture. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, might stem from feeling attacked over something personal. Additionally, the mention of financial sacrifice adds another layer of justification for her defensiveness.\n\nHowever, attacking someone else's parenting skills (as the girl's comment might have done by mentioning the baby) could be a sensitive area. But the main issue here was about the gift. The author might have overreacted by bringing up parenting, but the initial comment was about the gift. The conflict could have been avoided if the author didn't take the comment personally or if the cousin's girlfriend didn't make the comment in the first place.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often get defensive about their celebrations and gifts, especially when they feel their efforts are being undermined. The author's financial situation adds weight to her frustration. The cousin's family's financial situation (needing money for diapers but buying a $400 gift) might have also contributed to her anger, as it could seem hypocritical.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author's response was in the wrong. Since the cousin's girlfriend made a derogatory comment that could be seen as trying to diminish the author's effort, responding in defense might be understandable. However, calling out parenting skills could be an overreach. But without more details on what exactly was said about parenting, it's hard to judge. The author might have felt that the comment about the gift was a backhanded way to criticize her parenting (since they have no children), but that's speculative.\n\nOverall, it's a nuanced situation. The woman who commented might be in the wrong for making a hurtful comment, and the author's response, while perhaps harsh, could be seen as a justified reaction to being attacked. However, the author could have handled it differently. But based on the information given, the author might not be in the wrong because she was defending her effort and pride in the gift against a dismissive comment.\n"
