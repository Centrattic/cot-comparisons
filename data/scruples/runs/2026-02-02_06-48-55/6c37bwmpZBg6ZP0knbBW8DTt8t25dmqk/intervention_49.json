I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for defending their gift by calling out the cousin's girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author bought a gift for her husband, which she was proud of because it was a big expense. She posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she had given the same gift to her partner (the cousin) on Christmas, implying that the author's gift wasn't special. The author then called the girl out, and there was an argument.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to respond the way she did. Let me consider both sides. \n\nThe author felt disrespected because someone else had given the same gift earlier, making her feel her effort wasn't recognized. She also mentions the financial aspect\u2014spending her entire paycheck. Plus, the cousin's family had recently asked for money for baby supplies, which might have added to her frustration. Her reaction was to confront the girl, leading to a conflict where the other person called her a bitch, and now the author is defending her actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend might have been trying to make a point, but her comment could have been perceived as dismissive. However, the author's response escalated the situation. Publicly calling someone a bitch is pretty harsh. Even if the author felt wronged, responding in anger might not have been the best approach. The situation might have been better handled with a private, calm conversation instead of a public confrontation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the other person is 20 and the cousin is 26. Maybe the girl was trying to compare the gifts in a way that wasn't constructive, but the author's response was aggressive. The author's justification about her financial sacrifice is valid, but reacting in a way that attacks the other person's parenting skills (as mentioned when the girl is now mad at her for calling out parenting skills) complicates things further. Maybe the author overstepped by bringing up the other person's parenting, which might not be relevant to the initial comment.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised to avoid public shaming or confrontations over such issues. The author's pride in her gift is understandable, but her response was defensive and confrontational. So, while the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was rude, the author's reaction was also inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation with an aggressive response rather than addressing it calmly.\n"
