I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and the other person called her a bitch. Now the author is questioning if she was right to respond that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both sides. The author spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which was something her husband wanted for years. She's proud of the gift and felt disrespected by the comment. The cousin's girlfriend might have thought she was being helpful or just trying to share that she did the same for her husband. But the comment came off as dismissive and possibly envious, given that the other couple had a baby and were asking for money for diapers and formula. That might add to the author's frustration because it seems contradictory for them to afford a $400 gift when they were asking for help with baby expenses.\n\nThe author's response was to call out the cousin's girlfriend, which led to the other person calling her a bitch. The author now feels justified because she was defending her gift and her pride in it. The other person might feel that the author overreacted, especially since the comment was a simple statement without malice. However, the author's reaction could be seen as defensive. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was proportionate. The comment was a bit passive-aggressive, so the author felt attacked. Confronting someone online can escalate things quickly. Maybe the author could have addressed it privately instead of publicly calling out the cousin's girlfriend, which might have been more appropriate. But then again, the author felt disrespected and wanted to defend her actions. \n\nThe cousin's girlfriend's comment about the gift not being special could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the financial sacrifice the author made. The author's anger is valid in that sense. However, responding by \"calling out her parenting skills\" (as the other person says) might be taking it too far. The author might have implied something about how the cousin's girlfriend spends money irresponsibly, which could be a personal attack. That's where the line might be crossed. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by attacking the other person's parenting. If the author's response included comments about how they can afford such gifts while needing help with diapers, that's a valid point, but framing it as a personal attack on parenting skills might be inappropriate. The author could have expressed her frustration without making it about the other person's parenting. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was probably inconsiderate and dismissive. The author's anger is understandable. However, the way she responded (calling out the other person's parenting) might be the issue. It's possible that the author's response was a defensive reaction, but it escalated the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because she escalated the situation by attacking the other person's parenting, which might not be relevant to the original issue. The initial comment was a problem, but the response crossed a line. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). However, there's also a case to be made that the other person's comment was rude, and the author's response was a justified defense of her pride. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, it's more about whether her actions were appropriate. The key point is that attacking parenting skills is a personal attack, which is not proportionate to the original comment. Hence, the author is in the wrong for taking it to that level.\n"
