I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a conflict over a birthday present. Here's the situation: the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted it on Facebook, and her husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author then responded angrily, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. The girl's comment was probably meant to belittle the gift, which the author felt was unfair given her financial sacrifice and the fact that the other family was asking for money for a baby but could afford a $400 gift. The author called out the girl, who then called her a bitch, and the girl is now upset about the parenting comment.\n\nFrom a social perspective, publicly calling someone out might be seen as overreacting, especially if the initial comment was a simple comparison. The author had a valid reason to feel hurt\u2014financial sacrifice and the other family's situation. However, responding in a confrontational way can escalate the conflict. The girl's comment was dismissive, but the author's response might have crossed a line by attacking the girl's parenting, especially since she's 20 and not a parent. The age and parenting comment could be a sensitive issue, perhaps unfairly targeting the girl.\n\nThe author's intent was to defend her gift and her pride in it, which is understandable. However, the method\u2014calling the girl out and bringing up parenting\u2014may have been inappropriate. The girl's comment was a personal jab, but the author's response might have been disproportionate. People often react defensively when they feel judged, but the way she responded might not have been the best approach. \n\nConsidering the context of their relationship, they might not be close, so the girl's comment could have been a harmless jab, while the author took it as a personal attack. The author's justification about financial sacrifice is valid, but others might view the girl's comment as just a comparison without malice. The author's follow-up, especially mentioning parenting, might have been a low blow since the girl is 20 and not a parent, which could have been unnecessary and contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while the girl's comment was rude, the author's response escalated the situation. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because attacking someone's parenting (even if it's a joke) is a sensitive topic and might not be the appropriate way to defend oneself. However, some might argue that the author had the right to stand up for herself, especially given the financial context and the girl's own family's situation. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The girl's initial comment was a personal attack, but the author's response went beyond just defending her gift to attacking the girl's personal choices, which could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's actions, while understandable, might be considered excessive. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
