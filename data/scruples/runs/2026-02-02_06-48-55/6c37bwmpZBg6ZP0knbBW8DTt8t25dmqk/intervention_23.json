I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift given to the husband for his birthday, and the girlfriend of his cousin made a comment about the same gift being given as a Christmas present. The author responded by calling her out, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author spent a significant portion of their income on a gift that her husband really wanted. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author got angry because they were asking for money for a baby two weeks prior, so the comment felt hypocritical. She called the girl out, and the girl got defensive, calling her a bitch and then being upset about the author's response.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. Let's break it down. The cousin's girlfriend made a comment that the gift wasn't special because someone else had given the same item. That's a common social behavior\u2014people sometimes compare gifts. But the author took it as an attack and responded by calling her out. Now, the question is, was that response appropriate?\n\nThe author's defense is that the gift was meaningful and expensive for her, and the cousin's family had financial issues. However, the cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was a direct critique of the gift's originality. The author might have felt that the comment was dismissive of her effort and financial sacrifice. However, responding by \"calling out her parenting skills\" (which seems like an accusation that she's a bad parent because she could afford a game system but needed money for baby supplies) is a bit of a stretch. The author is attacking the cousin's girlfriend's character rather than just addressing the comment.\n\nNow, in terms of social norms, when someone makes a comment like \"you're not special,\" it's often meant to be dismissive. The appropriate response might be to express how the comment made her feel or to ignore it. But escalating it by attacking the person's parenting, especially when they had recently asked for money, could be seen as crossing a line. The cousin's girlfriend might have felt it was her own purchase, and the author's accusation about her parenting could be perceived as accusatory and rude, regardless of whether the financial situation was true.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author has no children might make her less empathetic towards parenting challenges. The cousin's girlfriend is 20, so it's possible she's a young parent dealing with the costs of a baby, and the game system might have been a splurge. The author's assumption that they can't afford it because they asked for money for diapers and formula is an assumption. Maybe they had other sources of income or financial support. The author's response might be based on incomplete information.\n\nSo, while the cousin's girlfriend's comment was perhaps inconsiderate or mean, the author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily. Instead of addressing the comment directly or not engaging, she chose to attack the person's parenting, which is a personal and sensitive issue. That's likely where she went wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
