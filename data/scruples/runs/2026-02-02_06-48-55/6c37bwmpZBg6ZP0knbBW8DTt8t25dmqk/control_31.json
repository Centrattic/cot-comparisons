I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift for her husband being criticized by his cousin's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for her partner on Christmas, implying the author's gift isn't special. The author was upset because the gift cost her an entire paycheck and she felt proud of it. Also, the couple who had the baby were asking for money for diapers and formula but could afford the $400 gift. The author called the girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the girlfriend called her a bitch, but the author defends her actions.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and potentially envious. The author might have felt her effort and sacrifice were being undermined. However, responding by \"calling her out on parenting skills\" might have escalated the situation. The author's actions could be seen as defensive. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? The initial comment was rude, so the author had a reason to be upset. However, how she responded might have been inappropriate. The girlfriend was in the wrong for the dismissive comment, but the author's retaliation could be seen as overstepping, especially if it involved personal attacks. The key is whether her response was proportional. If she attacked her parenting skills in return, that's not fair, even if the other person was rude first. So maybe the author is in the wrong for the way she responded, even if the initial comment was wrong. But there's also the aspect of defending her own feelings and effort. It's a bit of a grey area, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she responded with an attack on parenting, which is personal, then yes, she might be wrong. However, if she just defended her gift choice without attacking her, that's different. The user says she called her out on parenting skills, implying a personal attack. So that's probably where the mistake is. Hence, answer A (Yes, she is in the wrong) because of the personal attack in her response.\n"
