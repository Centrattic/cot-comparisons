I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is that she bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted it on Facebook, and her husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she already bought the same thing for her (the cousin's) boyfriend. The author called her a bitch in response, and now the other girl is mad because she felt her parenting skills were criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was defensive because she spent a lot of money on her husband's birthday gift. The other person's comment made her feel like her gift wasn't special. She responded by calling her a bitch, and there's an argument about parenting skills. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author might feel that the comment was unnecessary and that her effort and sacrifice in buying the gift shouldn't be dismissed. The other person's comment could be seen as dismissive and possibly envious, but maybe she was just trying to compare the gifts. On the other hand, the author's response was to call her a bitch, which is aggressive and confrontational. That could escalate the situation. \n\nAlso, the other girl's comment might have been insensitive, especially considering the author's financial situation. But the author's reaction of calling her a bitch is not a constructive response. Even if someone makes a hurtful comment, responding with aggression might not be the best approach. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the other couple had a baby recently and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet they bought a $400 game. The author might be implying hypocrisy, but that's not directly relevant to the situation. The author's response targeted the other person's parenting, which could be an overreach. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone publicizes a gift, especially on social media, there's a risk of others comparing or commenting. The author might have overreacted by using an insult. The other person might not have intended to belittle the effort, but the comment could still be hurtful. However, the author's reaction of attacking the other person's character (calling her a bitch) is likely the wrong approach. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were the wrong way to handle the situation. Even if the comment was hurtful, responding with an insult is not appropriate. The correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
