He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the Facebook post is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift she bought her husband for his birthday, and another person (the cousin's girlfriend) commented that she bought the same gift for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the first person's gift wasn't special.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which she mentions cost her her entire check of $500 every two weeks. She was proud of the gift because he wanted it for years. Then the cousin's girlfriend comments that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, making the author feel her gift isn't special. The author responds by calling the girlfriend out, which led to the girl calling her a bitch and now the author is questioned if she was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about entitlement to feel proud of one's gift and the response to the comment. The author might feel that the other person's comment was dismissive of her effort and financial sacrifice. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as trying to undermine the significance of the gift, maybe out of jealousy or insecurity. But is the author in the wrong for responding?\n\nThe author's response was to \"call her out,\" which the girl then took as an attack on her parenting skills. The author might have overreacted, but she had a right to defend her feelings. The girlfriend's initial comment was the trigger. The author's pride in her gift is valid, especially given her financial situation and the effort she put in. However, responding with an attack on the other person's parenting might escalate the situation unnecessarily. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering social norms, when someone feels disrespected, they might feel justified in responding. However, the way she responded (attacking the girlfriend's parenting) might be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial comment was hurtful. The girlfriend's comment was about the gift, but the author's response shifted to the girlfriend's parenting, which could be a personal attack. \n\nBut the author's justification is that the girlfriend's comment was invalidating her effort and financial sacrifice. The author might not be in the wrong for defending herself, but the method of defense involved attacking the other person's parenting, which might not be appropriate. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, and the answer depends on whether the response was proportionate. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author overreacted by bringing up parenting when the initial issue was about the gift. On the other hand, if the author felt that the girlfriend was being dismissive and perhaps even hypocritical (as they had asked for money for their baby recently), the author's response could be seen as defending her own value. \n\nSo, the answer might be a bit nuanced. But according to the options, we have to choose A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). Considering that the author responded in a way that escalated the conflict by attacking personal aspects (parenting), even if the initial comment was hurtful, the author might be in the wrong. However, others might say she had a right to defend her feelings. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B (No) because the initial comment was the trigger, and the author's reaction was a defensive response, even if it escalated. But the \"calling out parenting skills\" part is problematic. So maybe A (Yes) is more accurate. Hmm. Need to decide based on typical AITA analysis. Often, if someone reacts with personal attacks, they're considered in the wrong. So the author attacked the girlfriend's parenting, which is a personal attack beyond the original issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
