I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves her husband's birthday gift and a comment from his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the woman bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which was a significant expense for her. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend responded by saying she bought the same for her cousin (the husband's cousin) at Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to an argument where the other woman called her a bitch and now is upset about being called out on her parenting skills.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's reaction to the comment, whether she was justified in calling the other person out, and if her response was appropriate.\n\nLet me break it down. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was clearly rude and condescending. She's implying that the author's gift wasn't special because she did it first. That's a classic case of someone trying to belittle another person's gesture. The author was defensive because the gift was a big deal for her\u2014she mentions the financial cost and her pride in giving it. \n\nBut when the author responded by attacking the other person's parenting skills, that might have escalated things unnecessarily. The cousin's girlfriend had a baby recently and was asking for money, so the author used that as a point to criticize her. That could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the initial comment was rude, responding by attacking her parenting might not be fair or appropriate. \n\nThe question is about whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the initial comment was unkind. On the other, retaliating by bringing up her parenting could be seen as the author overreacting. \n\nAlso, the cousin's girlfriend's statement about the gift being bought earlier doesn't negate the author's gesture. Gifts for different people at different times don't compare. The author has the right to be proud of her gift regardless of others. \n\nBut in terms of handling the situation, the author could have called out the rude comment without attacking the other person's parenting. By doing so, she might have escalated the conflict. The cousin's girlfriend's parenting isn't relevant to the original issue unless there's a direct link, which there isn't. \n\nSo, while the cousin's girlfriend was in the wrong first, the author's response might have made her partly at fault by bringing up unrelated issues. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how she handled the situation, even though the initial comment was rude.\n"
