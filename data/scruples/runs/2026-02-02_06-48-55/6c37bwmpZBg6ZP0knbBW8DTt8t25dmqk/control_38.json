I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented, saying she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas and implying the author isn't special. The author then called her out, got called a bitch, and now the girl is mad about the author's comment on her parenting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author spent her entire paycheck on this gift, which was a big deal for her. The cousin's family had a baby recently and asked for money for diapers and formula, but they managed to buy a $400 game system. That might have been a point the author brought up, which could have been seen as attacking her parenting or financial decisions.\n\nThe author's reaction was to call the girl out, which led to a conflict. The main question is whether the author was justified in her response. \n\nOn one hand, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was probably meant to belittle the author's gift, making her feel her gesture wasn't special. The author's pride and financial sacrifice could be valid reasons for feeling upset. However, how she responded might have been the issue. If she attacked the girl's parenting or made it personal, that could escalate the situation. The girl then took offense, which the author might not have intended.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The initial comment was a passive-aggressive jab, so the author's reaction of calling her out might have been a direct response. But since the girl's comment was about the gift, the author's response attacking her parenting could cross a line. The author's reasoning about the cousin's family's financial situation (needing diapers but buying a game system) might have been a point of contention, but bringing up parenting skills could be seen as an ad hominem attack, especially since the girl is a parent.\n\nSo, the author's intent might have been to defend her gift and her effort, but her method of doing so by attacking the other person's parenting is problematic. It's possible that a more measured response, like explaining her perspective without attacking, would have been better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict by attacking the girl's parenting instead of addressing the initial comment directly.\n"
