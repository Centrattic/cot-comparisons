I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, posted about it on Facebook. Her husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, claiming the author isn't special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to an argument. The key points to consider are the reasons the author was upset: 1) the gift cost her her entire paycheck, and 2) the other couple had a baby and were asking for money for diapers but could afford the $400 console.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction is understandable. She spent a significant amount on a gift her husband wanted for years. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend might have come across as dismissive or envious. However, reacting by \"attacking\" the other person could be seen as escalating the situation. The author's defense includes the financial aspect and the other family's financial situation, but that's more about justifying her feelings rather than the action of calling out the comment.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. While she had a reason to be upset, responding in a confrontational way led to conflict. The other person's comment might have been inappropriate, but the author's response might have been overly harsh. The fact that the other person called her a bitch first might not give her the right to escalate it further. Also, the author's defense about the other family's financial situation could be seen as an ad hominem attack, which isn't helpful. \n\nSo, while the original comment was rude, the author's response of attacking the other person's parenting skills (since she mentions the baby) might have crossed a line. It's possible the author overreacted, especially considering the other person was 20 and the author was 24. The situation is a bit nuanced, but the key is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the initial comment was about the gift, and the author's response targeted the other person's personal life, it might be considered in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
