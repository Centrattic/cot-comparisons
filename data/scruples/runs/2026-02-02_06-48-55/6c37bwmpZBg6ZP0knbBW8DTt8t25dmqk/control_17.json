I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift for her husband and a confrontation with the cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch, and the author defended herself, possibly attacking the other's parenting skills because they had a baby recently and were asking for money for diapers.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author felt disrespected by the comment. The other person's comment was dismissive and possibly envious. The author's reaction was to confront her, which escalated the situation. The key points are the initial comment, the author's response, and whether the response was justified.\n\nThe other person didn't have a right to belittle the author's gift, especially considering the author's financial sacrifice. However, the author's response of calling out her parenting skills might be crossing a line. The other person's financial situation isn't clear, but the author's response might be seen as attacking her for not being able to afford the same gift when they were asking for money for their baby. The author's defense about not having children might also play into the situation, but that's her personal choice.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the initial comment was hurtful and unkind. The author had the right to express her frustration, but responding by attacking the other person's parenting could be seen as an overreaction. It's possible the author is in the wrong for escalating the conflict in a personal way. Alternatively, the other person's comment was the real issue, and the author's response, while perhaps harsh, was a reaction to being disrespected.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's financial sacrifice and the other person's dismissive comment, the author's anger is understandable. However, retaliating by attacking parenting skills might not be the best approach. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the author had the right to feel wronged and defend her gift, but the method of response was inappropriate. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because attacking parenting skills could be seen as an unfair personal attack, even if the initial comment was wrong. Alternatively, if the author's response was proportionate, then B. But since she attacked parenting skills, which is a personal jab, maybe she's in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
