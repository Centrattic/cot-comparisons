I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for lashing out at the cousin's girlfriend. The situation involves a Facebook post about a birthday gift for the husband, and the cousin's girlfriend comments that she already bought the same gift for her partner on Christmas. The author responds by calling her out, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author worked for the money and spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which was important to her husband. The cousin's girlfriend, who recently had a baby, mentioned that she bought the same gift for her partner. The author points out the irony that they were asking for money for baby expenses but had enough for a $400 item. The author then defends herself when the girlfriend calls her a bitch, and the situation escalates.\n\nNow, the key points to evaluate are: Did the author overreact? Was the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend meant to belittle the author's gift? The cousin's girlfriend's comment might have been dismissive, but was it intended to attack the author? The author's defense included a jab at the cousin's parenting, which could be inappropriate. Also, the author's response might have been public, which could escalate the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess if the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, the author had a personal right to be proud of her gift. On the other, attacking the cousin's girlfriend's parenting skills isn't constructive. The author's response might have been more hurtful than the original comment. Also, the public nature of Facebook could have made the situation worse. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might not have been as malicious as the author interpreted it. The author's pride was hurt, but lashing out in a public forum and bringing up the cousin's financial situation (which might be sensitive) could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's reaction might be excessive. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could have been a harmless or even well-meaning observation, but the author took it as an insult. The author's response involved personal attacks, which is problematic. Therefore, the author is more at fault here.\n"
