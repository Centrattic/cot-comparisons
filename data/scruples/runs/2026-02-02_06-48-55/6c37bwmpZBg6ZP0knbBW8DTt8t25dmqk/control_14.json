I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting someone who commented on their gift for their husband. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday, which she mentions cost her her entire paycheck. She posted pictures of the gift on Facebook, and her husband's cousin's girlfriend (who's 20) responded by saying she bought the same for her partner at Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch, and now the other person is upset with the author for criticizing her parenting skills (since they had a baby recently but could afford the gift).\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author was proud of her gift and felt it was significant, given her financial situation.\n2. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend made her feel disrespected, especially considering the other family's recent financial requests (asking for money for diapers and formula), which contrasts with their ability to spend on a $400 gift.\n3. The author responded by calling her out, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social interaction perspective, when someone makes a hurtful comment, it's natural to feel defensive. However, how one responds is crucial. The author was upset that someone else's gift was compared to hers, implying hers wasn't special. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive or attempting to undermine the author's effort. The author's response might have been a defense of her own feelings, but attacking the other person's parenting skills (especially in a public forum like Facebook) might not be the best approach.\n\nThe cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was probably a passive-aggressive way to compare, but the author's retaliation by bringing up parenting could escalate the situation. Even if the author feels justified, responding in a way that criticizes someone's parenting is sensitive, especially since the other person is young and has a child. This could be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial comment was unwarranted.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to defend her gift's significance and maybe point out the hypocrisy of the other family's financial situation. But attacking parenting skills might not be proportionate to the original comment. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but her response could be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's reaction escalated the conflict by attacking the other person's personal life (parenting), which might not be fair. The original comment was rude, but the response could be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how she responded, even if her feelings were hurt first.\n"
