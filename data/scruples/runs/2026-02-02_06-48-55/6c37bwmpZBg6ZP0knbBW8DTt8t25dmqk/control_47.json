I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift for the husband and a conflict with his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the woman bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for her partner on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author then got angry and called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch, and she felt justified.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong in defending her gift. Let me break down the points.\n\nThe author spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which was a big deal for her. She was proud of it because her husband wanted it for years. The other person, who recently had a baby and was asking for money for diapers and formula, had the means to buy a $400 game system. The author took the comment personally, feeling undermined, and responded by calling her out. The other person then took offense, especially regarding the author's comment about parenting skills.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, defending your pride in a gift you worked hard for seems reasonable. However, the way she responded might have escalated the situation. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend was likely meant to belittle the author's effort, maybe out of jealousy or a need to one-up. The author's reaction was to confront her, which led to a back-and-forth. \n\nBut here's the thing: the cousin's girlfriend's comment was inconsiderate and possibly envious. The author had every right to feel disrespected. However, the way she called out the other person's parenting skills (since they had a baby) might have crossed a line. That part could be seen as attacking personal choices or finances, which is more sensitive. \n\nThe key factors here are the intent and the proportionality of the response. The author was defending her pride in a gift that was meaningful and a significant financial commitment. The other person's comment was dismissive. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, might be justified in her defense. However, bringing up parenting could have been a personal jab that wasn't directly related to the initial comment, which could be seen as the author overstepping. \n\nBut considering the context, if the author felt that the other person's comment was mocking her financial sacrifice and the effort put into the gift, calling her out on that might be a reasonable reaction. The other person's response of calling her a bitch indicates that the tone escalated, but the root issue was the initial comment. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the specifics of her response. If she directly attacked the cousin's girlfriend's parenting without provocation, that could be the issue. But if she was pointing out the hypocrisy of the other person's financial situation (they had money for a PS4 but asked for diapers and formula), that's a different matter. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for defending her gift's significance, especially if the comment was meant to undermine her. However, if her response was unnecessarily harsh and went beyond the initial comment, contributing to the conflict, that could be a problem. The line between defending oneself and being confrontational is thin here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as justified given the initial provocation, but the escalation through personal attacks could tip the balance. However, since the cousin's girlfriend started the conflict with a dismissive comment, the author's defense might be more in the right, unless her response was disproportionately harsh. Given the information, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. Since the user is asking for a yes or no answer, I need to decide based on the key points.\n"
