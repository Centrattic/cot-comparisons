I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday gift for her husband and a conflict with the cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which cost her entire paycheck. She posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for her cousin on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and she called out her parenting skills. Now the other person is mad.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was rude and dismissive. The author was defensive about her gift, which she paid for with her hard-earned money. She also points out the other person's family had financial issues but still bought an expensive gift. That's a valid point.\n\nBut when the author responded, she escalated the situation by attacking the other person's parenting. Even if the initial comment was rude, responding with an attack on parenting might be crossing a line. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is proportionality. The author's response was not just defending her gift but bringing up parenting, which is a personal and sensitive topic. Even if the other person was rude, attacking someone's parenting is a serious accusation and could be seen as the wrong approach.\n\nAlso, the author mentions having no children, which might not directly affect the situation but adds context. The cousin's girlfriend is 20, which is young, and maybe not having kids is normal for her age. But the author's attack on parenting skills is still problematic.\n\nSo, the initial comment was rude, but the author's response was more aggressive and personal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the argument beyond the original issue. The correct answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because she crossed a line by bringing up parenting skills, which is a more personal and harsh response than necessary.\n"
