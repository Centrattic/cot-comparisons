I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author defending their birthday gift for their husband after the cousin's girlfriend comments that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author spent their entire paycheck on a PS4 Pro and a game for their husband, who's been wanting it for years. The cousin's girlfriend, who's 20, commented that she bought the same for the cousin (who's 26) on Christmas, making the author feel belittled. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the girlfriend called the author a bitch and now is upset about the author's comments on her parenting (since they had a baby in November and were asking for money for diapers and formula but managed to buy the $400 game).\n\nSo, the author is defending their gift and expressing frustration over the cousin's girlfriend's comment. The core issue here is whether the author was justified in reacting the way they did.\n\nI should consider the context. The author spent a significant portion of their income on a meaningful gift. The cousin's girlfriend made a condescending remark, which the author took as an insult. The author then defended themselves, perhaps by pointing out the cousin's family's financial situation (since they were asking for money for diapers and formula but bought a game), which could be seen as a personal attack on the girlfriend's parenting. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The girlfriend's initial comment was rude, but the author responded by attacking her parenting decisions, which is more than just a simple rebuttal. While the author has a valid point about the financial sacrifice, bringing up the baby and financial requests might have been a harsh response. The author's comment about parenting could be seen as crossing a line, as it's a personal jab rather than a direct response to the comment about the gift. \n\nAlso, considering that the girlfriend was 20 and the cousin 26, the author's comment about parenting skills might be particularly sensitive. Even if the author felt disrespected, responding by criticizing someone else's parenting, especially when they themselves don't have children, might not be appropriate. \n\nSo, while the initial comment from the girlfriend was unkind, the author's response escalated the conflict by attacking the girlfriend's personal life and parenting, which is more than just defending their own gift. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and making a personal attack instead of just standing their ground politely.\n"
