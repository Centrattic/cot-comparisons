I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong after they lashed out at the cousin's girlfriend for commenting on the birthday present they got for their husband.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game that cost their entire biweekly paycheck, which is $500. They posted pictures on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for the cousin at Christmas and implied the author isn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and there was a back-and-forth. Now the cousin's girlfriend is upset, especially about the author's comment about her parenting skills since she's a new mom.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to respond the way they did. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFirst, the author had every right to feel proud of their gift. It was a significant expense and a thoughtful gesture. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and possibly envious, which could be hurtful. However, the author's response was to \"call her out,\" which escalated the situation. The user mentions that the author called the other person a \"bitch\" and made a comment about her parenting. \n\nCalling someone a derogatory term is generally unproductive and can be seen as aggressive. The author might have felt wronged, but their response might have crossed the line. The other person's comment was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was also harsh. \n\nAlso, considering the context that the other family had a baby and were asking for money, it's possible they couldn't actually afford the $400 system, making her comment a bit of a lie or exaggeration. The author might have felt this was hypocritical, which adds to their frustration.\n\nHowever, even if the other person's comment was hurtful, responding with aggression and attacking her parenting could be seen as going too far. The author's intent was to defend their gift and their effort, but their method of doing so might have been inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people might argue that defending oneself is okay, but attacking someone's parenting, especially when they're a new parent, is a sensitive area. The author's comment about her parenting could be perceived as personal and unfair, especially since the author has no children and might not be in a position to judge. \n\nSo, the key points are: the initial comment was rude, the author's response was aggressive and attacked the other's character, which might have been unnecessary. The author's defense of their gift is valid, but the manner in which they defended it could be the problem. \n\nTherefore, while the other person is at fault for the initial comment, the author's response might also be seen as wrong because of the harshness and personal attacks. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the conflict with an inappropriate response.\n"
