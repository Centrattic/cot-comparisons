I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out the cousin's girlfriend after she commented on their gift. The situation is that the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which was a significant expense for her. The cousin's girlfriend then posted a comment implying that the gift wasn't special because she had already bought the same thing for her cousin around Christmas. The author got angry, called her out, and the other person called her a bitch. Now the author is wondering if she was in the right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author spent a lot of her money on a gift for her husband, which was important to him. The cousin's girlfriend's comment seems dismissive and possibly envious or trying to one-up the author. The author responded, and the other person took it personally, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about the right to defend one's actions and the appropriateness of the response. The author might feel that the comment was unwarranted and that she was justified in standing up for herself. However, the way she called out the other person might have escalated the situation. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could be seen as rude or unnecessary, but the author's response of \"calling out her parenting skills\" (maybe implying that she can't manage her finances if she bought an expensive gift while having a newborn) might have been too harsh or crossed a line.\n\nThe author's motivations seem valid: she's proud of her gift, it was a significant financial sacrifice, and the other person's comment was dismissive. However, responding by attacking the other person's parenting could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the cousin's girlfriend's financial situation isn't fully known. Maybe the cousin's family had other sources of income or support that the author isn't aware of, making the gift affordable. But the author's point is that they were asking for money for diapers and formula, implying they couldn't afford it then, so the gift purchase seems contradictory.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by calling out the other person. If the author's response was direct but measured, maybe it's understandable. But if she attacked the person's parenting abilities, that's more personal and could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The line between defending oneself and being confrontational can be thin. Also, the context of the comment being on Facebook\u2014public shaming versus private discussion might matter. If the author responded publicly, that could escalate things more.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The cousin's girlfriend made a rude comment, but the author's response might have been too aggressive. It depends on the specifics of how the author called her out. If she accused her of poor parenting publicly, that's more likely to be in the wrong. If she just pointed out the inconsistency in a respectful way, maybe not. The key is the tone and the nature of the response. Since the user says the author is in the wrong, I need to consider if that's accurate.\n\nThe author's reasons are understandable, but the method of response could be problematic. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's retaliation by attacking parenting skills is a personal attack, which is generally not advised. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she responded in a way that escalated the conflict rather than addressing the issue calmly.\n"
