I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for attacking someone who criticized their husband's birthday gift. The situation is that the AITA bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin at Christmas, implying the AITA's gift wasn't special. The AITA then called her out, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The AITA is upset because the comment made her feel her gift wasn't special, especially since it was a big purchase for her. She points out that the cousin's family had a baby recently and asked for money for diapers, which could imply financial struggles, yet they could afford a $400 game. That's a valid point\u2014maybe the cousin's girlfriend is in a better financial position. \n\nBut the main issue is the response. The AITA called her out, and the girlfriend called her a bitch. However, the AITA went further and criticized her parenting skills. That seems like an escalation. The girlfriend's initial comment was about the gift, and the AITA responded by attacking her parenting, which isn't related. Even if the girlfriend's comment was rude, responding with an attack on her parenting is crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the AITA mentions they have no children, which might be why she's so quick to comment on parenting, but it's still not the appropriate response. The original comment was about the gift, not parenting. So by bringing up parenting, the AITA shifted the argument to a more personal level. \n\nThe user thinks the AITA is in the wrong, and I agree. Even if the girlfriend's comment was hurtful, responding with an attack on her parenting skills is not proportional and introduces a new, unrelated issue. The AITA should have addressed the gift comment directly without bringing in personal attacks. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
