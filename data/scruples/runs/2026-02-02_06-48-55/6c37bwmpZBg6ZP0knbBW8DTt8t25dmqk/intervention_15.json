I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift for her husband and a comment from his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for her cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and now the author is in trouble for calling out the other's parenting skills.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was justified. The initial comment by the cousin's girlfriend was pretty harsh. She's pointing out that the author's gift isn't unique because someone else got the same for her cousin. But considering the context\u2014author sacrificing money for the gift, while the other person had a baby and was asking for money for diapers but could afford a $400 console\u2014it adds layers.\n\nThe author's reaction was to call her out, which might have escalated the situation. However, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was dismissive and possibly envious. The author might have felt her effort and sacrifice were belittled. But publicly calling someone out might not be the best approach. However, the cousin's girlfriend's parenting is questionable if they could afford such a gift while needing diapers money.\n\nBut the author's response led to her being called a bitch and the author retaliating by attacking her parenting. The key here is whether the author overstepped. The initial comment was rude, so defending her gift makes sense, but attacking parenting skills might be crossing a line. She could have addressed the comment without bringing up their parenting. So maybe the author is in the wrong for escalating the conflict with a personal attack. Alternatively, if the other person's comment was unkind, maybe the author's reaction is understandable but not the best handled.\n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether the author's response was proportionate. The cousin's girlfriend made a snide comment, but the author's response about parenting might be too harsh. However, the author's justification about financial sacrifice and the other's ability to afford the gift could be a valid point. But the way she called out the parenting is problematic. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) for escalating the conflict beyond the initial comment.\n"
