I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after reacting to a comment from her husband's cousin's girlfriend. The situation involves a gift given to her husband and a social media confrontation.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted the pictures on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry and called the girl out, leading to an argument where the girl called her a bitch and the author is now justified in her response, even though it escalated to calling out parenting skills.\n\nThe key points to consider are: \n\n1. The author's intention was to share a proud moment, which was met with a comment that felt dismissive. \n2. The author felt justified because the cousin's family had financial struggles (a new baby, asking for money) yet could afford a $400 gift. \n3. The author's response was defensive and led to conflict, including a personal attack on parenting skills.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, reacting to a comment by attacking someone else's parenting is likely to be seen as crossing a line. The initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend, while possibly unkind, might not warrant a personal attack. The author could have responded differently, perhaps by explaining her perspective without escalating. However, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was also dismissive and possibly untrue (if they couldn't afford the gift given their financial situation), which might have contributed to the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's justification includes her financial sacrifice and pride in the gift. However, the appropriate response to a disparaging comment might be to express that the gift was meaningful regardless, rather than attacking the other person's choices. The mention of the cousin's family's financial situation adds context, but using that to attack parenting skills is personal and could be considered the author's fault.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the action taken was proportionate and respectful. The author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily, making her more at fault. Even if the comment was hurtful, responding with a personal attack is typically seen as in the wrong.\n"
