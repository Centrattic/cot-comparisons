I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday gift for the husband that another girl (his cousin's girlfriend) commented on, saying she bought the same for his cousin on Christmas and implying the author isn't special. The author then called her out, got into a conflict, and the girl is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author spent their entire paycheck (around $500 every two weeks) on the PS4 Pro and a game. The cousin's girlfriend had a baby in November and had asked for money for diapers and formula recently but could afford a $400 game system. The author felt justified in confronting the girl, leading to an argument where the girl called them a bitch and now the author is being criticized for attacking her parenting skills.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The author's intent was to defend their gift choice and their financial decision. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was likely meant to be a jab, possibly out of jealousy or spite. The author's response was to call her out, which escalated the conflict. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to confront the girl. While the comment was hurtful and possibly meant to belittle the author's effort, responding by attacking the girl's parenting might not be appropriate. The author could have chosen to ignore the comment or respond without bringing up the fact that the girl has a baby and asked for money. By using the girl's parenting as a counter, the author might have overstepped, adding a personal jab that could be seen as attacking her character rather than addressing the comment itself. \n\nThe girl's parenting skills are a sensitive topic, especially if the author is judging her based on the financial situation. Even if the author has no children themselves, bringing up the cousin's recent parenthood and the financial requests could be a way to shame the girl, which is not a mature or respectful response. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend is unkind and unwarranted, but the author's reaction of attacking her parenting might be the root of the problem. The conflict could have been de-escalated with a different approach. The author's pride in their gift is valid, but the method of defending it by bringing up another person's personal life is questionable. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for responding in a way that escalated the situation and attacked the other person's parenting, which is a more personal and sensitive issue. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
