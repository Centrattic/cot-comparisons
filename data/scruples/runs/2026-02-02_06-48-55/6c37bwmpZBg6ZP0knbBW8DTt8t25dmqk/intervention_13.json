I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's husband's birthday, where she bought a PS4 Pro and a game. She posted pictures of the gift on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had already bought the same PS4 for the cousin at Christmas, implying that the author's gift isn't special. The author then called the cousin's girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch. The author is now wondering if she was wrong to respond that way.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author bought an expensive gift for her husband, which she had saved for, and she was proud of it. The cousin's girlfriend's comment made her feel her gift wasn't special, especially since the cousin's family had recently asked for financial help. The author then confronted the cousin's girlfriend, leading to the conflict. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's response was justified. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was likely intended to belittle the author's gift by pointing out that someone else had already given the same item. This could be seen as a passive-aggressive or envious comment. The author's reaction was to call her out, leading to the confrontation. \n\nI need to consider social norms and boundaries. Commenting on someone else's gift being redundant or not special can come off as rude or dismissive. However, the cousin's girlfriend might have had a point if the PS4 was indeed a gift that another relative had already given. But the way she phrased it (\"you're not special\") adds a layer of personal insult. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to call the cousin's girlfriend out, which escalated the situation. The cousin's girlfriend then called her a bitch, which is harsh. The author then mentions calling out her parenting skills, which is another level of escalation. The cousin's family had asked for money for diapers and formula, which might imply financial struggles, but that's not necessarily relevant here. The author's anger could stem from feeling her gift wasn't valued and perhaps feeling judged about her financial situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was inappropriate and unnecessary. However, the author's response\u2014calling her out\u2014might have been excessive. Publicly confronting someone over a Facebook comment can lead to conflict and isn't always the best approach. The author's justification includes her pride in the gift and the financial sacrifice she made, which is valid, but responding in a way that attacks the other person's parenting (which wasn't part of the original comment) is likely crossing a line.\n\nSo, while the cousin's girlfriend's comment was wrong, the author's response was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is considering between A (yes) or B (no), the key is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's response escalated the conflict unnecessarily. Instead of responding with aggression, a more measured approach might have been better. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation with personal attacks.\n"
