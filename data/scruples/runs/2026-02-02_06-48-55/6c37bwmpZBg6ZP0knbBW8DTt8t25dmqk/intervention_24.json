I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift for her husband and a response from his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same gift for her partner on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and now there's some back-and-forth with insults. The author mentions financial sacrifice, spending her entire paycheck, and points out the other couple's recent financial requests vs. their ability to buy a $400 gift. The other person called her a bitch, and now the author is feeling justified in her response.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants to know. So, factors to consider: Was the author's reaction appropriate? Did the cousin's girlfriend overstep by commenting on the gift? The author's response seems defensive and confrontational. But did she have a right to feel upset? The comment might have been intended to diminish her effort, so responding in the way she did\u2014calling out the other person's parenting skills\u2014might be escalating the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nThe author's justification includes financial aspects and the other couple's financial situation. However, pointing that out publicly and making it personal could have been more hurtful. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was maybe meant to be snarky, but the author's response went beyond just defending herself. The user's perspective is that the author is in the wrong because she escalated the situation. The question is whether the initial comment was a valid reason to attack the other person. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the other person is 20, they have a baby, and the author's husband is 26. Maybe the author felt the other person was being judgmental. But responding with an attack on parenting skills, which isn't directly related to the gift comment, might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's reaction was defensive but escalated the conflict with personal attacks. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's response was more aggressive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how she responded, even if she had valid feelings. The answer would be A (in the wrong).\n"
