I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman defending her birthday gift for her husband after the cousin's girlfriend comments on it.\n\nFirst, the key points: She bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend replied that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift isn't special. The woman responds by being upset and calls the other person out, leading to an argument where the other calls her a bitch. The woman defends her actions, pointing out her financial situation and the other family's recent need for money for a baby, questioning their ability to afford the gift. Now the other is mad at her for criticizing their parenting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think. The woman felt her gift was being belittled, especially since it was a significant financial sacrifice for her. She felt justified in responding because she was proud of her gift. However, she attacked the other person's parenting by mentioning their recent baby and asking for money, which might be a sensitive topic. \n\nBut does that make her wrong? She was defending her gift from a perceived attack. However, bringing up their financial situation in a public or private argument could be seen as crossing a line. The other person's comment was about the gift itself, not about the woman's parenting or financial status. By bringing up the baby and their financial requests, she might have escalated the conflict by attacking the other's priorities or parenting choices, which is a different issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend's initial comment could be seen as dismissive and possibly envious. The author's response was defensive. But attacking someone's parenting, especially when they have a newborn, can be hurtful. The author's reasoning for her actions includes the financial aspect and the other family's situation, but using that to justify an attack on their parenting might be inappropriate. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to feeling disrespected, but the way she responded by bringing up the other's parenting could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The initial comment was about the gift, not about the author's parenting. The author shifted the argument to the other's parenting, which is a personal attack. Even if she felt slighted, replying with an attack on their financial decisions and parenting could be seen as the wrong response. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
