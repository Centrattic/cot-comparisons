I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a gift given to the husband and a comment from his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday, which was expensive. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented saying she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to the girl calling her a bitch, and the author defending her parenting skills.\n\nI need to analyze this step by step. The key points here are the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend and the author's response. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was a direct comparison, trying to diminish the significance of the gift. The author felt this was unfair because the gift was a big expense for them, and also because the other family had financial issues but could afford the same item.\n\nThe author's reaction was to call her out, which led to a confrontational response. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, reacting emotionally when someone tries to belittle your efforts is common. However, the way she responded might have been confrontational. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was a passive-aggressive jab, which can be hurtful. The author had a reason to feel offended, especially considering the financial context and the previous requests for money. \n\nBut the author's response was to attack the girl, possibly bringing up her parenting skills, which might have escalated the situation. Even if the girl's comment was rude, responding with a personal attack isn't the best approach. It's possible the author's reaction was defensive and crossed a line, even if she felt justified.\n\nHowever, the girl initially made a snide comment. The author's defense of her actions might be seen as standing up for herself, but the method (attacking parenting skills) is a personal jab. So, the question is whether the author's response was proportionate and appropriate.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, public shaming or personal attacks are generally frowned upon. Even if the initial comment was rude, responding with a personal attack might be seen as the author being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the comment was a direct challenge to her effort and financial sacrifice, she might feel it was necessary to defend herself.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author overreacted. The girl made a comment, and the author responded with a personal attack. That's a problem. Even if the comment was hurtful, the appropriate response might be to ignore or address it without attacking the person's character. So, the author's action might be seen as in the wrong because she escalated the conflict with a personal attack.\n"
