I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a comment from the husband's cousin's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author bought a PS4 Pro for her husband, which she worked hard for, and posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for her partner at Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author then \"attacked\" her, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch, and now the other is upset about \"parenting skills.\"\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intent was to defend the value of her gift, which she sacrificed financially. The other person's comment was dismissive and possibly condescending. The author's response, however, escalated the situation. The problem is whether her reaction was justified.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, responding harshly to being called out, especially in a public forum like Facebook, can be seen as inappropriate. Even if the other person was rude, attacking someone back can lead to further conflict. The author's financial sacrifice is understandable, but the way she handled it might have been unwise. \n\nAlso, the other person's comment about having a baby and asking for money while buying a $400 gift adds another layer. The author might feel the other person was being hypocritical. However, the author's response about \"parenting skills\" might have brought in irrelevant issues, which could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was rude and possibly unkind, but the author's response was defensive and aggressive. While the author has valid feelings, responding in a way that attacks the other person's parenting (which isn't related to the original comment) might have been the wrong move. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict and bringing up unrelated issues, even if she had valid reasons to feel upset. The appropriate response would be to ignore or calmly address the comment without personal attacks. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
