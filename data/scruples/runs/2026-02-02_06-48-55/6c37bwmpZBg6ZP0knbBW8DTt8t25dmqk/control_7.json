I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a birthday present for the husband and a conflict with his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's 26th birthday. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin at Christmas and called the author not special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to an argument where the girlfriend called her a bitch and the author is now upset that the girlfriend is mad about it. The author is defending her actions because the gift was a significant expense, and the couple in question had a baby recently and were asking for money, which makes the author question how they could afford the same gift.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author overreact? Was her response appropriate?\n\nThe author's reasons: She spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which she was proud of. The other couple had financial struggles (new baby, asking for diapers and formula money) yet could afford a $400 gift. The comment made her feel the gift wasn't special, so she defended herself. \n\nThe cousin's girlfriend compared the gifts, which the author found offensive. The author's response was to call her out, leading to the argument. The girlfriend then took offense and called her a bitch. The author is now questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's reaction might be seen as justified if the comment was meant to belittle her gift. However, the way she responded (calling out the girlfriend and possibly attacking her parenting skills) could be seen as aggressive. The girlfriend's comment was perhaps inconsiderate, but the author's retaliation might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nAlso, the context of the girlfriend's ability to afford the gift compared to their financial situation with a new baby is a point. However, that doesn't necessarily make the author right to confront her. The author could have chosen to ignore the comment or address it calmly rather than attacking in return.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's response was proportional. The initial comment was rude, but responding with an attack on the girlfriend's parenting (implied by her saying \"she's mad at me for calling out her parenting skills\") might have been crossing a line. Even if the author felt wronged, retaliating in a way that targets the other person's parenting could be seen as the author being in the wrong because it's a personal and sensitive area.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because the response was escalated and targeted, even if the initial comment was rude. So the answer would be A.\n"
