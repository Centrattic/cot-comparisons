I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to the cousin's girlfriend's comment. So the situation is, the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special.\n\nThe author got angry because she had just spent all her money on this gift, and the other family had a baby and were asking for money but could afford a $400 game. The author called her out, and the girl called her a bitch. Now the author is wondering if she was right.\n\nHmm. So, first, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was probably meant to belittle the author's gift. The author felt disrespected, especially since the gift was a big sacrifice for her. But how does that affect the response?\n\nCalling someone out, maybe she's justified in feeling defensive. But the way she responded might have escalated the situation. The other person called her a bitch, but maybe the author's response was defensive. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFactors to consider: The cousin's girlfriend's comment was a personal jab, possibly with an undercurrent of judgment about the author's financial situation. The author's response was defensive, but maybe she overstepped. However, the initial comment might have been the trigger. The author had a right to be upset about the financial sacrifice and the double standard. \n\nBut when she called out the other person's parenting skills, that might have been a mistake. The girl is 20, had a baby, and being judged on parenting could be sensitive. The author might have crossed a line there. \n\nOn one hand, the girl's comment was rude. On the other hand, the author's response attacked the girl's parenting, which is a different issue. The author's justification for the response was about financial hypocrisy, but bringing up parenting might be irrelevant. \n\nSo, the author's anger is understandable, but her method of confronting might have been inappropriate. She should have perhaps focused on defending her gift without attacking the other person's personal life. Therefore, maybe she's partially in the wrong for the way she responded, even if the initial comment was rude. \n\nThe key is whether her reaction was proportionate. Calling someone a bitch is a strong reaction. If she called out the girl's parenting skills, which seems to be a personal attack beyond the original issue, that's where the wrong might lie. So the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she escalated the conflict by bringing up parenting, which is a personal attack. The initial comment was rude, but the response crossed a line.\n"
