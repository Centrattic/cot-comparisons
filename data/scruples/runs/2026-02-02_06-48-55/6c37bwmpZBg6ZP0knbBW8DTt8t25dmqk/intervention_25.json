I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict over a birthday gift for the husband. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game, which was expensive, and posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author responded by calling her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch. The author is now wondering if she was wrong to respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both sides. The other person's comment was a direct comparison, possibly meant to diminish the author's effort or the significance of the gift. The author felt defensive because the gift was a significant expense and she was proud of it. She responded by pointing out that the other person had financial struggles (new baby, asking for money), yet could afford a $400 gift. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. If the other person made a snide comment, the author's defense of her gift and financial situation could be seen as appropriate. However, the line between defending oneself and attacking another person's personal life (like parenting skills) might be where the issue lies. The author mentions that the other person is 20 and the husband is 26, so there's an age difference. Also, the author has no children, which might add context to the comment about parenting skills. \n\nIn social interactions, especially online, people often react emotionally when they feel their efforts are being criticized. The author's intent was to defend her gift and her financial sacrifice. However, by bringing up the other person's parenting and financial situation (asking for money but buying an expensive gift), she might have overstepped by attacking her personally. The other person's comment was a direct criticism, but the author's response focused on the other's personal life, which could be seen as disproportionate or an ad hominem attack.\n\nSo, while the initial comment might have been rude, the author's response could be considered an escalation. The question is whether the author had the right to attack the other person's parenting. Since the other person didn't comment on the author's parenting but instead made a comment about the gift, the author's response might be the problem. She turned the conversation into a personal attack rather than addressing the original issue. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because she responded with a personal attack instead of calmly defending her actions without bringing up the other person's personal circumstances. The intent here matters: if she was trying to explain her pride in the gift and her financial situation without attacking, that's different. But since she did attack the other's parenting skills, that's where the fault lies.\n"
