I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for lashing out at the cousin's girlfriend over a birthday gift. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's 26th birthday. She posted a Facebook picture, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her cousin (the husband's cousin) on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and now is mad about her attacking her parenting skills. The cousin's family had a baby recently and asked for money for diapers and formula, which the author found hypocritical since they could afford a $400 game.\n\nNow, considering the facts. The author was upset because the comment made her feel her gift wasn't special. She had a financial reason (spending her entire paycheck) and felt the cousin's family's situation was inconsistent. She responded by calling out the cousin's girlfriend. \n\nThe key here is whether her response was justified. The comment was a direct comparison, which could be seen as dismissive of the author's effort. However, responding by attacking parenting skills (the part about the baby) might be crossing a line. The cousin's girlfriend didn't mention her family's financial situation; the author inferred that they could afford the game despite needing money for diapers. The author might have overreacted by bringing up the baby's expenses, which were not part of the original comment. \n\nAlso, the initial comment was a bit passive-aggressive but doesn't necessarily warrant a harsh response. The author's defense of her gift is understandable, but escalating the conflict by questioning the other person's parenting (which wasn't part of the original comment) could be seen as unfair. The cousin's girlfriend might have overstepped by making the comment, but the author's retaliation might have been more aggressive. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often get defensive about their gifts and spending, especially when it's a significant expense. However, attacking someone's parenting when they haven't brought it up is usually considered crossing a boundary. The author might have been in the wrong for making personal attacks that weren't directly related to the initial comment. \n\nSo, the author's response might be seen as disproportionate. The initial comment was a jab, but retaliating with accusations about parenting could be worse. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
