I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman whose husband received a PS4 Pro and a game as a birthday gift. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author then confronted the girl, leading to an argument where the girl called her a bitch and the author's response led to further conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about the author's reaction. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend seems dismissive and possibly envious or judgmental. The author felt her gift was undermined, especially considering the financial sacrifice and her husband's long-standing desire for the console. She also points out that the cousin's family had recently asked for money for diapers and formula, suggesting hypocrisy in their ability to spend on a $400 gift.\n\nThe author's response was to \"call out\" the girl, which might have escalated the situation. The question is whether her reaction was justified. On one hand, defending the significance of her gift and the effort she made could be seen as reasonable. On the other hand, responding in a way that led to a confrontation where she criticized the girl's parenting (implied by \"parenting skills\" comment) might be crossing a line. The author mentions they have no kids, so maybe there's a defensiveness there too.\n\nHowever, the initial comment was a direct attack on the value of her gift, which could be hurtful. The author's right to feel that her gift was important is valid. The problem might be how she handled the confrontation. If she called out the girl's parenting skills in the argument, that could be an overreach, especially if it's unrelated. But if her response was just defending her gift, that's different. The exact nature of her \"calling out\" isn't clear, but the result was the girl being mad about her parenting skills comment.\n\nI think the line in the sand here is whether the author's response was proportionate and respectful. If she was confrontational or attacked back in a way that wasn't related (like commenting on parenting when the issue was about the gift), then she might be in the wrong. But if she was simply defending her gift's significance, it's more understandable. The fact that the comment was dismissive and potentially hypocritical (given the cousin's family's financial situation) might justify her reaction. However, engaging in a public argument and bringing up parenting could be seen as inappropriate. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong (B), as defending the value of her gift is reasonable, but there's a nuance in how she responded. However, since the user is asking if she's in the wrong, and considering the context of the initial insult, the answer might be B.\n"
