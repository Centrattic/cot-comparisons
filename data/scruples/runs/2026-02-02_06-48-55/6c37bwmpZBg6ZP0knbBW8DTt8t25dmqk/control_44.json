I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, posted a picture on Facebook, and a cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin at Christmas. The author got angry, called her out, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which was a significant financial commitment. She's proud of the gift and the effort she put into getting her husband something he wanted. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend made her feel belittled, especially since the couple had recently asked for financial help for a baby. The author might feel that the comment was not only personal but also hypocritical given their financial situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend might have felt that the author was showing off or being boastful by posting the gift on Facebook. Her response could be seen as a way to point out that the gift wasn't unique or special. However, her approach was hurtful and possibly inappropriate, especially if the author was in a vulnerable financial situation. The author's reaction of calling her out might have been defensive, but the cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was the catalyst.\n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the comment and the appropriate response. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was likely meant to diminish the author's effort, which could be seen as a breach of etiquette. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, might be considered a reaction to being publicly shamed. However, responding with aggression might escalate the situation instead of resolving it.\n\nConsidering social norms, when someone shares a personal achievement or gift, and another person undermines it publicly, the first person might feel justified in defending their effort. However, using an aggressive tone can lead to further conflict. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, but the author's response of attacking her parenting skills seems to take the conflict too far. It's possible that the author overreacted, even if the initial comment was hurtful.\n\nFinancial situations and personal circumstances play a role here. The author's financial sacrifice and the cousin's family's recent requests for money add context to why the comment was hurtful. However, the cousin's girlfriend might not be aware of these details, which complicates the situation. The author's response, while understandable, might have been more effective if she addressed the issue privately rather than publicly.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the cousin's girlfriend initiated the conflict with a hurtful comment. The author had the right to feel upset and defend her actions, but the method of response (attacking parenting skills) might be where the author went wrong. It's possible that the author is in the right for standing up for herself against an unkind comment but in the wrong for responding in a way that escalated the conflict. The balance here is tricky, but the initial comment was more clearly the wrong action.\n"
