I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is wrong for attacking a girl who criticized her husband's birthday present. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's 26th birthday. She posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author got angry because she spent her entire paycheck (which is $500 every two weeks) on the gift, and she's upset because the other couple had a baby in November and were asking for help with diapers and formula but could afford a $400 game system. The author called the girl out, leading to an argument where the girl called her a bitch, and the author is now in trouble because she criticized the girl's parenting (since the girl is 20 and the other couple has a baby).\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's response. The original question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the cousin's girlfriend's comment: she's pointing out that the same gift was given earlier, which might make the author's gift seem less special. But the author's reaction is to call her out, perhaps pointing out the couple's financial situation (they had a baby and were asking for money but could afford the game). That could be seen as attacking her parenting or financial priorities. The author is also frustrated because she worked hard to get the money for the gift and was proud of it.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's defending her gift and her effort. But the way she responded might have been confrontational. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive, but the author's retaliation by bringing up their financial situation and parenting might be crossing a line. Even if the author felt wronged, attacking the other person's parenting (implying poor choices because they could afford the game while needing diapers money) is a sensitive topic, especially when the other person is young.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response is justified. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider social norms here. People might feel that the author was within her right to defend her gift, but using someone else's parenting as a weapon in an argument is generally considered harsh. Also, the cousin's girlfriend's comment, while maybe unkind, doesn't warrant the author bringing up their financial situation in a judgmental way. The author might have escalated the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nAnother angle: the author's intention was to defend her gift and her pride in it. However, the method she chose (attacking the other person's parenting) is problematic. Even if the cousin's girlfriend was wrong in her comment, the author's response could be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful, especially given the other person's age and situation. \n\nIn terms of social media interactions, people often regret responding impulsively. The author's reaction might be seen as overstepping, leading to the fallout. The fact that the other person is 20 and a parent might make the situation more sensitive. The author's comment about parenting skills could be perceived as elitist or judgmental, which is a common issue in such conflicts.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's response, while possibly stemming from justified pride and frustration, might have been inappropriate in how it targeted the other person's parenting. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the cousin's girlfriend was the initial aggressor, so the author had a right to defend herself. But the way she did it could be the problem.\n"
