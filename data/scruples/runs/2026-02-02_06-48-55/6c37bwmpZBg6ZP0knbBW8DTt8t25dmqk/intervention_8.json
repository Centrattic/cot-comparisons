I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which was a significant purchase for her, costing her entire $500 paycheck. She posted pictures of the gift on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special.\n\nThe author then responded by \"calling her out,\" which led to the other person calling her a bitch. Now the other person is upset with the author for commenting on her parenting skills, considering the cousin's family had recently asked for money for diapers and formula.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author spent a significant amount on a gift her husband had wanted for years. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend might have come off as dismissive or belittling, which could be hurtful. The author felt her effort and pride were undermined.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to \"call out\" the other person, which escalated the situation. The other person then retaliated, and the conflict turned into an argument about parenting skills. The cousin's family had financial struggles, but they managed to buy the same gift, which might be a point of contention. The author might have felt that the cousin's family wasn't in a good financial position but still could afford such a gift, which could add to her frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly calling out someone's parenting skills over a gift comment might be seen as crossing a line. The original comment, while possibly rude, might not justify a response that brings up sensitive topics like parenting. The author could have handled it by ignoring the comment or addressing it privately without attacking the other person's choices.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate and appropriate. Confronting someone publicly, especially on social media, can often lead to escalation. The author's intent was to defend her gift and her effort, but the method might have been too aggressive. The other person's parenting is a different matter altogether, so bringing that up might not be justified.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the cousin's girlfriend's comment was probably inconsiderate, the author's response might have been over the top. It's important to consider the impact of public confrontations and whether there's a more appropriate way to handle such situations. The author might have been within her rights to feel upset, but how she responded could have been better handled.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because she escalated the situation by attacking the other person's parenting in response to a comment about a gift. Even if the initial comment was hurtful, the way she responded was likely inappropriate and contributed to the conflict.\n"
