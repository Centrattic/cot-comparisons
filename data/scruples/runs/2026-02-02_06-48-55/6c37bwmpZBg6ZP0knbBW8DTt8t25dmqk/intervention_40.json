I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday gift for the husband and a conflict that arose when another person, the cousin's girlfriend, commented on the gift.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which she worked hard for, considering it a significant expense. She posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend then replied, saying she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author was upset because of the financial sacrifice, the other couple's financial situation (they had a baby and asked for money), and she called the girl out, leading to an argument.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the initial comment and the author's response. The cousin's girlfriend made a snide remark, which was dismissive of the author's effort. The author, however, responded by attacking the girl's parenting skills, which might have escalated the conflict. \n\nCalling someone a \"bitch\" is confrontational, and then the author called out her parenting, which is personal. Even if the comment was hurtful, responding with personal attacks might not be the best approach. The author's actions could be seen as defensive but perhaps overly aggressive. The girl's comment was inappropriate, but the author's response might have crossed a line by making it about parenting, which could imply judgment about her baby's care, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I should consider the context: the original comment was unkind, but the response was more aggressive. Even if the author felt disrespected, attacking the other person's parenting could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author might be at fault for escalating the situation with a personal attack.\n"
