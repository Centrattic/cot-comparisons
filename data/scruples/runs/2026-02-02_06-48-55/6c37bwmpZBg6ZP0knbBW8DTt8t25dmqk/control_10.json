I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict over a birthday gift for her husband. She bought a PS4 Pro and a game, posted pictures on Facebook, and a cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author got angry because the cousin's family had a baby and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet could afford a $400 game. She called the girl out, leading to the girl calling her a bitch, and now the girl is mad because the author criticized her parenting skills.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: she spent her hard-earned money (her entire paycheck) on a gift her husband wanted for years. She was proud of it and excited. The cousin's girlfriend's comment made her feel her gift was trivial, which frustrated her. She also points out the cousin's family's recent financial struggles, implying hypocrisy. She felt justified in defending her gift's value and her husband's appreciation.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive, but maybe she was just trying to share that her own gift was the same, perhaps not intending to belittle. However, the context of her family's financial situation adds complexity. The author's response of calling her out and criticizing her parenting might have escalated the conflict unnecessarily. The cousin's family might have the means to buy the game despite their other needs, but the author's response could come off as judgmental, especially since she mentions their child-related expenses versus the game cost. The girl's defensiveness might stem from feeling her own choices were being criticized.\n\nThe key points to consider: Was the author's reaction proportionate? Did she overstep by attacking the girl's parenting? The girl's initial comment was a comparison, but the author's response went beyond just addressing the comment. By bringing up the baby and the family's financial situation, she might have made it personal and criticized the girl's parenting, which the girl found offensive. The author's intent was to defend her gift's significance, but her method of doing so might have been inappropriate. The girl's reaction of calling her a bitch could be a result of feeling attacked in a personal way, not just about the gift.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author had a right to be upset about her comment, but responding by criticizing the girl's parenting skills might be crossing a line. The girl's comment was perhaps tactless, but the author's response escalated the situation. The author's defensiveness could have been perceived as attacking the girl's character rather than addressing the initial comment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how she responded, even if she felt wronged initially. The key issue is the proportionality of the response and whether personal attacks were justified. Since the author's actions led to further conflict and personal accusations, it's possible she overreacted.\n"
