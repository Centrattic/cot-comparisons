I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift for the husband. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game, which was expensive for her, and she posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author then called the cousin's girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and she defended herself by questioning the other's parenting (since they had a baby recently and were asking for money but could afford the expensive game).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author posted her gift on social media, which might be seen as sharing her excitement. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was confrontational and possibly meant to undermine the author's gift. The author's response was to challenge the cousin's girlfriend's comment, leading to an argument. The key points here are: the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend, the author's reaction, and the context of their financial situations.\n\nThe author's justification for calling out the cousin's girlfriend includes the financial sacrifice she made for the gift and the other couple's financial situation (needing money for diapers but buying a $400 game system). However, responding to a public comment with criticism might escalate the situation unnecessarily. The author's approach could be seen as confrontational, especially since the cousin's girlfriend was being dismissive. But the author's intent was to defend her gift's significance, which she had a right to feel proud of.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was inconsiderate and possibly envious or sarcastic. The author's response, while heated, was in defense of her actions. However, bringing up parenting skills might be an overreach, as it's a personal attack. The argument here is whether the author's response was appropriate given the context. \n\nIn terms of social norms, publicly calling someone out and attacking their parenting could be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial comment was rude. The author might have been better served by addressing the comment privately or not engaging at all. Therefore, while the cousin's girlfriend started the conflict with a mean comment, the author's public confrontation and personal attack could make her at fault. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she escalated the situation with a personal attack, even if she felt justified.\n"
