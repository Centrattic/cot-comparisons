I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for responding to a comment from her husband's cousin's girlfriend. The situation is about a birthday gift for the husband.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's 26th birthday. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author was upset because the gift cost her her entire paycheck and she was proud of it. She also points out that the couple had a baby recently and were asking for money, yet they could afford the $400 gift. The author responded by calling the girl out, leading to an argument where the girl called her a bitch, and now the girl is upset about being called out on parenting skills.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's accurate. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The girl's comment was clearly dismissive and maybe even a bit rude. She's trying to diminish the author's effort and pride by saying she bought the same gift earlier. However, the author responded by attacking the girl's parenting skills, which is a personal and possibly unfair attack. The girl's financial situation is mentioned\u2014she had a baby recently and was asking for money, implying they might not have had the means to buy the expensive gift. The author brings up the couple's financial status as a counterargument, which might be a stretch because even if they were tight on money, they could still have made the purchase. However, the author's response was to call out the girl's parenting, which is not directly related to the gift comment. That seems like a personal attack rather than a logical rebuttal. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a proportionate defense of her pride in the gift or an overreaction by attacking the girl's personal life. The original comment was about the gift, but the author shifted the focus to parenting skills, which is a different issue. That could be seen as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. Also, the girl's comment might have been a passive-aggressive remark, but that doesn't justify the author's response. The author could have responded by explaining her pride in the gift without attacking the girl's parenting. \n\nSo, considering the escalation and the personal attack, the author might be in the wrong. The initial comment was rude, but the response was even more so. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
