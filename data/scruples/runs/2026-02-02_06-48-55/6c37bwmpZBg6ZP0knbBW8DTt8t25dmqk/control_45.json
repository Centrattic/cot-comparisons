I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the author's gift wasn't special. The author got upset because the other family had just had a baby and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet they could afford a $400 gift. She called the cousin's girlfriend out, and the girl called her a bitch. Now the author is questioning if she was right to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author spent a significant portion of her income on a gift her husband wanted for years. She was proud of the gift and excited. The cousin's girlfriend's comment seems to be a jab at the author, possibly trying to diminish the effort or significance of her gift. The author's response was to \"call her out,\" which led to an argument.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for responding? Well, when someone makes a snarky comment that's personal, it's natural to feel defensive. The cousin's girlfriend's comment not only dismissed the author's gift but also implied that the author's contribution wasn't unique or meaningful. The author's reaction might be seen as a defense of her own efforts and possibly a critique of the other family's priorities, given their recent financial struggles. However, the way she responded\u2014attacking the other person's parenting skills\u2014might be crossing a line. Even if she felt justified in pointing out the financial inconsistency, bringing up parenting could be a sensitive topic, especially if the cousin's girlfriend is only 20 and the cousin is 26. \n\nOn the other hand, the comment the author received was rude and unnecessary. The cousin's girlfriend didn't have to make that comment, especially if the author's post was just sharing her joy. The author's pride in her gift is understandable, and the other person's comment could be seen as envious or mean-spirited. The author's response, while perhaps defensive, might be a reaction to being belittled. However, escalating the situation by calling out parenting might not be the best approach. It could be seen as personal and not directly addressing the initial comment. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the other family had financial needs but still managed to buy the gift. This might be a point of contention, but bringing up their financial situation in a public or confrontational manner could be sensitive. However, the author's response was directed at the cousin's girlfriend's comment, not necessarily the family's situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as defending her own actions in response to a direct attack on her gift. But her method of defense included attacking the other person's parenting, which might not be appropriate. So, there's a balance here. The initial comment was the cousin's girlfriend's fault for being rude, but the author's response could be seen as going too far by bringing up personal aspects unrelated to the original issue. However, if the author's criticism was about the financial inconsistency (they asked for money but spent it on a gift), that's a different matter. But if she attacked parenting skills without context, that's more about personal attacks. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a proportionate defense or an overreaction. Since she called out the cousin's girlfriend for her comment and then the cousin's girlfriend insulted her, maybe the author's actions were in self-defense. However, the mention of parenting might be the issue. If she didn't directly address the original comment but instead made a personal attack, that's where she could be in the wrong. Alternatively, if she was pointing out the contradiction in their spending habits, that's a different angle. But the way she phrased it, it's more about attacking parenting skills, which is a separate matter. \n\nIn summary, the initial comment was rude, and the author's reaction was to defend herself. However, her method of defense included a personal attack on parenting, which might not be justified. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for escalating the conflict with a personal jab, even if she felt the original comment was unfair.\n"
