I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lashing out at their husband's cousin's girlfriend after the latter commented on their gift. \n\nFirst, the user bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which was a significant expense for her. She posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend responded by saying she bought the same for her cousin at Christmas, implying it wasn't special. The user got angry, called her out, and the other person called her a bitch. Now, the user is wondering if she was wrong for responding.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: Did the user overreact? Was the other person's comment justified? And what about the financial situation mentioned\u2014how much does that affect the situation?\n\nThe user spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which shows she put effort into it. The comment from the other person might have been meant to diminish the significance of the gift. But maybe the user's response was defensive because she felt the gift was being devalued. However, responding aggressively could have escalated the conflict. \n\nThe other person's comment could be seen as a backhanded compliment, but it's possible she was just trying to brag or point out that the gift wasn't unique. The user might have felt disrespected, especially considering the other family's recent financial struggles. But even so, attacking someone else's parenting skills (as the user mentions the other person had a baby recently) seems like a personal attack that's not directly related to the gift comment. \n\nSo, the user's response might have been out of proportion. The original comment, while maybe unkind, didn't necessarily warrant a personal attack on the other's parenting. The user's anger is understandable given the financial sacrifice, but how she handled it might have been the wrong approach. \n\nAlso, the other person calling her a bitch could have been a reaction to the user's aggression. The user's defense of her parenting, however, might not be justified if that wasn't part of the initial conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user has valid feelings about the gift and her effort, her response may have crossed a line by bringing up parenting skills, which wasn't part of the original comment. Therefore, she might be at fault for escalating the situation inappropriately.\n"
