I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after responding to the cousin's girlfriend's comment about the birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She shared the photos on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for her cousin (the husband's cousin) on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and she might have criticized her parenting. The author is now questioning if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend seems dismissive and possibly envious. She's trying to undermine the author's thoughtful gift by mentioning she did the same for her cousin. This could be seen as petty or trying to belittle the author's effort.\n\n2. The author's response was to call her out, which led to escalation. The other person's response was calling her a bitch, and the author might have retaliated with comments about parenting. The author is now facing backlash.\n\n3. The financial aspect: The author mentions that the gift cost her an entire paycheck, and she worked hard for it. This adds context to why she felt the comment was unfair. The cousin's family had a baby recently and asked for money for diapers and formula but bought a $400 game. This could make the author feel that the cousin's girlfriend is in a different financial position, which might influence her perception of the comment's validity.\n\n4. The author's intention was defensive, protecting her gift and feelings. However, her response was confrontational. The other person's comment was negative, but the author's response escalated the situation. The cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was hurtful, but the author's reaction involved attacking her parenting, which might be out of bounds.\n\nNow, the ethical question is whether the author was justified in her response. On one hand, she had a right to feel disrespected and defend her gift. On the other hand, responding with a personal attack (parenting skills criticism) might be considered inappropriate. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was perhaps meant to provoke, and the author's response could be seen as overstepping by bringing up her parenting, which is a sensitive topic, especially since the author has no children. The cousin's family had financial difficulties, so maybe there's a misunderstanding about their situation.\n\nThe author's actions led to further conflict. Even if the comment was unfair, responding with a personal attack might not be the best approach. The initial comment was a put-down, but the author's response escalated it. So, while she might have a point in feeling wronged, her method of response could be seen as contributing to the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the escalation.\n"
