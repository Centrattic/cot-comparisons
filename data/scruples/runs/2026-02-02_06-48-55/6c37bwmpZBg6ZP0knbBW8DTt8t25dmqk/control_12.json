I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for attacking someone who criticized their birthday present. The situation is that the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which was a significant expense. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin at Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author then called the cousin's girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and is now upset about the author's comments on her parenting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's reaction is understandable because she spent a lot of money on a gift that her husband wanted for a long time. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might come off as dismissive and possibly envious. However, the key here is how the author responded. She called the other person out, which might have been confrontational. The cousin's girlfriend then called her a bitch, so the interaction escalated.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how she approached the situation. If she responded with hostility or made personal attacks, especially about parenting (since the other person is a new mother), that could be crossing a line. The user mentioned that the author is now upset because she felt justified in her response, but the other person is mad about the parenting comment. \n\nThe fact that the cousin's girlfriend made a comment about the gift being unoriginal isn't necessarily right, but the author's response should ideally be measured. Instead of publicly calling her out, maybe a private message or just ignoring the comment would have been better. However, if the author's response was in self-defense and not an aggressive attack, maybe she's not entirely at fault. \n\nAlso, considering the cousin's girlfriend's recent financial situation (asking for money for a baby) and then buying an expensive gift might be seen as hypocritical. But the author's attack on her parenting could be seen as a personal jab rather than a justified response to the comment. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about proportionality. The author had the right to feel upset, but responding with an attack on the other person's parenting might be disproportionate. So the author is in the wrong because she escalated the situation with a personal attack instead of addressing the criticism calmly.\n"
