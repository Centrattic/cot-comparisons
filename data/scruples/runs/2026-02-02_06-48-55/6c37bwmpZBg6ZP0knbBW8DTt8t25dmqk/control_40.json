I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a gift given to the husband and a conflict with his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday, which was a significant expense for her. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for her cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author then called her out, which led to an argument. The cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch, and now the author is defending her actions because she felt disrespected and also because the other couple had financial issues (they had a baby and asked for money for diapers and formula, yet could afford a $400 gift).\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author felt her gift was being belittled, leading her to confront the other person. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was dismissive, which the author found offensive. The author also points out the other couple's financial situation as a reason to question why they could afford such an expensive gift when they were asking for help for their baby's needs.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether her response was justified. The cousin's girlfriend made a snide comment that the author took as an insult. The author's response involved calling her out, which led to the other person's anger. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone publicly belittles another person's efforts or achievements, especially regarding personal investments, it's common for people to feel defensive. The author spent a significant portion of her paycheck on a gift she wanted her husband to have, and the comment hurt her pride and possibly made her feel embarrassed. Her reaction was to confront the person who made the comment, which in some contexts is a natural response. However, the way she confronted her might be seen as aggressive if she attacked or insulted her in return, which could escalate the situation.\n\nThe cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was rude and dismissive. The author might have felt that her financial sacrifice and the importance of the gift to her husband were being undermined. However, responding with confrontation could be seen as a valid defense of her feelings, especially if she felt disrespected. However, it's also possible that the author could have handled it differently, such as by politely explaining her perspective without attacking the other person.\n\nThe other factor is the other couple's situation. The author points out that they had a baby and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet they could afford a $400 gift. This could imply that the cousin's girlfriend is not being truthful about their financial status, which the author might have found hypocritical. In that case, the author's comment about their parenting skills could be a way of highlighting that inconsistency. However, bringing up someone's parenting skills as a retort might be crossing a line, as it could be seen as an attack on their personal choices and circumstances, which might not be fair or relevant.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the author's response was proportionate to the initial comment. If the cousin's girlfriend made a snide remark, the author's reaction of calling her out might be justified as standing up for herself. However, if the author escalated the argument by bringing up parenting issues, that could be seen as adding insult to injury, making the author at fault for the escalation. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the relationship, the author is 24, the cousin is 26, and the author has no children. The cousin's girlfriend is 20, which is significantly younger. The author might be implying that the cousin's girlfriend is not in a stable position to be making such a comment, given her young age and the recent addition of a baby. However, assuming that their financial situation is not as dire as they presented might be an assumption the author is making, which could be speculative.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's common to feel defensive when someone undercuts your effort or spending, especially when it's a personal sacrifice. However, the response should consider the other person's intent. Was the cousin's girlfriend trying to be mean, or was she just making a casual comment? If the comment was meant to be a friendly jab, the author's reaction might be seen as overly defensive. If it was clearly a mean-spirited comment, then the author's response is more understandable.\n\nAdditionally, the author might have overstepped by bringing up the other couple's financial situation and parenting choices, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy or a personal attack. Even if the author believed the other couple was being hypocritical, pointing that out in the heat of the moment might not be the best approach.\n\nIn summary, the initial comment by the cousin's girlfriend was rude, and the author felt justified in defending herself. However, the way she chose to respond by bringing up parenting issues and financial hypocrisy might be seen as going beyond the initial issue, leading to the conflict. Therefore, while the author's feelings are understandable, her method of response could be considered at fault for escalating the situation unnecessarily.\n"
