I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong after they lashed out at a cousin's girlfriend for commenting on their husband's birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which was a significant expense for her. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend responded in a way that made her feel her gift wasn't special. The author got angry, called the girl out, and got into an argument where the girl called her a bitch. The author is now defending her actions by pointing out the girl's financial situation (they had a baby and asked for money) versus her own sacrifices.\n\nSo, the key points here: the initial comment was probably snarky, but was the author's response justified? The girl's comment might have been mean, but attacking someone back, especially on Facebook, can lead to escalation. The author's reasoning about the financial situation and the fact that the girl's partner is her cousin's age might not be relevant. Also, the author's response led to further conflict. The girl might have overstepped, but the author's reaction could have been more measured. Maybe she could have addressed the comment privately instead of publicly calling her out. Public shaming or responding with aggression often makes things worse. So, even if the girl was being rude, the author's method of response might not have been the best. She could have handled it more calmly. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation instead of de-escalating it.\n"
