I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a birthday gift for the husband. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game he liked as a kid. She posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because the comment made her feel her thoughtful gift wasn't appreciated. She spent her entire paycheck, which is $500 every two weeks, so it was a big deal for her. Also, the couple who had a baby recently and asked for help with diapers and formula were able to buy a $400 game system. That might be a point about their priorities or financial situation.\n\nThen, the author called out the girl, and she called the author a bitch. The author then says she's defending her parenting skills, but the girl is now mad. Wait, the author isn't a parent, so maybe the girl is referring to her own parenting, but the author's family doesn't have kids. That part might be confusing.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for reacting the way she did? Let's break it down. The girl's comment was possibly dismissive or belittling. The author felt justified in pointing out that the girl's family had financial needs (diapers, formula) but could afford a $400 gift. However, the author's response might have been confrontational. Insults usually escalate conflict, so maybe the author overreacted. But the girl started by making a snarky comment about the gift, which could be seen as rude.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and how to handle criticism. The author's gift was a personal choice, and the cousin's girl had no right to belittle it. But the author's response of \"calling out her parenting skills\" might not be directly related unless the girl made a comment about parenting. Wait, the original comment was about the gift, not parenting. The author mentions that the girl is now mad about the author's comment on parenting skills. Hmm, maybe the author misinterpreted or misdirected her anger. If the author criticized the girl's parenting, that's a different issue, but the girl's original comment was about the gift. So if the author brought up parenting, maybe that's where she went wrong. The user's post says the author \"called out her parenting skills,\" but the girl's insult was about the gift. So if the author then criticized parenting, that might be unfounded and thus the author is in the wrong. However, if the author was just pointing out the financial inconsistency (buying a game when they needed money for diapers), that's a different matter. But the user's post says the author \"called out her parenting skills,\" which could be an irrelevant attack. Also, the author might have overstepped by bringing up the girl's family's financial situation, which could be a privacy issue. So the author's response, while perhaps understandable in feeling disrespected, might have been inappropriate in the method. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) for attacking the girl and bringing up unrelated issues like parenting. But if the author was just pointing out the financial hypocrisy without attacking parenting, then maybe not. The key is whether the author went beyond defending her gift and into personal attacks. The user mentions the author called out her parenting skills, which is unrelated to the original comment. So yes, the author is in the wrong because she escalated the situation with an irrelevant personal attack. Answer A.\n"
