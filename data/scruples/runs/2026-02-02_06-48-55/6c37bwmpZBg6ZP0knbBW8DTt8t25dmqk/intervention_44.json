I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted about it on Facebook, and her husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin at Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special.\n\nFirst, the author got angry and called the girl out, leading to the girl calling her a bitch. The author is now defending her actions, pointing out her financial situation and the fact that the other family was asking for money for a baby's needs but could afford the game.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The core issue is the response to the comment. The comment was a bit dismissive, saying the gift wasn't special because someone else did the same. But was the author right to respond by \"calling out her parenting skills\"? Wait, the author mentions that the girl is 20 and has a baby, and the author is pointing out that they were asking for money for diapers and formula but could afford a $400 game. That seems like a personal attack on her parenting, which is probably where the conflict escalated. \n\nSo the initial comment was a bit rude, but the author's response went beyond just defending her gift. She attacked the girl's parenting, which is a more personal and potentially hurtful move. Even if the girl's comment was mean, responding by criticizing her parenting decisions (especially regarding her child) is crossing a line. It's not just about the gift anymore; it's a personal jab about her financial priorities as a parent. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that she was angry about the financial sacrifice she made. That's understandable, but how she chose to respond was by attacking the other person's parenting, which is a separate issue. Maybe she should have addressed the comment without bringing up the baby or their financial situation. \n\nParenting criticism is a sensitive topic, and bringing up someone's parenting choices in an argument is usually a bad move. It can be seen as an ad hominem attack rather than addressing the original comment. The author's reaction might have been an overreaction, especially since the comment was about the gift's uniqueness rather than its quality or thoughtfulness. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's comment was condescending, which is annoying. But the author's response escalated the issue. So, in terms of right or wrong, the author's action of attacking the girl's parenting is likely the mistake here. Even if she felt wronged, responding with a personal attack isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because she responded with a personal attack instead of addressing the initial comment directly without involving the girl's parenting.\n"
