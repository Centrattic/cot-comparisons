I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for responding to the cousin's girlfriend's comment about her husband's birthday present.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which cost her a full paycheck. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had already bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry, called out the girl, and now there's a conflict.\n\nThe author's side: She's proud of the gift because it was a big financial sacrifice. She's upset because the girl's family was recently asking for money for a baby but could afford a $400 game. The girl called her a bitch, and the author defends her response, thinking she had a right to push back on the snide comment.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. \n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was passive-aggressive and possibly meant to belittle the author's gift. The author was defending her own effort and financial sacrifice. \n\n2. The author's response could be seen as defending her pride and the value of her gift. However, responding in a confrontational way (calling the girl out on parenting skills) might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\n3. The girl's comment might have been inconsiderate, but the author's response might have crossed the line. If the author attacked the girl's parenting, that's a personal jab and could be seen as retaliating in a harmful way, especially since they have children. \n\n4. Social norms around gift-giving and Facebook comments: People often share gifts, and comparisons can lead to hurt feelings. The author's reaction could be a mix of defensiveness and personal offense, but the method of response (attacking parenting skills) is problematic.\n\n5. The author's justification of financial sacrifice vs. the other family's situation. The girl's family having a baby and asking for money but buying a game system could be a point of contention, but the author's response here might be more about the snide comment than the actual financial situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was snarky and perhaps unwarranted, but the author's retaliation by attacking parenting skills is likely the issue here. People should avoid personal attacks even if they feel wronged. The author had the right to express her feelings but not in a way that targets the other person's personal life, especially concerning children. \n\nSo, while the girl's comment was inappropriate, the author's response was arguably more harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict with a personal attack.\n"
