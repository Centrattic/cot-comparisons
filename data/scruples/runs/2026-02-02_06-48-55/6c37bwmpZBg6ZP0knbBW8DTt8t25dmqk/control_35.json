I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted it on Facebook, and her husband's cousin's girlfriend commented saying she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and now the other person is mad.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's reaction was justified. The author felt disrespected because she worked hard for the money and was excited about the gift. The other person's comment could be seen as dismissive, maybe even a bit snide, especially considering the couple had asked for money for a baby recently. That might add to the frustration, making the comment seem hypocritical.\n\nBut then, the author's response was to \"attack\" the girl. The question is whether that's wrong. If she called out the girl's parenting skills, maybe that's crossing a line. The girl's comment was about the gift, but the author escalated it to parenting, which might not be fair. The girl didn't comment on parenting, so bringing that up could be personal and unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the comment was an insult to her gift and her effort. But reacting by attacking someone else's parenting without them saying anything about it could be seen as inappropriate. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate and relevant. If she just defended her gift and explained her perspective, that's one thing, but bringing up parenting skills when that wasn't part of the initial comment might be going too far.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the other person having a baby and asking for money, maybe the author felt the comment was hypocritical. But even so, responding with an attack on parenting is not addressing the original issue. It's a personal attack, which isn't constructive. \n\nSo the author's initial reaction to the comment might have been a valid feeling of being disrespected, but her response of attacking the girl's parenting skills is probably where she went wrong. That's a classic example of responding in a way that escalates the conflict rather than addressing the issue. Therefore, she's in the wrong for overstepping and making it personal where it wasn't necessary.\n"
