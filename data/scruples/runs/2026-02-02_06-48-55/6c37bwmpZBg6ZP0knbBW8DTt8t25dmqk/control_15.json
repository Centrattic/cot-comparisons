I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday gift for her husband and another girl claiming she already bought the same for his cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which was a significant expense she saved up for. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for his cousin on Christmas, implying the gift isn't special. The author then called her out, leading to a conflict where the other person called her a bitch, and now she's upset about the author's response, possibly involving parenting skills.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overreacted or had a right to respond the way she did. The author's motivations include her pride in the gift, the financial sacrifice, and the other family's recent financial requests. The other person's comment could be seen as dismissive or trying to diminish her effort. However, the author escalated the situation by calling her out, which might have been more than a simple rebuttal. \n\nI should consider if the comment was a harmless comparison or an intentional slight. The cousin's girlfriend might have felt the need to share her own gift-giving, but the way it was phrased (\"you\u2019re not special\") could come off as condescending. The author's reaction could be seen as defending her effort and the value of her gift. However, responding with a direct attack, especially on parenting if that's what the author targeted, might be crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the financial situation of the other family is mentioned\u2014they had a baby and asked for money but could afford a $400 gift. The author's comment might be based on resentment over their financial choices, which could be a separate issue. But using that as a reason to confront the girlfriend over a comment might not be the right approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intent was to defend her gift and effort, which is understandable. However, the method of confrontation, especially if it involved personal attacks or bringing up their parenting, might have been uncalled for. The other person's comment, while perhaps harsh, doesn't necessarily justify a hostile response. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation by attacking the other person, especially if she went beyond just defending her own actions and instead criticized the other's parenting. Even if the initial comment was rude, responding with a personal attack is not appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
