I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the wife bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game for his birthday. She posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the gift wasn't special. The wife got angry, called her out, and they ended up in an argument where the cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch, and the wife is defending her actions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The wife felt her gift was important because it cost her her entire paycheck, and she was proud of it. The cousin's girlfriend's comment made her feel belittled. The wife responded by calling her out, which escalated the conflict. The cousin's girlfriend is 20, the husband is 26. They have a newborn, so maybe financial situations are different, but the wife is pointing out that they were asking for money for diapers and formula, implying they might not have had the means to buy such an expensive gift.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was possibly dismissive of the wife's effort and pride. The wife's response was defensive, and now there's a conflict. The question is whether the wife was wrong to respond the way she did.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The cousin's girlfriend made a comment that could be seen as trying to diminish the wife's gesture. However, responding by attacking someone else, especially in a public forum, might not be the best approach. The wife's intention was to defend her gift and her pride, which is understandable. But the way she handled it\u2014calling the other person out\u2014might have been harsh or escalated the situation unnecessarily. The cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch, which is unkind, but the wife's initial reaction was in response to that.\n\nThe wife might feel justified because the comment was personal and affected her pride. However, by attacking the cousin's girlfriend's parenting skills, she might have crossed a line. The cousin's girlfriend is 20 and has a child, so the wife's comment about parenting skills could be seen as judgmental and inappropriate, especially since they don't know each other well. \n\nThe wife's reasoning includes financial aspects\u2014spending her entire paycheck on the gift, which she was proud of. The cousin's family had asked for money for diapers, so the wife's point is that they could afford a $400 gift while they needed help with basics. That's a valid point about their financial priorities, but bringing up someone else's parenting issues is a sensitive topic and might not be the best way to address it.\n\nIn terms of social norms, public shaming or calling someone out on social media can be seen as inappropriate. The wife's response might have been a knee-jerk reaction driven by hurt feelings. However, the cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was also unkind and possibly envious. The wife's right to defend her pride is understandable, but the method of doing so by attacking another person's parenting might not be justified.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the wife might not be entirely in the wrong because she was defending her effort and pride. However, her response could have been more constructive. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was the first transgression, but the wife's response escalated it. The key issue is whether attacking the other person's parenting was justified. Since the wife brought up parenting skills, which is a sensitive and personal matter, that might be where she went wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she escalated the conflict by making a personal attack, even if her initial reaction was in response to a hurtful comment.\n"
