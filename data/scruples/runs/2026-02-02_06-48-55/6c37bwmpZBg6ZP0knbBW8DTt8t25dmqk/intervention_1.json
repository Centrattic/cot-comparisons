I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for responding to the cousin's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her partner (the cousin) on Christmas and said the author isn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and the girlfriend called her a bitch. The author then called out her parenting skills, leading to more conflict.\n\nNow, considering the emotions involved. The author was proud of her gift and felt it was significant because she spent a lot of money. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend made her feel belittled, especially since the other family was asking for money for a baby's needs but could afford a $400 game. The author's reaction was defensive and confrontational.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she was reacting to a public criticism of her gift. However, escalating the situation by attacking the other person's parenting skills might have been excessive. Public shaming or personal attacks often aren't the best approach, even if the initial comment was hurtful. The cousin's girlfriend might have had her reasons for the comment, but the author responding with an attack on parenting could have been uncalled for. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had every right to defend her pride in the gift. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was dismissive and possibly insensitive given their financial situation. The key issue is how the author chose to respond. Instead of a direct confrontation, maybe a private conversation or ignoring the comment would have been better. But since she did respond, the escalation led to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the initial comment was hurtful, but the author's response of attacking parenting skills is where it becomes problematic. That's a personal jab and not directly related to the initial comment about the gift. So, the author might be in the wrong for taking the conversation to a more personal level. However, if the author had only defended her gift without attacking the other person, maybe she wouldn't be in the wrong. But since she did escalate it, she's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
