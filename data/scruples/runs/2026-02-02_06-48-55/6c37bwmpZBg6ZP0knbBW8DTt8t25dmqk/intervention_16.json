I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author posted a picture of a gift for her husband on Facebook, and the husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her partner at Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and they got into an argument. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation step by step. The key points here are:\n\n1. The author bought a gift for her husband, which was meaningful and costly to her. She's proud of it because she worked hard for the money.\n2. The cousin's girlfriend commented on Facebook, comparing their gifts, which made the author feel belittled. The author felt especially resentful because the other family had a new baby and were asking for money but could afford a $400 gift.\n3. The author responded by calling the cousin's girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and is now upset about the author's comments on her parenting.\n\nNow, considering social norms and appropriate behavior. When someone posts something personal online, others might comment, but how they respond matters. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might have been meant as a joke or a light-hearted comparison, but it came off as dismissive. The author's reaction was immediate anger, which led to a confrontation. \n\nIs calling someone out on Facebook over a comment about a gift appropriate? The author's response escalated the situation. While the comment might have been hurtful, responding with a direct challenge in a public forum (Facebook) could be seen as aggressive. The cousin's girlfriend felt her parenting skills were attacked, which the author might have done in her response. Even if the author felt wronged, the method of response\u2014publicly calling her out\u2014could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the other family had financial needs but could afford the gift. This adds context about potential financial hypocrisy, but bringing up others' financial situations in a public argument isn't productive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the cousin's girlfriend made a comment that was possibly inconsiderate, but the author's response was to escalate the conflict rather than address it privately or ignore it. Public shaming or confrontation in such contexts is often discouraged because it can lead to further conflict and hurt feelings. \n\nSo, even though the author might have felt her intentions were justified, the manner in which she responded is problematic. She could have handled the situation better by not engaging publicly or by addressing it privately with the cousin's girlfriend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the conflict in a public and confrontational way.\n"
