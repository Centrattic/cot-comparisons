I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the AITA question) is in the wrong for confronting someone who commented on their gift. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted a picture of the gift on Facebook. The husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for her cousin on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author was upset because she spent her entire paycheck on the gift, and the other couple had asked for money for a baby's needs but could afford a $400 game system. The author responded by calling the other person out, leading to an argument where the girl called her a bitch and the author defended herself, even bringing up the girl's parenting skills. Now the girl is mad at the author for commenting on her parenting.\n\nSo, the main points are:\n1. The author felt her gift was belittled.\n2. She was defensive about her financial situation.\n3. She confronted the girl, leading to a conflict.\n4. The author criticized the girl's parenting, which the girl took as an attack.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider both sides. The author had a right to be upset if someone dismissed her thoughtful gift, especially after she made a significant financial sacrifice. However, how she responded might be the issue. Calling out the other person's parenting is a common argument tactic, but it can come off as personal and attacking, which might escalate the situation. \n\nThe girl's comment could be seen as dismissive and maybe even a bit petty, especially if the author's gift was meaningful. However, the author's response by attacking the girl's parenting (possibly implying she's a bad parent because she bought a game for her cousin instead of focusing on her baby) is a classic example of bringing up personal issues to gain ground in an argument. That's usually not healthy and can be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the author's justification about the other couple having enough money for a game system when they asked for diapers and formula is a valid point, but bringing that up in a public comment might be seen as accusatory and not appropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author had feelings that were hurt, the way she responded by attacking the girl's parenting and making public accusations about their financial decisions might be where she went wrong. Public shaming or personal attacks are generally not advisable. The author might not be entirely wrong for feeling defensive, but her method of responding could be considered in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while she had valid feelings, her response was confrontational and crossed into personal attacks, which is generally not acceptable.\n"
