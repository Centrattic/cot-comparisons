I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong after lashing out at someone who commented on their husband's birthday gift. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which was a significant expense for her. She posted about it on Facebook. A cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the author's gift wasn't special. The author was upset because she had to spend her entire paycheck on the gift, which her husband had wanted for years. Additionally, the other couple had a newborn and were asking for money for diapers but could afford the same game. She called the other girl out, leading to a confrontation where the girl called her a bitch, and the author is now defending her actions.\n\nNow, considering the factors. The author was defending her own choice to spend her hard-earned money on her husband's gift. The other person's comment was dismissive and possibly envious, which can be hurtful. The author's reaction, while strong (\"pissed as fuck\" and calling the girl out), was in response to feeling belittled. However, using aggressive language or attacking the other person's parenting skills (as she did) might escalate the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The author had a right to feel hurt and defensive about her gift's value, especially given her financial situation. However, responding by attacking the other person's parenting could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the original comment didn't mention her parenting. The author's actions might have been an overreaction, even if her feelings were valid. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the other couple's financial situation (new baby, asking for money), the author's frustration is understandable. But attacking parenting skills isn't the right approach. A better response might have been to explain her perspective calmly without personal attacks.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid reasons to be upset, her response was inappropriate. She shouldn't have attacked the other person's parenting. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
