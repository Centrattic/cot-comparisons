I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift between two couples.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which was a significant expense for her. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author then called the cousin's girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch. Now the author is defending her actions.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. The author's intention was to share a proud moment. The comment from the other person was dismissive and possibly envious. The author felt her effort and sacrifice were belittled, especially since she had to use her entire paycheck for the gift. The other couple had recently asked for money for a baby but could afford a similar gift.\n\n2. The author responded by calling out the other person's parenting skills, which might have escalated the situation. The other person is 20, and the author is 24, so there's an age difference, but it's not huge. The cousin is 26, so the girlfriend might be in a relationship with someone older. The author also mentions they have no children, which might be relevant if the comment about parenting skills is about the other person's ability to raise a child while buying expensive gifts.\n\n3. The question is whether the author was wrong to respond as she did. The other person's initial comment was rude and possibly meant to diminish the author's gesture. The author's response was defensive and possibly crossed a line by attacking the other's parenting. Even if the author felt wronged, responding with an attack on parenting skills might be unwarranted, especially if the other person didn't deserve that.\n\nPossible angles: The author was within her rights to defend her pride in the gift, but attacking the other person's parenting was uncalled for. The other person's comment was toxic, but the author's response escalated the conflict. The context of financial sacrifice adds nuance, but the way she responded might have been excessive. The other person's comment could be seen as passive-aggressive, but the author's reaction was hostile. \n\nConsidering the dynamics, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling defensive, but her method of response could be the issue. However, the original comment was clearly unkind, and the author's retaliation might be justified in her eyes. The key is whether her response was proportionate. If the other person made a snide remark, the author's response of attacking parenting skills might be disproportionate unless there was prior context. Without more info, it's a judgment call. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person overreacted. If the author's actions were a direct response to being insulted, but she took it too far by bringing up parenting, she might be partially at fault. The other person's initial comment was mean, but the author's response was more aggressive. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she escalated the conflict by attacking parenting skills when the other person didn't deserve that. Alternatively, if the comment was a valid point about the other couple's financial situation, maybe not. But the parenting attack seems out of scope. So likely A.\n"
