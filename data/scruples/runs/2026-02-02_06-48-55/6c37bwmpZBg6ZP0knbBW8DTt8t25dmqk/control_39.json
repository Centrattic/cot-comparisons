I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by responding to the cousin's girlfriend's comment about her husband's birthday present. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for her partner on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and the author called out her parenting skills.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author mentions she spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which shows it was a big deal for her. The other couple had a baby in November and asked for money for essentials but could afford a $400 game. The author felt disrespected, so she responded. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are about the appropriateness of her response. The girlfriend made a snide comment, but the author escalated it by \"calling out her parenting skills.\" That part is problematic because even if the other person was rude, attacking her parenting (which might be a personal issue) could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the initial comment about the gift being bought on Christmas might have been meant to diminish the author's gesture, but the author's response was hostile. The author's defense is about the financial sacrifice and the other couple's financial situation, which adds context to her frustration. However, responding in a confrontational way, especially bringing up parenting, could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, while the author has valid feelings about her gift and the financial aspect, the way she handled the confrontation might not be the best approach. She could have addressed it calmly, but her response was aggressive and personal. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict and making personal attacks.\n"
