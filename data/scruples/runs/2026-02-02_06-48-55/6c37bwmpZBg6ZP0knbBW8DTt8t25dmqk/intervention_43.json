I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday, which cost her her entire paycheck. She posted the pictures on Facebook, and her husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the gift wasn't special. The author got angry and called the girl out, leading to the girl calling her a bitch. The author is now wondering if she was wrong to respond that way.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial comment and the author's response. The girl's comment could be seen as dismissive or trying to undermine the thoughtfulness of the gift. The author might feel that this was a personal slight, especially since the gift was a significant sacrifice for her. However, the way she responded by calling out the girl's parenting skills (implying that the girl couldn't afford the gift because they had a baby and were asking for money) might have been harsh.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette, if someone makes a comment that you perceive as belittling, it's natural to feel defensive. But responding in a way that attacks the other person's parenting could escalate the situation. The girl's comment was about the gift, not about the author's financial situation or family choices. By bringing up the baby and the financial requests, the author might have overstepped and made it personal, which could be seen as the wrong move.\n\nMoreover, comparing gifts and who can afford them isn't usually a productive conversation. The girl's comment was probably meant to show that the gift wasn't unique, but the author's response turned it into a judgment of the girl's parenting decisions. That's where the conflict escalated. Even if the author felt wronged, responding with a personal attack is generally considered rude, which is why AITA forums often lean towards the person in the wrong if they escalate conflicts with personal jabs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the initial comment was probably unkind, but the author's response crossed a line by attacking the girl's parenting. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
