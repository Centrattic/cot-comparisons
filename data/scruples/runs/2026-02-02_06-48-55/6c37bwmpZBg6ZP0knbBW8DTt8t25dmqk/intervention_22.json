I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a comment about their husband's birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author responded, leading to an argument where the cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch, and the author might have criticized her parenting since they have a baby. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, why would the author be in the wrong? Well, reacting to a comment online can sometimes escalate things. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might have come off as dismissive or rude, but the author's response of calling her out could have been the trigger. Also, bringing up the fact that they had enough money for a $400 gift when they were asking for money for diapers might be seen as a personal attack, which is probably why the cousin was defensive. The author might be overstepping by critiquing someone else's parenting, especially if it's not relevant to the original issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. She worked hard for the money and was proud of her gift. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could be seen as passive-aggressive, especially if they had recently asked for help with baby expenses. The author might feel that the comment was unfair, especially if they had financial struggles themselves.\n\nBut the key here is the reaction. Even if the comment was rude, responding with an attack on the other person's parenting skills is likely to make things worse. The author's response escalates the conflict instead of addressing the initial issue. People should be able to express their feelings without attacking others, especially in a public forum like Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might have been insensitive, but the author's response crosses into personal attacks, which is generally not advisable.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions led to further conflict. While the initial comment was rude, the way the author handled it\u2014by attacking the other person's parenting\u2014seems to be the problem. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because she escalated the situation with a personal attack instead of addressing the issue directly and respectfully.\n"
