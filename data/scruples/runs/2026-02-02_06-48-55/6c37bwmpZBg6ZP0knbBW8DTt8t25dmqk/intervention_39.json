I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for attacking the girl after she commented on their husband's birthday gift. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for the cousin at Christmas, implying the author's gift isn't special. The author got angry because the couple had asked for money for a baby's needs recently, yet could afford a $400 gift. She called the girl out, leading to an argument where the girl called her a bitch, and now the girl is upset about the author's parenting remarks.\n\nNow, evaluating right and wrong. The author's reaction: She felt her gift was devalued. It's understandable to be upset if someone dismisses your thoughtful gesture. However, responding by attacking the girl's parenting skills (since the author mentioned the girl is 20 and the couple is new parents) might be crossing a line. Even if the author's intent was to defend her gift, bringing up the baby's needs could come off as judgmental. The girl's comment was a personal opinion, and while it was rude, the author's response might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect: The author mentions the gift cost her entire two-week paycheck, which adds to the emotional investment. But the cousin's girlfriend's comment doesn't justify a harsh response, especially if it involves personal attacks. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. Arguing the point without personal jabs might have been more appropriate. \n\nSo, while the author has valid feelings, her method of response might be in the wrong. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her response was justified. Since she escalated it with personal criticism, that's likely where the fault lies. So Answer A.\n"
