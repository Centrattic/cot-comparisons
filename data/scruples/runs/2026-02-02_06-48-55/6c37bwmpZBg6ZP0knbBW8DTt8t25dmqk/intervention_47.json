I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between two women: the author and her husband's cousin's girlfriend. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought a similar gift for her partner on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry, called the other woman out, and now the other woman is mad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author spent a significant amount of money (her entire two-week check) on a gift that her husband had wanted for years. The other woman, who recently had a baby and was asking for help with baby expenses, had enough money to buy a $400 game system. The author felt that the comment was dismissive of her effort and the expense involved. She responded by \"calling out\" the other woman's parenting skills, which led to the other woman being angry and calling her a bitch.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nTo decide, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The other woman made a comment that could be seen as trying to diminish the author's gift. However, the author's response was to call out the other woman's parenting skills, which might be a personal attack. The author's reasoning includes feeling that the other woman had less financial need but spent similarly, which adds context. \n\nBut is the author justified in her response? The initial comment might have been mean, but responding by attacking the other person's parenting could escalate the conflict unnecessarily. The author's post on Facebook might have been a way to share her joy, and the other person's comment was a petty response. However, the author's reaction was to confront the person publicly or privately? The story doesn't specify how she \"called out\" the other woman, but if it's on social media or in a public forum, that could be problematic. If she attacked her parenting skills, which is a personal and sensitive topic (especially since the other woman has a young child), that might be crossing a line. Even if the author felt slighted, responding with an attack on the other's parenting might be inappropriate and unkind.\n\nHowever, the author also had valid reasons to feel hurt\u2014she spent a lot of money and was proud of the gift. The other woman's comment could be seen as belittling her effort. But the author's method of responding might have been overly harsh. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and attacking another person's personal choices. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling upset, but her response could be seen as the wrong approach. So, perhaps the answer is A (she is wrong) because she escalated the situation by attacking the other person's parenting instead of addressing the comment directly without personal attacks. Alternatively, if the other person's comment was clearly mean, the author's reaction might be a form of defending her own actions, but in a way that's not constructive. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A, she is in the wrong for how she responded.\n"
