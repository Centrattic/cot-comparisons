I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, and posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented saying she bought the same for the cousin at Christmas, implying it wasn't special. The author got angry, mentioned their financial situation (she works hard, spends her entire biweekly paycheck), and the cousin's family had a baby and were asking for money, so she called the girlfriend out. The girl called her a bitch, and now the author is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's main arguments are her pride in the gift, the financial sacrifice, and the cousin's family's financial situation. The girl's comment was dismissive of her gift. The author responded by confronting her, which led to an argument.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was rude and dismissive. People often compare gifts, which can be hurtful. The author had every right to feel offended. However, the way she responded might be the issue. She called the girl out, possibly bringing up the baby and their financial struggles, which could be seen as attacking her parenting. That might be crossing a line, even if the initial comment was wrong. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether her response was justified. Since the cousin's girlfriend was the one who made the dismissive comment first, the author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, might be seen as a defense of her effort and sacrifice. However, bringing up their financial situation and implying poor parenting could be where she went overboard. So maybe she's partially at fault for escalating the situation, but not entirely. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about who started the conflict. The cousin's girlfriend started it, so the author might not be in the wrong. But if her response was overly aggressive or brought up irrelevant points, that could make her at fault. The user wants a choice between A and B. Considering all, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the initial comment was rude, but the response's tone might be a factor. However, given the context, the author had valid reasons to be upset, so the answer is B.\n"
