I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's husband got a PS4 Pro and a game for his birthday. They posted a Facebook picture of the gift. The cousin's girlfriend commented saying she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author got really mad because the gift was a big financial commitment for them (costing their entire paycheck) and they were proud of it. Also, the cousin's family had a baby recently and were asking for money for diapers and formula, so the author is upset that they could afford a $400 gift. The author called the girlfriend out, and she called them a bitch. Now the girlfriend is mad, and the author is questioning if they were right to respond that way.\n\nSo the main points here are: The author was defending their own gift choice and pride in it, feeling that the girlfriend's comment was dismissive. The author's response might have been harsh, but the girlfriend's initial comment was also confrontational. The financial aspect is important here because the author had to use their entire paycheck for the gift, which they were excited about. The girlfriend's family had financial struggles recently, which adds to the author's frustration that they could afford such a gift.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend made a comment that was meant to be dismissive of the author's gift, implying it wasn't special because someone else had already given it. The author's reaction was to call her out, which might have been harsh, but was it justified?\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone receives a gift, others shouldn't belittle it unless it's a sensitive issue like appropriateness. The girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on the author's pride and effort. The author's response could have been more measured, but the initial comment was rude. However, responding by attacking her parenting skills (since they had a baby and were asking for help) might have escalated the situation. The author's justification for their anger is understandable, but their response might have been too harsh.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The girlfriend started by mocking the gift, and the author felt justified in defending it. However, the author's response could have been more diplomatic. That said, the initial act of calling someone out might be seen as a valid response to a perceived slight. But attacking the girlfriend's parenting skills (due to their financial situation) might be crossing a line. It's possible that the author's anger was valid, but the way they responded was inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the conflict by attacking the girlfriend's parenting, which is a sensitive area, even if the initial comment was rude.\n"
