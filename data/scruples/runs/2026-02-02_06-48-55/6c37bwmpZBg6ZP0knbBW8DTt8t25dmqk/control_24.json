I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for calling out the cousin's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her cousin (the husband's cousin) on Christmas, implying that the author isn't special. The author got angry, considering she had to spend her entire paycheck, and the cousin's family had a baby recently and were asking for help with diapers and formula but could afford a $400 gift. The author called her out, leading to an argument where the girlfriend called her a bitch, and the author is now wondering if she was right to respond that way.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author felt her gift was being belittled, she put a lot into it financially, and there's a context where the cousin's family had financial needs but could afford the same gift. The author's response was to call out the cousin's girlfriend, which led to the conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider if her reaction was justified. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend was dismissive of the author's gift, which could be seen as a jab at the author's effort or the husband's birthday. The author's response was defensive, pointing out the financial sacrifice and the cousin's family's recent financial situation. However, the author escalated the situation by calling out the cousin's parenting skills, which might have been a personal attack and thus inappropriate.\n\nThe key factors here are: \n\n1. The initial comment by the cousin's girlfriend was disrespectful, which the author had a right to be upset about. \n2. The author's response included a critique of the cousin's family's financial situation, which might be valid but could come off as judgmental. \n3. The author then escalated by attacking the cousin's girlfriend's parenting, which is likely where she went over the line. \n\nEven though the original comment was offensive, responding by attacking someone's parenting is a personal and sensitive issue. The cousin's girlfriend was 20, and the author is 24, so there's an age difference. Also, the author mentions that they have no children, which might make the parenting critique less relevant or a stretch. \n\nIn terms of social media interactions, it's important to maintain respect even when defending oneself. The author's intention was to defend her gift and her husband's birthday, but her method of response might have been too confrontational and led to further conflict. The phrase \"calling out her parenting skills\" suggests that the author went beyond the initial issue, which is a common mistake in online arguments. \n\nSo, while the author had valid reasons to be upset, her response was likely not the best approach. The right to defend oneself doesn't mean the response was appropriate. The key issue is that she escalated the conflict by introducing a personal attack on parenting, which is a sensitive area, especially since the cousin's girlfriend is 20 and the author isn't a parent herself. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for escalating the argument by attacking the cousin's girlfriend's parenting skills. While the initial comment was rude, the response crossed a line into personal criticism that wasn't necessary to address the original issue.\n"
