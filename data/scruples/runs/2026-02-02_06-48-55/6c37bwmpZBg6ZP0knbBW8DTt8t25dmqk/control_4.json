I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday, which cost her her entire two-week paycheck. She posted about it on Facebook, and her husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she had already bought the same thing for the cousin at Christmas, implying that the author's gift wasn't special. The author got really mad, called her out, and then the other person called her a bitch. The author then called her out for parenting skills, leading to more conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt disrespected because she had put a lot of effort and money into the gift, which was a big deal for her financially. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could be seen as belittling her gesture, which might sting, especially if they had asked for money for diapers and formula not long before. That could add to the author's frustration, wondering why they could afford such an expensive gift when they were asking for help with baby expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend might have thought she was just sharing that the cousin got the same gift earlier, not necessarily trying to insult the author. Maybe she didn't realize how personal it would come across. But the way she phrased it, \"you\u2019re not special,\" does sound a bit dismissive or condescending.\n\nThe author's response was to call her out, which escalated the situation. By bringing up parenting skills, she might have crossed a line, especially if the cousin's girlfriend was just being provocative. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified. She was defending her pride in the gift and possibly feeling attacked about her financial situation. However, responding with an attack on the other person's parenting could be seen as uncalled for, even if she was upset.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The initial comment was a jab, and the author's response was more aggressive. Even if the author felt wronged, calling out parenting skills might not be a fair retort. It's possible that the author's anger was valid, but her method of responding could have been more constructive. Maybe a private message to explain her feelings instead of public confrontation?\n\nAlso, considering the context of the other person's recent financial situation (new baby, asking for money), the author might feel that the cousin's girlfriend shouldn't have spent so much on a gift. But that's more about the cousin's choices than the comment itself. The cousin's girlfriend's comment about the gift not being special is separate from their financial decisions. The author conflated the two, which might not be fair.\n\nIn terms of social norms, public shaming or attacking someone's parenting can be seen as harsh, especially in a family context. The author's actions might have been a defensive reaction, but they did escalate the conflict. The cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was rude, but the author's response was even more so.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had a right to feel upset, but her response was perhaps too aggressive. The correct answer here might be A (she's in the wrong) because her reaction went beyond just addressing the initial comment and instead targeted the other person's parenting, which could be seen as the wrong approach. However, others might argue that she had a right to defend her pride. But given the options, A is more likely the answer intended here.\n"
