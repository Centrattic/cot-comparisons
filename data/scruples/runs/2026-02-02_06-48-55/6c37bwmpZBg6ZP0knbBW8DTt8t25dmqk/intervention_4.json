I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a comment about her husband's birthday gift. The situation involves the author's husband's cousin's girlfriend saying that she bought the same gift for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author then called her out, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author spent a significant amount of her income on a gift that her husband wanted for years. She was proud of her purchase and excited for him. The cousin's girlfriend made a comment that could be seen as diminishing the effort and thought behind the gift. The author felt defensive and called her out, which led to the other person being confrontational.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was probably meant to undermine the author's effort, even if she didn't realize the implications. The author had the right to feel defensive because the gift was a personal and meaningful gesture. However, responding by attacking the other person's parenting skills might be crossing a line. The author mentions that the cousin's family had recently asked for money for diapers but bought an expensive gift, which she used as a counterpoint. But bringing up the family's financial situation in a public or argumentative context could be seen as personal and harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial reaction was to defend her own actions, which is understandable. People can get defensive when their efforts are belittled. However, the way she responded\u2014possibly attacking the other person's parenting\u2014might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and engaging in a personal attack.\n\nThe key points are the intent of the original comment and the proportionality of the response. The original comment was a slight, but the response went beyond addressing the comment to attacking the other person's life decisions. That's where the author might be at fault. Even if the intention was to point out hypocrisy, the method could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because her response was more aggressive and personal than necessary. But it's a nuanced situation. However, given the options, the answer would likely be A (Yes) because attacking someone's parenting is a harsh response to a comment about a gift.\n"
