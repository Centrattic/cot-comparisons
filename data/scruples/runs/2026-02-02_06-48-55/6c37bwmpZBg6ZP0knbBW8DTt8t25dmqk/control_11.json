I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a Facebook comment from the cousin's girlfriend where she says that the gift the author bought for her husband was something she had already given to his cousin during Christmas. The author then \"called her out\" and now there's some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author spent a significant portion of her income on a gift her husband really wanted. The other person, who recently had a baby and was asking for money for diapers and formula, claims to have bought the same gift for her own partner's cousin. The author is upset because this makes her feel her gift isn't special, and she called the other person out, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might have been dismissive or condescending, implying that the author's gift wasn't unique or special. That could be hurtful, especially if the author took a lot of pride in buying that gift. However, the way the author responded by \"attacking\" her and calling her out could be seen as aggressive. The other person called her a bitch, but the author might feel justified because of the financial sacrifice she made and the context of the other family's recent financial requests.\n\nBut is it right to confront someone over a comment on social media? Maybe the author's reaction was a bit harsh. The cousin's girlfriend might have been trying to be humorous or make a point, but the author took it personally. However, the financial aspect is a factor here\u2014spending a whole paycheck on a gift is a big deal, and feeling undermined can be really frustrating.\n\nAlso, the fact that the other family was asking for money for diapers and formula, yet could afford a $400 game system, is a point the author brings up. That might add to the feeling of hypocrisy, which could influence her reaction. But bringing up someone's parenting or financial habits (even if true) might have escalated the situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible that both parties misstepped. The cousin's girlfriend made a comment that hurt the author's feelings, and the author responded in a confrontational way. However, given the emotional investment in the gift and the context of the comment, the author might feel she had a right to defend her choice. Still, attacking someone's parenting skills, even if not directly stated, could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, the answer might be a bit nuanced. The author might be partially in the wrong for responding aggressively, but the initial comment was also rude. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the focus is on her response, then A (yes) might be the answer. But if the context of her financial sacrifice and the other person's comment being dismissive is considered, maybe B (no). \n\nHmm. I think in the \"AITA\" context (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at both sides. The author's reaction was defensive, but attacking the other person's parenting (even indirectly) could be seen as a step too far. So the author is likely in the wrong for escalating the conflict in a harsh way. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
