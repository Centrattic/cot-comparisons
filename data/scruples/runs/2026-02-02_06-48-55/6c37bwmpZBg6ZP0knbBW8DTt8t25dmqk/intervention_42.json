I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's husband got a PS4 Pro for his birthday, and the author posted a picture of it on Facebook. Then the husband's cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought one for the cousin on Christmas and that the author isn't special. The author got angry, called the girl out, and now the girl is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the gift cost her an entire paycheck, which was $500 every two weeks. She was proud of the gift because her husband had wanted it for years. Also, the cousin's family had just had a baby and were asking for money for diapers and formula two weeks ago, yet they could afford a $400 game system. \n\nThe author responded by calling the girl out, but the girl called her a bitch, and now the author is questioning if she was right. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what others think. The answer should be A or B.\n\nSo, to evaluate if the author is in the wrong, I need to think about the reasons for her reaction. The girl's comment was meant to diminish the author's effort and the significance of the gift. The author felt that the comment was not only dismissive but also hypocritical, given the cousin's financial situation. \n\nHowever, the author's response involved attacking the girl's parenting skills. Even if the girl's comment was rude, the author's retaliation might have escalated the situation. The girl is 20, and the cousin is 26. The author and her husband don't have kids, which the author mentions, but does that affect the situation? Maybe not directly, but it's part of the context.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Was the girl's comment valid? Probably not; comparing gifts and implying the author isn't special is unkind. 2) Did the author have a right to respond? Maybe, but the way she did\u2014attacking parenting skills\u2014might be crossing a line. 3) The author's intent was to defend her pride and the effort she put into the gift, which is understandable, but the response was personal and could be seen as an ad hominem attack.\n\nSo, while the initial comment was rude, the author's response of attacking parenting skills (which the girl might not be responsible for, as it's the cousin's parenting) might be the author's mistake. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for overstepping and making the argument personal. But maybe not entirely, since the girl's comment was the trigger.\n\nIn terms of social norms, calling someone out for a rude comment is sometimes acceptable, but attacking someone's personal life (parenting) is more severe. The author's response might be seen as disproportionate. Hence, the author is in the wrong because she escalated the conflict by attacking the girl's parenting instead of addressing the comment directly.\n"
