I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for reacting the way she did. So, the scenario is that she bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had already bought the same for her cousin during Christmas. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch, and now the author is defending her actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author spent her entire paycheck on the gift, which she was proud of. The cousin's family had a baby recently and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet they could afford a $400 game system. The author felt slighted because the cousin's girlfriend implied her gift wasn't special. She confronted the cousin's girlfriend, who then insulted her, and now the author is trying to justify her response.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the possible angles. On one hand, the author was defending her gift and her effort, which might be seen as justified. She could feel that the cousin's girlfriend was being dismissive or envious. On the other hand, responding by calling out the other person's parenting skills might have been an overreach. Also, the comment about the cousin's girlfriend's parenting could be a personal attack, which isn't appropriate.\n\nBut wait, the author mentioned that the cousin's family had a baby and were asking for money but still bought the game. The author's comment about their parenting skills might have been pointing out the inconsistency in their financial priorities. However, making an accusation about parenting based on a purchase is a bit of a stretch. It's possible that the author's reaction was defensive and possibly crossed into personal attacks.\n\nAlso, the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend might have been a comparison, but that doesn't necessarily justify a harsh response. The author's reaction could be seen as defensive, but the way she called out the other person's parenting might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. It's possible that the author overreacted by turning the argument into a personal attack on parenting, which is a sensitive topic, especially regarding a new baby.\n\nAnother angle is that the author was defending her own actions and pride in the gift, which is understandable. However, using the parenting comment could be seen as an ad hominem attack, which is not the best way to handle a conflict. The cousin's girlfriend's initial comment might have been hurtful, but the author's response could have been more constructive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction might be seen as an overreaction. She had a right to feel upset about the comment, but responding by attacking the other person's parenting skills might be crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n\nWait, the cousin's family asked for money for diapers and formula but could afford a $400 game. The author's comment about parenting skills could be implying that they're not managing their finances responsibly, which is a judgment. Even if that's true, making that personal attack in response to a comment about the gift might be inappropriate. The author could have chosen a different way to respond, like explaining her feelings without attacking the other person's choices.\n\nTherefore, the author's response was an overreaction and an ad hominem attack, making her the one at fault. So the answer would be A.\n"
