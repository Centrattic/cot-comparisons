I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is wrong for attacking someone else in response to their Facebook comment. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game as a birthday present. She posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for her cousin on Christmas, implying that the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry because she spent her entire paycheck on this gift, and there's also a context where the cousin's family had recently asked for money for diapers and formula but could afford a $400 gaming system. The author then called the girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the girlfriend called her a bitch, and the author is now defending her actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong in her response. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so we need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction might stem from feeling her gift's value is being undermined. She spent a significant portion of her income on something her husband wanted, so she might feel proud and validated. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend could be seen as dismissive or belittling, which might trigger a defensive response. Additionally, the financial context (the other family having a baby and asking for money but purchasing an expensive gift) adds to the author's frustration, possibly leading her to question the other family's priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, responding to a comment with an attack, especially on social media, can escalate the situation. The comment might not have been intended to be malicious; it could be a simple observation or a joke. The author's immediate anger and public confrontation might have been disproportionate. Also, bringing up parenting skills (implying poor financial management) is a personal attack that could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the context.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent of the initial comment and the appropriateness of the response. If the cousin's girlfriend was just trying to point out that the same gift was given earlier, without malice, the author's response might be unwarranted. However, if the comment was clearly meant to mock or undermine, then the author's reaction could be justified as self-defense. But given the lack of malicious intent in the comment, the author's response might be the wrong approach, even if her feelings are hurt.\n\nAlso, the financial situation is a red flag. The other family's recent financial needs versus their purchase of the same gift might indicate different priorities, but the author's public criticism of their parenting could be seen as an overreach. People have different circumstances, and assuming someone else's financial decisions are wrong without knowing the full story can lead to unnecessary conflict.\n\nIn terms of social interactions, it's generally better to address such situations privately and respectfully, if at all necessary. Publicly calling someone out, especially with personal attacks, is unlikely to resolve the issue and can damage relationships. The author's choice of response might have been inappropriate, even if her feelings were hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction, while understandable given her emotions, might not be the right approach. She could have handled the situation differently, perhaps by ignoring the comment, addressing it privately, or focusing on her own actions rather than attacking the other person. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
