I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift for her husband and a comment from his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas and called the author not special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to an argument. The girl called her a bitch, and now the author is defending her actions.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author spent her hard-earned money (about $500 every two weeks) on a gift her husband wanted. The cousin's girlfriend had recently received a baby and asked for help with diapers and formula but could afford the $400 item. The author felt disrespected and called her out, which led to a confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The comment was a direct comparison that undermined the author's gift. 2) The financial sacrifice the author made. 3) The cousin's girlfriend's situation (new baby, financial struggles) vs. her ability to buy the same gift. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. People often feel defensive when someone dismisses their efforts or implies they aren't special. However, responding with a call-out, especially if it's confrontational, can escalate the situation. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was rude and possibly envious, but the author's response might have been too harsh. \n\nBut the author's motivation was defending her own effort and pride in the gift. The comment from the other person was not just a simple correction but a passive-aggressive remark. The author's financial struggle adds context to her defensiveness. \n\nHowever, even if the comment was hurtful, responding with an attack (calling her out on parenting skills) might not be the best approach. It could be seen as taking the conversation too far, especially if it's personal. The cousin's girlfriend's parenting skills weren't relevant to the initial comment, so attacking that could be considered an ad hominem.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the cousin's girlfriend was wrong first by making the comment. But the author's response might have exacerbated the situation. However, given the context of the comment and her own feelings, it's a close call. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be \"No\" because she was defending her pride and effort, even if her method was harsh. Alternatively, maybe \"Yes\" because she escalated it with an attack on parenting. \n\nBut considering the initial comment was the provocation, and the author's justification (financial sacrifice, the other's situation), it's likely that the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was the first wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
