I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman defending her birthday gift for her husband after someone else claims she's not special by saying the same gift was given as a Christmas present to her husband's cousin. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman spent her entire paycheck on the PS4 Pro and a game, which she was proud of. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The woman responded by calling her out, leading to an argument where the cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch, and now the woman is upset about being criticized for her parenting skills (since the cousin has a baby and asked for help with diapers and formula recently).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the perspectives. The woman felt her gift was personal and meaningful, especially since it was a big financial sacrifice. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might have been meant to mock the choice of gift, perhaps implying that it's common or not thoughtful. The woman's response was to call out the other person, which led to a conflict. \n\nIs the woman in the wrong? Well, responding to a snarky comment with confrontation is understandable if you feel disrespected, but it's also possible that the situation could have been handled more diplomatically. However, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was about the gift's originality, which is a sensitive topic. The woman's pride in her gift is valid, especially given the financial sacrifice. Also, the cousin's family had financial issues recently, which adds context to the woman's frustration.\n\nBut, the woman's reaction\u2014calling out the other person's parenting skills\u2014might be crossing a line. If the cousin's family was asking for help with diapers and formula, pointing that out could be seen as an attack on their financial responsibility, which is a personal and sensitive issue. The cousin's girlfriend might have overstepped, but the woman's response escalated the conflict by bringing up their parenting choices. \n\nSo, while the initial comment was hurtful, the woman's response of attacking parenting skills might have been more harmful. However, if the cousin's girlfriend was indeed implying that the gift wasn't special because they could afford it despite their recent financial struggles, the woman might feel justified in pointing that out. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the key is whether the woman had the right to respond as she did. Since the comment was about the gift's originality and the woman took it as a personal attack, her reaction might be defensible. However, bringing up the parenting aspect (which she mentions the cousin's girlfriend is now mad about) could be the point where she went too far. \n\nSo, maybe the woman is partially at fault for escalating the situation by bringing in the cousin's family's financial habits. But the initial comment was the trigger. It's a bit of both, but perhaps the woman is more in the wrong because her response involved attacking the other person's parenting, which is more personal and invasive. Alternatively, if she's pointing out the hypocrisy of the cousin's family's financial situation, that's a valid point. \n\nHmm. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A or B. Considering the dynamics, the woman was defending her pride in the gift, which is understandable. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was dismissive, and the woman's response, while perhaps harsh, was in defense of her own actions. However, bringing up the parenting and financial habits (even if true) is a personal attack. \n\nIn many cases, responding to a personal attack with another personal attack is not advisable. So, the woman's approach might be seen as wrong because she escalated the conflict by attacking the other person's parenting, which is more sensitive. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
