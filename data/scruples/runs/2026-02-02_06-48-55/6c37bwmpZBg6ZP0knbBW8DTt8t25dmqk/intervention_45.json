I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which was a significant expense. She posted about it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author then responded by calling her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and the author defended herself, possibly attacking her parenting skills since the cousin's family had a baby and asked for money for diapers and formula.\n\nSo, the main points here are about the appropriateness of the author's response. The key issue is whether the author overreacted by attacking the other person. \n\nThe other person's comment might have been a bit insensitive, but making a comment on social media about someone else's gift isn't necessarily an attack. The author's reaction, though, escalated the situation by calling out the other person's parenting skills. That part is where the conflict probably intensified. \n\nThe author's justification is that she worked hard for her money and was proud of the gift. However, responding aggressively in public (calling someone a bitch and attacking their parenting) seems excessive. Even if the comment was rude, there are more constructive ways to handle it. Public shaming or bringing up personal matters like parenting skills can be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, considering the age difference\u2014author is 24, the other person is 20\u2014but the husband is 26. The fact that the author has no children might not matter, but it's part of the context. The main issue is the reaction to a social media comment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was probably unkind, but the author's response was more harmful. Publicly attacking someone's parenting, especially in a defensive or aggressive way, is usually not appropriate. It's possible that the author's reaction was a result of feeling disrespected, but the method of response is what's being questioned here.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because her response was disproportionate and unkind, even if the other person's comment was rude. However, some might argue that the other person's comment was the root problem. But generally, how you respond matters more in determining fault.\n"
