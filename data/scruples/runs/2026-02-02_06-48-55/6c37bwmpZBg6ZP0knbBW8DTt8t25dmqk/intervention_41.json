I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a gift for her husband and a Facebook comment from his cousin's girlfriend.\n\nSo, the author sent a gift to her husband, a PS4 Pro and a game. She posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for her cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author got angry because she spent her entire paycheck on the gift and felt disrespected. She called the other person out, and now there's some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intentions. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was probably meant to diminish the significance of the author's gift. That's pretty rude. People often compare gifts, but it's not nice. The author might have felt her effort and sacrifice were being undermined. She spent a lot of money, which is a big deal, and her husband had wanted the PS4 for years. The other person had a baby and was asking for money, yet could afford a $400 gift. That adds to the frustration.\n\nBut then the author responded by calling out the other person, and the cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch. The author is now worried about being wrong for defending herself. The cousin's girlfriend might have overreacted, but was the author's response appropriate? If she attacked the other person's parenting skills, that's a different issue. Maybe she brought up the fact that the other person had a baby and couldn't afford diapers but could afford a game. That could be crossing a line, even if the initial comment was rude.\n\nIn conflicts, it's important to address the behavior without personal attacks. The author might have felt justified, but attacking parenting skills might be a form of ad hominem. However, the cousin's girlfriend started by belittling her gift. The author's reaction could be seen as self-defense, but maybe she could have handled it more calmly. \n\nAlso, social media interactions can escalate quickly. Posting a gift and then someone commenting can lead to public shaming. The author might have taken it personally and responded in the moment. The question is whether her response was proportionate. She was trying to assert her own value, which is understandable, but the way she did it might have been harsh.\n\nOn one hand, the cousin's girlfriend made a thoughtless comment. On the other, the author's retaliation might have been more hurtful. So, who's at fault here? The initial comment was rude, but the response might have been equally inappropriate. If the author attacked the other's parenting, that's a personal attack beyond the original issue. So maybe the author is in the wrong for escalating it. But some people might argue she was defending her own actions. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the personal attack, even if the initial comment was bad.\n"
