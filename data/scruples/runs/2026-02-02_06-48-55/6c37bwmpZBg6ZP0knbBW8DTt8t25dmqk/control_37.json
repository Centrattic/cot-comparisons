I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting someone who criticized their gift. So the situation is that the author bought a PS4 Pro for her husband's birthday, posted a picture on Facebook, and a cousin's girlfriend commented that she had already bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She spent her entire paycheck on a gift her husband wanted, and she was proud of it. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend could be seen as dismissive and possibly envious, given that the other family was asking for money for a baby's needs but could afford a $400 game. The author might feel that the comment was unfair, especially considering their financial situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend might have felt that the author was showing off by posting the gift, so she tried to put her down. But responding with \"you're not special\" could be a way of trying to assert that her own gift was the original or more significant. However, the author's reaction was to call her out, perhaps on her parenting skills, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent of the comment, the author's response, and whether the response was justified. The author's main points are about the effort and sacrifice she made for the gift, and the other person's financial situation. The author's defense was about her own financial sacrifice, which might be a valid point. However, the way she called out the other person's parenting could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the original comment wasn't about parenting. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author has no children might be relevant here. If she criticized parenting skills, that could be irrelevant to the original issue and thus inconsiderate. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was about the gift's originality, not parenting. So the author's response might have been a personal attack, which is not appropriate. \n\nBut the author might argue that the comment about the gift was a way of belittling her effort and that she was defending her own actions. However, escalating to personal attacks (like parenting) isn't the best approach. The initial comment was hurtful, but responding in a way that brings up unrelated topics (parenting) could be seen as the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because she took the situation personally, allowed it to escalate into an argument with personal jabs, and didn't handle it more calmly. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, but the author's response was also unproductive and could have been handled better. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
