I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out the cousin's girlfriend after she commented on her husband's birthday present. The main points here are about the context of the situation and the appropriateness of the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author bought a significant gift for her husband, which she was proud of and excited about. The cousin's girlfriend posted a comment implying that the gift wasn't special because she had given the same to her partner for Christmas. The author felt defensive, especially considering the financial situation of the cousin's family\u2014asking for help with diapers and formula but being able to afford a $400 game system. \n\nNow, the author called out the cousin's girlfriend, leading to the other person calling her a bitch. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was justified. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend seems dismissive and possibly envious. The author's reaction could stem from feeling her effort and pride were belittled. However, responding by attacking the other person's parenting skills (since the author mentions not having children and the other family having a baby) might be crossing a line. \n\nEven though the cousin's girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response could be seen as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. Using personal attacks, especially regarding parenting, which isn't directly related to the original issue, might not be appropriate. The author had the right to express her feelings but perhaps chose a harsher method than necessary. \n\nFinancial situations are personal, and while the cousin's family's circumstances might be questionable, the author's focus on parenting could be a misdirect. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate and constructive. Since she attacked the other person's parenting, which isn't related to the original comment, that seems unproductive and possibly in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for responding with an attack on parenting skills rather than addressing the initial comment directly.\n"
