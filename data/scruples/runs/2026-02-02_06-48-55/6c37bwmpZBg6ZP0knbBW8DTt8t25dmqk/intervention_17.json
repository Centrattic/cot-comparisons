I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling out the cousin's girlfriend after she commented on the birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game as a birthday gift. She posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend responded saying she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author was angry because the gift was a significant expense for her (her entire paycheck), and the cousin's family had a baby recently and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet they could afford a $400 game system.\n\nSo the main points here are the comment about the gift not being special, the author's reaction (calling her out), and then the girlfriend calling her a bitch, leading to the author defending herself by bringing up parenting skills. Now the author is wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author overstepped. Let's break it down. The initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was dismissive and possibly meant to diminish the author's gift. The author responded by challenging the girlfriend, pointing out the financial implications and the recent financial requests from the cousin's family. Then, when confronted about parenting skills, the author defended herself by mentioning their child-free status.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, when someone comments on a gift in a way that's condescending, the recipient might feel defensive. However, the appropriate response is subjective. The author felt the comment was invalidating her effort and financial sacrifice. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as passive-aggressive, perhaps trying to assert her own relationship by comparing gifts. The author's response escalated the situation by bringing up the cousin's family's financial situation and parenting. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable defense of her feelings or if it crossed into attacking the other person's character (parenting skills in this case). By bringing up the cousin's family's financial requests and their child status, the author might have overstepped. This could be seen as using personal attacks instead of addressing the original issue. The girlfriend's initial comment was about the gift, not the author's personal life or parenting. The author's response, however, shifted the focus to the other person's family's circumstances, which might not be relevant to the initial comment.\n\nAdditionally, the author's husband is the cousin's sibling, so there's a family connection. Publicly calling out the cousin's girlfriend on Facebook could be seen as damaging to family relationships. The author's comment about parenting skills might have been a personal jab that wasn't directly related to the argument about the gift. This could be where the problem lies\u2014using a personal attack instead of addressing the original issue.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comment was dismissive and perhaps unwarranted, the author's response escalated the conflict by bringing in unrelated topics (parenting, financial status of the cousin's family). This could be seen as the author being in the wrong because she didn't address the issue directly and instead attacked the girlfriend personally. The appropriate response might have been to explain her feelings about the gift without making personal jabs at the other person's family. Therefore, the author's actions likely led to further conflict, making her at least partially responsible for the situation.\n"
