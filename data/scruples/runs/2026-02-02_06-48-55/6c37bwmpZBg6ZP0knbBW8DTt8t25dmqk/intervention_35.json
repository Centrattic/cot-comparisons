I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Facebook comment where someone else claimed a gift for the author's husband was already given by a cousin's girlfriend. The author responded angrily, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author bought a significant gift (PS4 Pro and game) for her husband. She posted about it, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had given the same to her cousin. The author felt disrespected, especially considering financial circumstances and the other family's recent baby and requests for help. She called the girl out, they got into an argument, and now the girl is upset.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The author's reaction is understandable. She invested her hard-earned money into a gift her husband wanted, and someone else's comment undermined her effort. The cousin's girlfriend might have intended to compliment but came across as dismissive. However, the author's response was to \"attack\" the girl, which escalated the situation. The girl called her a bitch, but the author continued by attacking her parenting skills, which is more serious. \n\nThe financial context is important. The author is on a tight budget, which makes the gift significant to her. The cousin's girlfriend's family had a baby recently and was asking for money, which might imply they weren't in a position to spend on such gifts, yet she spent $400. The author's frustration here is valid, but attacking the girl's parenting skills seems out of bounds. \n\nIn conflicts, responding with personal attacks, even if you feel justified, is usually not the best approach. The author had a right to feel disrespected, but the way she handled it by bringing up parenting skills might have crossed a line. The original comment could have been a misunderstanding or a harsh way of saying the gift was nice but already given. The author could have clarified or defended her gift without attacking the other person's parenting. \n\nSo, while the initial comment was hurtful, the author's escalation into a personal attack on parenting skills is where she goes wrong. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
