I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game for his birthday. She posted it on Facebook, and his cousin's girlfriend commented that she had already bought the cousin the same thing for Christmas, implying that the author's gift wasn't special. The author got mad, called the girl out, leading to an argument where the girl called her a bitch. The author is wondering if she was right to respond the way she did.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she gave for being upset. She mentions that the gift cost her her entire biweekly paycheck, which was $500. She was proud of the gift because her husband wanted it for years. Also, the cousin's family had just had a baby and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet they could afford a $400 game system. She took offense to the comment and called the girl out, which escalated the situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The cousin's girlfriend made a comment that seems dismissive and possibly condescending. She might have intended to belittle the author's gift, perhaps out of jealousy or a desire to boast that her own gift was given earlier. The author's reaction was to defend her gift and her pride in it. \n\nBut how did she respond? The original post says she \"called her out,\" which could have been a confrontational or aggressive response. The girl then called her a bitch, which is a derogatory term. The author might have escalated the conflict by responding in a way that was also confrontational. \n\nThe key here is how the author responded. If she attacked the girl back, maybe even insulted her parenting skills (as mentioned in the last sentence), that would be a problem. The girl's comment was about the gift, but the author's response shifted to the girl's parenting, which is a personal attack. That's probably where things went wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's argument about the cousin's family being able to afford the gift when they were struggling with baby expenses is a valid point, but bringing that into the argument might have been personal and not directly related to the initial comment. By attacking the girl's parenting skills, the author might have overstepped. \n\nSo, the initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was rude, but the author's response went beyond defending her gift to attacking the person, which is not appropriate. Even if the girl was wrong in her comment, responding with a personal attack isn't the right way to handle it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she escalated the conflict with a personal attack instead of addressing the issue calmly.\n"
