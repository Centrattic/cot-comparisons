I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by responding to a comment from their husband's cousin's girlfriend. The situation involves a gift and some social media comments.\n\nFirst, the user bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented saying she bought the same thing for her partner at Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The user got angry and called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch, and now the user is defending herself by pointing out the other person's financial situation (they had a baby recently and were asking for money but could afford the $400 gift).\n\nThe user is wondering if she's at fault. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was probably meant as a jab, maybe to belittle the user's gift. The user responded in anger. But was her response justified? She mentions the financial aspect, which might be a valid point\u2014it's possible the other person couldn't afford the gift if they were asking for money for diapers and formula. However, the user's response led to a conflict where the other person was defensive, maybe even using parenting as a point. \n\nBut the user's main issue was feeling disrespected. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was about the gift not being special because someone else had given the same thing. The user felt attacked and retaliated. The question is whether her response was in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of social media interactions, sometimes people make comments they don't expect to be taken personally. If the user's response was confrontational, she might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. However, the other person made a comment that could be seen as rude or passive-aggressive. \n\nThe user's defense about her financial situation (sacrificing her paycheck) is a valid point. But responding with anger and calling her out might not have been the best approach. Maybe she could have addressed it calmly instead of getting defensive. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the cousin's girlfriend's comment was inconsiderate, the user's response (calling her out and maybe attacking her parenting) might have been the wrong move. It's possible that the user overreacted, leading to a worse situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A, that the user is in the wrong for responding aggressively, even if she felt wronged. It's about how you handle conflicts, and sometimes the best approach is to not engage in public arguments. The user's actions might have been defensive but still unhelpful.\n"
