He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game for his birthday. She posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas and said the author isn't special. The author got upset and called her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch. Now, the author is wondering if she was right to respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the gift cost her her entire paycheck, which was $500 every two weeks. That's a significant amount, especially if it's her full paycheck. She was proud of the gift and excited for her husband, who had wanted it for years. On the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend had a baby in November and was asking for money for diapers and formula just two weeks before, yet they had enough for a $400 game system. \n\nThe author responded to the comment, which led to the other person being defensive and calling her a bitch. The author is now questioning if she was in the wrong. \n\nFrom what I can see, the cousin's girlfriend's comment seems dismissive and possibly envious. She's implying that the author's gift wasn't special because someone else gave the same thing earlier. However, the context of the other family's financial situation (new baby, asking for money) versus the author's sacrifice (using her entire paycheck) adds another layer. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call out the other person, perhaps pointing out the contradiction in their financial claims. It's possible that the author felt disrespected and that the other person was being hypocritical. However, responding in a confrontational way might have escalated the situation. \n\nBut considering that the initial comment was a personal attack on the author's gift and her pride in it, the author might have felt justified in defending her actions. The key here is whether the response was proportionate. The author's defense might have included pointing out the other family's financial situation, which could be seen as attacking their parenting or financial decisions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author responded in a way that was confrontational or harsh, that might not have been the best approach. But if she simply explained her perspective and the other person was defensive, then maybe the other person escalated it further. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the situation, the author's initial reaction was to defend her gift and her pride, which is understandable. The other person made a dismissive comment, so the author might have felt the need to respond. However, the way she called out the parenting skills might have been inappropriate. If she went beyond responding to the comment and attacked the other person's parenting, that's where she might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, if the author's response was about the other family's financial situation and parenting, that could be seen as crossing the line. But if she just defended her own actions without attacking back, maybe not. The original comment was about the gift, not parenting. So by bringing up their parenting (like having a baby and still buying the game), the author might have escalated the conflict. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she responded with an attack on parenting, which was not part of the original comment. However, if she only defended her own situation without personal attacks, she might not be. The description says she called out her parenting skills, which implies she went beyond the original issue, making her at fault.\n"
