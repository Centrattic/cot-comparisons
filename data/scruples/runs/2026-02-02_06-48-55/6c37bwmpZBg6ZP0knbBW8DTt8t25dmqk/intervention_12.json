I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for attacking someone who criticized their husband's birthday gift. The situation is that the author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which cost her entire paycheck. She posted a picture on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author then called out the cousin's girlfriend, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was proud of her gift, which was a significant expense for her. The cousin's girlfriend made a comment that the author found disrespectful, possibly because it belittled her effort and financial sacrifice. The author responded by calling out the cousin's ability to afford the gift, especially since the cousin had a baby and was asking for money for diapers and formula. The cousin's girlfriend then became defensive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was passive-aggressive and could be seen as undermining the author's gesture. People often take offense when someone else diminishes their personal achievements or gifts. However, the author's response may have escalated the situation. Instead of confronting the cousin's girlfriend about the comment, she criticized the other person's financial decisions and parenting, which might be a personal attack rather than a direct response to the original comment.\n\nThe cousin's girlfriend's comment was a public slight, which can be hurtful. However, retaliating by attacking someone's parenting or financial habits is not a proportionate response. The author's actions could be seen as defending her pride in the gift but in a way that invaded the other person's privacy or judgment of their life choices. The fact that the cousin's family might have financial struggles is irrelevant if they could afford the gift. The author's response, while understandable in frustration, may have crossed into personal criticism, which is often considered inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the context of the cousins' situation (new baby, asking for help) adds another layer. The author might have felt targeted because of the other family's financial situation, but bringing that up in the confrontation could be seen as using that as a weapon, which is not helpful. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was about the gift, not about the author's financial status or her family's circumstances. By shifting the focus to the other family's ability to afford the gift, the author might have overstepped.\n\nIn summary, while the cousin's girlfriend made a hurtful comment, the author's response was a personal attack rather than addressing the original issue. Public comments can be irritating, but responding with personal criticism is likely to escalate conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how she handled the situation.\n"
