I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: the wife bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game for his birthday. She posted pictures on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The wife got angry, called the girl out, and got into an argument where the girl called her a bitch. Now the wife is wondering if she was right to respond that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife mentions that the gift cost her her entire paycheck, which she works hard for. She was proud of the gift because her husband wanted it for years. The cousin's family had a baby recently and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet could afford a $400 system. That seems contradictory, which might fuel the wife's frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was hurtful, but was it justified? The wife is defensive because the comment made her feel her gift wasn't special. However, responding by calling her out might have escalated the situation. The question is whether the wife's response was appropriate.\n\nThe wife's argument is that the gift was important to her husband and herself, and she was proud of it. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was dismissive, but the wife's response involved attacking the girl's parenting skills, which might be crossing a line. Also, the girl called her a bitch, which is rude, but did the wife have the right to retaliate?\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone makes a passive-aggressive comment about your gift, it's understandable to feel defensive. However, responding with an attack on someone else's character (parenting skills) might be seen as the wrong approach. The wife's intent was to defend her gift's value, but the method could be problematic.\n\nThe wife's financial situation adds context\u2014she used her entire paycheck, which is a significant sacrifice. The cousin's family's financial situation seems contradictory, but that's their own matter. The wife's right to be proud of her gift is valid, but the way she confronted the cousin's girlfriend might not be the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nConsidering all this, the wife might be in the wrong because she escalated the conflict by attacking the girl's parenting, which is a personal attack and not directly related to the comment about the gift. While the comment was rude, the response was more aggressive and crossed into personal territory. So the answer would lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
