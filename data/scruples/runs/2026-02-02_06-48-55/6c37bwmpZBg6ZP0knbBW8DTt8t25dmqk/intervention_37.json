I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for reacting to a comment from her husband's cousin's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which was a significant expense (costing her entire biweekly paycheck). She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying the gift wasn't special. The author got angry and called her out, leading to the girl calling her a bitch. Now the author is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nMy analysis: The key points here are about the appropriateness of the response. The cousin's girlfriend made a snide comment, which could be seen as dismissive or condescending. The author's reaction was to confront her, which escalated the situation. The girl then called her a bitch, and the author continues to defend her actions by pointing out the financial sacrifice and the other family's recent financial struggles.\n\nThe main issue is whether the initial comment was worthy of such a strong reaction. The comment could be interpreted as a backhanded compliment, trying to diminish the effort the author put into the gift. However, publicly confronting someone in response, especially on social media, might come off as aggressive, even if the comment was hurtful. The author's response might have been defensive and possibly crossed into personal attacks, especially if she criticized the girl's parenting (since the girl has a baby). \n\nThe author's justification about the financial aspect is valid, but the way she handled the situation might not be. Responding with hostility rather than addressing the issue calmly could be seen as inconsiderate. The girl's comment was rude, but the author's reaction escalated the conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the author's response was proportional to the comment, maybe not. But if she attacked the girl's parenting or made it personal beyond the initial comment, then yes. The question is whether the author's actions were justified in response to a snide comment. Some might argue that defending one's pride in a personal gift is valid, but the method of response (attacking back) might be problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because responding with aggression and attacking the girl's parenting might be seen as overstepping, even if the comment was hurtful. However, others might side with the author, thinking the comment was unfair and the response was justified. But in terms of general social norms, public shaming or personal attacks are usually frowned upon. So leaning towards A.\n"
