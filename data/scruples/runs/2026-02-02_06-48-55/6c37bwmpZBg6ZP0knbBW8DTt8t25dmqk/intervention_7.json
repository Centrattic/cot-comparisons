I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman who bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game as a birthday present. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying the author isn't special. The author got angry and called the girl out, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was proud of the gift, which cost her a significant amount (half her paycheck). The cousin's family had a baby recently and asked for money for diapers and formula but could afford a $400 gift. The author confronted the girl, who then insulted her. Now the author is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. The possible answers are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author was defending her pride in the gift and possibly feeling disrespected. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend might have come off as dismissive or condescending. The author had every right to feel upset about her investment and the implication that her gift wasn't meaningful. Also, the cousin's family's financial situation could be a point\u2014using a baby's expenses to ask for money but spending on a console might seem inconsistent.\n\nOn the other hand, responding by calling out the girl's parenting skills might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Instead of engaging in a public confrontation, maybe a private message to address the issue could have been more appropriate. The author's reaction might have been defensive and aggressive, which could be seen as the wrong approach even if the initial comment was hurtful.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The cousin's girlfriend made a comment that the author found offensive. However, the way the author responded by attacking the girl's parenting might have crossed a line. Even if the girl's comment was rude, responding in a way that accuses her of poor parenting could be seen as an overreaction and an invasion of privacy or judgment of someone else's choices.\n\nAlso, the fact that the girl is 20 and the cousin is 26 doesn't necessarily relate to parenting skills unless the author was implying that having a baby so young is irresponsible. That could be a sensitive topic, and bringing it up might not be fair. The author might have felt justified due to the financial inconsistency, but attacking the girl's parenting is a personal attack rather than addressing the initial comment.\n\nIn conflict resolution, it's often advised to address the issue without personal attacks. So, while the initial comment was hurtful, the author's response of calling out the girl's parenting is likely the issue here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of the aggressive and personal nature of the retaliation.\n"
