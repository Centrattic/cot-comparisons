I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband's birthday present. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which was a significant investment. She posted a photo of the gift on Facebook, and a cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the author's gift isn't special.\n\nThe author got angry, called the girl out, and the girl responded with an insult. Now the author is confused about whether she was right to defend her gift. The key points here are: the financial sacrifice (the gift cost her entire paycheck), the fact that the other couple had a baby and were asking for money for diapers and formula but could afford a $400 gift, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reaction was justified. The girl's comment was probably meant to belittle the gift, but the author's response was defensive. The author points out the financial aspect and the other couple's situation as reasons for her anger. However, the author's approach was to \"call out\" the girl, which led to an argument.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girl's comment was unkind, but the author's response might have been aggressive. People often react emotionally when their efforts are dismissed, but publicly confronting someone in a way that escalates the conflict could be seen as wrong. The author's justification about the financial sacrifice and the other couple's situation is valid, but the method of response might not be appropriate. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the girl is 20, and the author is 24, which might mean the girl is less experienced. However, that's not a direct factor in judging right or wrong. The core issue is whether the author was justified in attacking the girl's parenting skills. The author might have overstepped by bringing up the couple's financial situation and parenting, which could be a personal attack.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because reacting with an attack, even if provoked, isn't the most constructive or respectful approach. However, the girl's comment was also inconsiderate. The author's right to feel proud of her gift is valid, but the way she handled it might not be. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though her feelings are valid, her response was offensive.\n"
