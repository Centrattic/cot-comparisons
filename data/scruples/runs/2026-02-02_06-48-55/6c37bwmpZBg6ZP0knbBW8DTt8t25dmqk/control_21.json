I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's husband's cousin's girlfriend commented on their Facebook post about a gift, implying it wasn't special because she had bought the same for her cousin at Christmas. The author got defensive, called her out, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. They spent their entire paycheck on a gift their husband had wanted for years. They were proud of it. The comment from the cousin's girlfriend made them feel like their gift wasn't special, which hurt their feelings. The author might feel that the comment was dismissive and maybe even a bit snarky, especially considering the other family had financial struggles but still bought the same expensive item. The author's response was to call her out, leading to the other person being upset.\n\nFrom the cousin's girlfriend's side, she might have made a casual comment, thinking it was harmless. She didn't intend to belittle the author's gift, maybe just pointing out that someone else had given the same thing. However, the context of the author's financial situation and the previous requests for help adds layers. The author might feel it's hypocritical for someone who needed financial help to spend on a pricey gift.\n\nNow, evaluating right and wrong. The key points are intent and proportionality. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could be seen as thoughtless or inconsiderate, especially if it was meant to diminish the author's effort. However, the author's response of \"calling out her parenting skills\" (since she's 20 and has a baby) seems aggressive and possibly personal. Even if the comment was hurtful, responding with an attack on her parenting might escalate the conflict unnecessarily. The author might have had a right to feel upset but could have chosen a more constructive response. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified. If the author's response was disproportionate or personal, then they might be in the wrong. However, if they were defending their feelings and the effort they put into the gift, maybe not. The key is if they crossed the line into personal attacks. Since the response involved attacking parenting skills, which isn't directly related to the comment about the gift, that seems like an overreaction. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the initial comment was inconsiderate, so the author's response, while perhaps not ideal, was a reaction to being slighted. But attacking parenting is a separate issue. So the author might be in the wrong for escalating it. Hmm. I think the answer is A because even if the other person's comment was hurtful, responding by attacking her parenting is crossing a line.\n"
