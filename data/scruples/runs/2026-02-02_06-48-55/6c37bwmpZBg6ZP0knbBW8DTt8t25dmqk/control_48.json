I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out the cousin's girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted pictures on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her partner (the cousin) on Christmas and said the author isn't special. The author was upset because the gift cost her her entire paycheck, and she felt proud of the gift. Plus, the couple had a baby not long ago and were asking for money for diapers and formula, so the author questioned how they could afford a $400 gift. She called the girl out, got called a bitch, and now the girl is mad about the author's comments on her parenting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author's reaction to the comment: the cousin's girlfriend compared the author's gift to her own. The author felt her gift was significant because it was a big expense for her, and she was proud. The cousin's family's financial situation is questionable since they had a baby and needed money for diapers, yet they bought a similar gift. The author's response included calling her out, which led to the argument.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are about comparing gifts and the appropriateness of the response. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was likely meant to diminish the author's effort by implying that the gift wasn't special because someone else had given the same. The author's reaction was defensive, pointing out the financial sacrifice and questioning the other's ability to afford the gift given their recent financial struggles. The cousin's girlfriend then escalated by calling the author a bitch, and the author continued by criticizing her parenting, which led to the girl being upset about that.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, when someone makes a derogatory comment about another's gift, the appropriate response is usually to ignore or politely address it. The author's initial reaction was to confront the comment, which is understandable given the emotional value she attached to the gift. However, bringing up the cousin's family's financial situation and their request for money could be seen as attacking them personally, especially in a public forum like Facebook. The author then further escalated by commenting on the girl's parenting, which is a sensitive topic and can be considered personal and harsh.\n\nWhether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of the confrontation. While the cousin's girlfriend made a hurtful comment, the author's response went beyond just defending her gift. By pointing out the financial aspect and the family's requests, she may be perceived as attacking the other person's character and financial decisions. Additionally, commenting on parenting skills is a sensitive area and could be seen as crossing a line, even if the author felt justified.\n\nThe key here is the proportionality of the response. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was a personal jab, but the author's response was more than just a rebuttal; it was a personal attack. Even if the author felt justified, the way she responded might be considered too harsh. The author's actions led to further conflict, which suggests that her response may not have been the best approach. However, there's also the aspect of defending one's own feelings and the value of her gift, which is understandable.\n\nIn summary, while the cousin's girlfriend made a hurtful comment, the author's response escalated the situation by making personal attacks about finances and parenting. This escalation might be considered in the wrong because it's a public confrontation and targeting sensitive areas like parenting can be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The user's situation is that she was proud of her gift and felt disrespected. However, the way she responded might have been overly aggressive. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
