I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over a birthday gift. The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, posted pictures on Facebook, and received a comment from his cousin's girlfriend saying she bought that for the cousin on Christmas and implying that the author isn't special. The author responded by calling her out, leading to an argument where the other person called her a bitch and the author then criticized her parenting skills.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is angry because the gift cost her a significant portion of her income and she was proud of it. The cousin's girlfriend commented on the post, which led to the author defending her gift and possibly attacking the other's parenting. The issue here is whether the author's response was justified.\n\nThe cousin's girlfriend made a comment that could be seen as dismissive or belittling of the author's gift. The author felt this was unfair, especially considering her own financial situation and the other person's recent financial requests. However, the author's response escalated the situation by attacking the other person's parenting skills, which is a personal attack and might not be appropriate. \n\nThe cousin's girlfriend might have overstepped by making a comment intended to undermine the author's gift, but the author's response of calling her out and bringing up parenting could be seen as crossing a line. The author might be reacting out of defensiveness, but attacking someone's parenting is a serious accusation and could be hurtful. \n\nIt's important to consider intent and proportionality. The cousin's girlfriend's comment might have been meant to imply that the author's gift wasn't unique or special, but the author's response went beyond defending her gift and into personal attacks. Even if the author felt wronged, responding with an accusation about parenting might not be the right approach. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the cousin's family had recently asked for money for diapers and formula, which might have influenced her reaction. However, using that as a basis for attacking the cousin's girlfriend's parenting could be seen as irrelevant and possibly condescending. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable to feel upset about someone belittling your gift, responding with a personal attack is generally considered inappropriate. The author might have the right to feel upset but the way she responded could be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the cousin's girlfriend made a comment that could be considered snide, but the author's response was an attack on personal aspects unrelated to the initial comment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict with a personal attack.\n"
