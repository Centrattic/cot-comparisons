I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for attacking the girl who commented on her husband's birthday gift.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game, which she was proud of since it cost her her entire paycheck. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry, called her out, and the girl called her a bitch. Now the author is defending her actions, pointing out that the other family had a baby and were asking for money for diapers but could afford the $400 gift. She's also upset that the other person is mad about her \"parenting skills,\" though the author doesn't have kids.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to respond aggressively. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author felt disrespected because someone else taking credit for a similar gift made her feel like her effort wasn't recognized. She invested a lot of her paycheck into this gift, and it's understandable that she'd feel defensive. The other family's financial situation is also a factor\u2014needing money for diapers but affording a $400 item might seem contradictory, which could add to the author's frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend's comment was probably just a casual remark, not an intentional slight. The author's response escalated the situation by attacking the other person, maybe even bringing up parenting issues, which is out of line. Criticizing someone's parenting when you don't have kids yourself could be seen as hypocritical or unnecessary. Also, publicly calling someone out might not have been the best approach. Even if the author felt wronged, responding with aggression can make things worse and might come across as rude or confrontational.\n\nAnother angle: the comment about the cousin's girlfriend might have been meant to inform that the cousin received the same gift earlier, not necessarily to belittle the author's gift. The author's reaction could be seen as overreacting to a comment that wasn't intended to be an insult. Plus, bringing up the financial situation of the other family could be seen as an ad hominem attack, which isn't productive.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people do sometimes make similar gifts for different people. It's possible the cousin's girlfriend didn't realize the impact of her comment. The author's response, however, might have been more hurtful than warranted. The part about parenting skills is especially problematic because it introduces an unrelated issue and could be perceived as an insult on multiple levels.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author had valid feelings about the gift, her reaction was inappropriate. She could have addressed the situation in a calmer manner, perhaps by explaining her feelings without attacking the other person. The escalation and the personal attacks likely made the situation worse, so she might be in the wrong.\n"
