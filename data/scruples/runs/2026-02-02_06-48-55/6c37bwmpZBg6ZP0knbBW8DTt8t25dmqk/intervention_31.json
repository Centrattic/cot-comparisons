I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict over gifts between the writer and her husband's cousin's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the writer bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband, which cost her an entire paycheck. She posted a picture of the gift on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas and accused the writer of not being special. The writer was upset because the other family had a newborn and were asking for money for diapers and formula, yet they could afford the $400 gift. She responded by calling the girlfriend out, leading to an argument where the girlfriend called her a bitch and the writer ended up criticizing the girlfriend's parenting skills.\n\nNow, to determine if the writer is in the wrong. The main points to consider are: \n\n1. **The initial comment**: The cousin's girlfriend made a snarky comment, which could be seen as rude or dismissive. The writer felt disrespected because she was proud of her gift and invested a lot in it. However, the girlfriend's comment was a direct response to the writer's post, maybe trying to one-up her or mock her generosity.\n\n2. **The writer's response**: The writer took offense and called the girlfriend out. The girlfriend then escalated the situation by calling her a bitch. The writer further escalated by attacking the girlfriend's parenting skills, which is a sensitive topic, especially since the girlfriend is young and has a newborn. \n\n3. **Context and motivations**: The writer's frustration is understandable given her financial sacrifice and pride in the gift. However, responding by attacking the other person's parenting might have been an overreaction. The girlfriend's comment was about the gift, not about parenting, so the writer's response shifted the argument to a different issue, which could be seen as unfair.\n\n4. **Intent vs. Impact**: The girlfriend's initial comment was hurtful, but the writer's response was also aggressive. The key here is whether the writer's reaction was proportionate. Insulting parenting skills is a personal attack and likely caused more harm than necessary. \n\n5. **Social dynamics**: The writer has no children, and the girlfriend is 20 with a newborn. The writer's comment about parenting skills might have been insensitive given the girlfriend's age and the challenges of being a new parent. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, responding with a personal attack on parenting is typically not well-received. People often expect a more measured response to avoid further conflict. The writer's action escalated the situation unnecessarily, leading to more hostility.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the writer might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict with a personal attack. Even if the girlfriend started it, the writer's response was not appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
