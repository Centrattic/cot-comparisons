But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out the girl who commented on her Facebook post about a birthday gift for her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's 26th birthday. She posted pictures on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the author isn't special. The author got angry because the cousins had a baby recently and were asking for money for diapers/formula, yet they could afford a $400 game system. She called the girl out, the girl called her a bitch, and now the author is questioning if she was right.\n\nI need to evaluate the key points here. The author's actions were in response to a public comment that made her feel disrespected. The girl's comment was dismissive and possibly snide. The author had reasons to be upset: financial sacrifice (spending her entire paycheck), the timing given the cousins' recent financial requests, and the personal significance of the gift. \n\nThe girl's response to the author's call-out was to call her a bitch, which is aggressive. The author's initial reaction was to defend her actions, possibly in the public comments or via private message. Now the girl is upset about the author's response, which the author is defending as a reaction to feeling attacked.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone publicly belittles another person's effort or gift, the recipient might feel justified in defending their actions. However, the method of response matters. The author's choice to \"call out\" the girl in public (or even privately) could be seen as confrontational, especially if it was done in the same public forum. It's possible the author escalated the situation by not addressing it privately first, which might have been a more diplomatic approach. \n\nAlso, the girl's comment about the author not being special because she bought the same item on Christmas could be seen as a petty or unnecessary jab. The author's pride in her purchase and the financial sacrifice adds context to why the comment was hurtful. However, responding with anger might not be the best approach. \n\nConsidering that the girl called the author a bitch, the author's initial reaction might have been defensive, but the follow-up in calling out parenting skills (if that's what \"parenting skills\" refers to, maybe implying she shouldn't have the money for the gift given their baby's needs) could be seen as an attack on the girl's priorities, which might be crossing a line. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the intent, the proportionality of the response, and the context. The author had valid reasons to feel disrespected, but her response might have been aggressive. However, given the context of the initial snide comment, defending oneself isn't inherently wrong. \n\nIn terms of social norms, responding publicly can be seen as inappropriate, but if the author's response was a direct reply to a public comment, that's common. However, escalating to a personal attack (parenting skills) might be overstepping. But the girl's initial comment was also a personal jab. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's response was proportionate. If she simply called the girl out for the comment without attacking her parenting, maybe it's a B (not in the wrong). But if she made a personal attack in her response, that could be a problem. The original question mentions that the author called her out, and the girl called her a bitch, leading to the girl being mad about the author's call-out. The author might have felt justified, but the method could have been better. However, the girl's initial comment was the root of the problem. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions were a reaction to a public insult that undermined her effort. While the response might have been harsh, especially if she attacked the girl's parenting (which could be a personal attack), the initial comment from the girl was the catalyst. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author had reasons to defend her actions, especially given the context of the financial sacrifice and the girl's dismissive comment. However, the method of response could be criticized. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the root issue was the girl's comment, so the author's reaction is defensible.\n"
