I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong after confronting someone who commented on her gift for her husband.\n\nFirst, the situation: She bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday and posted about it on Facebook. The cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same thing for her partner at Christmas, implying the author's gift wasn't special. The author got angry, called the cousin's girlfriend out, and they had a back-and-forth where the other person called her a bitch and is now upset with her.\n\nThe author's reasoning: She spent her entire paycheck on the gift, was proud of it since her husband wanted it for years, and found it ironic that the other couple, who had a baby recently and were asking for money, could afford the $400 game system. She felt justified in confronting her because of the financial situation and the other person's parenting (implying they might not be responsible with money if they're asking for diapers and formula but buying expensive gifts).\n\nNow, analyzing if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about the nature of the conflict. The initial comment from the cousin's girlfriend was a passive-aggressive remark trying to diminish the author's gift by saying she did the same. The author's response was to \"call her out,\" which escalated the situation. The cousin's girlfriend then called her a bitch, leading to more conflict.\n\nIn social dynamics, when someone makes a disparaging comment, the person being targeted might feel the need to defend themselves. However, the way the author addressed the issue might have been confrontational. Public shaming or calling out someone's behavior in a situation like this, especially on social media, can be seen as inappropriate. The author might have overreacted by bringing up the other couple's financial situation (diapers and formula) as a jab, which could be seen as attacking their parenting choices. That could be crossing a line, as it's unrelated to the original comment and introduces a personal attack.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was dismissive and could be considered rude. The author might have felt disrespected and wanted to assert her own pride in the gift. However, the method of response\u2014public confrontation and bringing up unrelated financial issues\u2014might have been the wrong approach. Instead of defending her gift, she attacked the other person's parenting, which could be seen as in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was justified. While the initial comment was unkind, the author's reaction escalated the conflict and introduced personal attacks. In such situations, it's often better to address the issue privately or not at all, rather than engaging in a public argument that can turn personal and hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for how she handled the situation, even if the other person's comment was inappropriate. The way she responded by attacking parenting skills instead of addressing the original comment directly could be seen as the issue here.\n"
