I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought her husband a PS4 Pro and a game for his birthday, which she mentions cost her her entire biweekly paycheck. She posted a picture of the gift on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she had bought the same thing for the cousin on Christmas, implying that the author isn't special. The author then called her out, leading to an argument where the cousin's girlfriend called her a bitch. Now the cousin's girlfriend is upset because the author criticized her parenting skills, maybe because they had a baby in November and were asking for money for diapers and formula recently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that the comment was a personal attack on her gift and her efforts. She's proud of buying the gift, especially since it was a significant expense for her. The cousin's girlfriend's comment could come off as dismissive or condescending, which might justify the author's reaction. However, the author's response was to \"call her out,\" which might have escalated the situation. \n\nThe key points here are the nature of the original comment and the author's response. The cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was about the gift not making the author special, which might be a way to belittle her. But the author's response involved pointing out the cousin's financial situation\u2014suggesting hypocrisy because the cousin had a baby and was asking for money but could afford an expensive gift. That could be crossing into personal attacks, especially mentioning parenting skills, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nThe author might feel justified in defending her choice and the effort she put in, but attacking the cousin's parenting could be seen as inappropriate. The cousin's girlfriend's comment about the gift wasn't about the author's parenting, so the author's response might be overstepping. Also, the fact that the cousin's girlfriend is 20 and the author is 24 might mean they have different life circumstances, but that's probably not the main issue here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The cousin's girlfriend's initial comment was perhaps rude, but the author's response involved bringing up the cousin's financial situation and parenting, which could be considered an attack. The author might think she was defending her gift, but the way she responded could be seen as crossing the line. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because she took the conversation beyond the initial comment and attacked the other person's parenting, which isn't related to the original issue. Even if the initial comment was hurtful, responding with personal attacks isn't appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
