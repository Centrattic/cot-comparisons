I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for responding to a comment from her husband's cousin's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a PS4 Pro and a game for her husband's birthday. She posted it on Facebook, and the cousin's girlfriend commented that she bought the same for the cousin on Christmas and said the author isn't special. The author was upset because she spent her entire paycheck on the gift, and the other couple had recently asked for help with baby expenses. She called the girlfriend out, leading to her being called a bitch, and now the girlfriend is upset over parenting comments.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: The author felt her gift was being diminished. The cousin's girlfriend's comment was confrontational, possibly dismissive. The author's response was defensive, leading to escalation. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might argue that public confrontation isn't the best approach. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but responding by calling out her parenting could have been unkind. The author's actions might have escalated the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was defending her gift and her pride in spending her hard-earned money. The girlfriend's comment might have been perceived as judgmental, especially considering the other couple's recent financial requests. The author's response could be seen as a reaction to being belittled.\n\nBut is calling out parenting skills a fair response? If the author made personal attacks, that's where the line is crossed. The girlfriend's comment was about the gift, not parenting. If the author brought up parenting, that's probably where she went wrong. The question is whether the author overstepped by making the response personal.\n\nAlso, considering the context: the author has no children, so maybe she shouldn't compare parenting skills. If she used the other couple's recent financial situation to imply they're bad parents, that's a stretch. Public shaming via social media is generally not advisable. Even if the original comment was rude, responding with another jab about parenting could be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the initial comment was harsh, but the author's retaliation with a personal attack on parenting skills is likely where she's at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
