I posted the pictures on my Facebook of what I\u2019d bought him and his cousins girlfriend responded \u201coh, I bought that for (the cousin) on Christmas, you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\nI immediately was pissed as fuck because \n\n1) I make about 500$ every two weeks, so this gift cost me my entire check, and I was very proud of it and excited for him to have it.  He\u2019s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I\u2019m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn\u2019t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she\u2019s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out the cousin's girlfriend after she commented on the birthday gift. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought a significant gift for her husband, which the cousin's girlfriend then criticized, implying the author's gift wasn't special because she had given something similar for Christmas. The author got angry and called the girl out, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points to consider are the context of the gift and the response. The author mentions that the gift cost her her entire paycheck, and she was proud of it. The cousin's family had a baby recently and asked for money for diapers and formula, which adds to the frustration. The girlfriend's comment likely felt dismissive and judgmental, especially given the financial sacrifice the author made.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to call the girl out. The question is whether that response was justified. Arguing on Facebook about someone else's gifts could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a public forum. The author's reaction escalated the situation, leading to name-calling. The cousin's girlfriend also called her a \"bitch,\" which is rude, but the initial response (calling out parenting skills) might have been the trigger for that. \n\nThe author's justification is that the comment was hurtful and dismissive. But reacting by attacking the other person's parenting skills might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author took the comment personally and responded in a way that wasn't constructive. \n\nAdditionally, the author's husband is 26, and she's 24, while the cousin's girlfriend is 20. The age difference might not matter, but it could influence how their interactions are perceived. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often feel protective of their gifts and their choices, especially when they've made sacrifices. However, responding with hostility can be counterproductive. The author might have felt disrespected, but the way she handled it might not have been appropriate. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author's response was a valid defense of her feelings or an overreaction that escalated a minor conflict. Publicly calling someone out on Facebook for a gift comment, especially by attacking their parenting, is likely to be seen as inconsiderate and aggressive. \n\nSo, while the cousin's girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response might have been the wrong approach. Instead of a direct attack, perhaps a more measured response or addressing it privately could have been better. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the conflict with an aggressive reply.\n"
