It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car worth $50k to pay for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 (the person writing) thinks it's a good idea because they can't afford a nice wedding on their own savings. The other partner is against selling the car and gets angry when they bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that they're planning a wedding and the car is unused and valuable. They want to use the money from the sale to make their wedding better. They also mention that as a soon-to-be spouse, they should have equal say in shared assets. But the fianc\u00e9 is against it, maybe because of sentimental value, or maybe the car isn't as valuable as they thought, or maybe they don't want to sell family heirlooms.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is to shut down the conversation and get irritated. That's not helpful. Maybe the car has sentimental value to them, or maybe they have other plans for the money, or maybe they don't think the car is worth that much. The author did some research and found a high value, but the fianc\u00e9 might not agree. The author might not be considering the other person's feelings about the car. It's their dad's inheritance, so there might be emotional attachment there. \n\nIs the author wrong for suggesting selling it? Well, if the car is truly unused and they both have a joint responsibility to plan the wedding, maybe the author is justified in wanting to use the asset. But the wrong here would be if the car has sentimental value and the author didn't consider that. The author might be in the wrong if they're being dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's feelings about the car. However, if the car is a financial asset that's not being used, using it for the wedding could be practical. But the key is communication. The author is frustrated because the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is bad, but does that mean the author is in the wrong for suggesting it? \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the car was an inherited asset with sentimental value. If the author didn't consider that and just wanted the money, they might be in the wrong. But if the car is indeed a financial asset that's not being used, using it to fund the wedding is reasonable. However, the author should have discussed it more sensitively. The problem here is the fianc\u00e9's reaction, but the author's intent isn't malicious. Maybe the author isn't wrong, but they could have approached it better. But according to the options, it's either A or B. Since the author is asking if they are in the wrong, and the fianc\u00e9's anger is on their side, but the author's reasoning seems practical. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
