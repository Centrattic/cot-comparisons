It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation again.\n\nThe user is engaged and they can't save enough for a wedding they want. They found out their fianc\u00e9 has an old car in the garage that's worth $50k. They want to sell it, but he's against it and won't discuss it. She feels they should share assets and have equal say, but he's getting mad. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's car was left to him by his dad. Maybe he has sentimental value for it. Even if it's old, he might not want to sell it for personal reasons. The author wants to use the money for the wedding, which she's passionate about. However, the fianc\u00e9's refusal might be because of attachment, not just stubbornness. \n\nOwnership of assets in a relationship can be a gray area. They are engaged but not yet married. Depending on their location, legal ownership might still be individual unless they've set up a joint account or shared property. The author might assume joint ownership, but the fianc\u00e9 might see it as his personal property. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author keeps bringing it up, but he gets upset. Maybe she's not giving him space to explain his reasons. He might feel she's pressuring him to part with something important to him. The frustration from both sides is mutual. \n\nIs selling the car a reasonable suggestion? It could be, but if the car has sentimental value or the fianc\u00e9 has other reasons (like maybe it's needed for emergencies, even though it's unused?), that's another layer. The author assumes it's just taking up space, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong to want to use shared resources for their future, but she might be overstepping if the car is his personal asset. The fianc\u00e9 isn't wrong to have his own feelings about the car. The conflict here is about differing priorities and communication breakdown.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? It's a bit of a 50-50. The author wants a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9's feelings about the car are valid. However, the author is pressuring him without considering his feelings, which could be wrong. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 isn't engaging in discussion, which is also a problem. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. If she's using the car's value without considering his emotional attachment, maybe she is. However, if they are planning to marry, it's reasonable to expect shared financial planning. The answer might depend on cultural or legal norms about pre-marital assets. In many places, until married, assets are separate. So if the car is his, she can't assume she can sell it. So maybe she's overstepping by insisting on selling his personal property without his consent. Hence, she might be in the wrong.\n"
