It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to fund the wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple is engaged, been planning for over a year, but they can't afford a big wedding. The author found out the car is worth $50k and wants to sell it, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it. The author feels they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nHmm. So the main points here. The car was left by the fianc\u00e9's dad. Maybe there's sentimental value? The author did some research and thinks selling it would help them have a better wedding. But the fianc\u00e9 is resistant and gets irritated. The author feels they're being unreasonable.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. In a relationship, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The car is part of the fianc\u00e9's inheritance, which can be a sensitive issue. People often value sentimental things even if they have monetary worth. The author might not realize that the car isn't just an asset but a connection to his father. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to prioritize the wedding, which is a shared future goal. They might feel that using the car's value is a practical solution. But the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests it's not just about the money. Maybe he's attached to the car, or it's a symbol of his family. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they did take the initiative to research and propose a solution. However, they might not have considered the emotional aspect. The key is whether the car is a personal item for the fianc\u00e9. If it's just a car, maybe not, but if it's meaningful, then the author is overstepping by pushing to sell it without understanding his perspective. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but forcing the sale without discussion could be seen as disregarding the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The right approach would be to have a calm conversation about why the car is important to him and explore other options. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering the emotional value and for persisting when the fianc\u00e9 was already against it. \n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9 didn't engage in a reasonable discussion. The author is his fianc\u00e9, so they should have equal say in shared assets. However, until they are married, their assets might not be fully shared. The car is his inheritance, which is typically considered personal property. So using it without his consent might be a boundary issue. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the fianc\u00e9's personal asset, which has sentimental value. Even if it's not used, it's his to decide, and pushing to sell it without considering his feelings is unfair.\n"
