It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to fund their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 found out the car is worth $50k, which they could use for a better wedding, but the other partner is against it. The author is frustrated because they feel their input should be considered since they're engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the engagement status. When two people are engaged, they're not yet married, so legally, their assets might still be separate unless they've entered into some agreements. The car was inherited by the fianc\u00e9, so it's likely their personal property. The author wants to sell it, but the fianc\u00e9 is the owner. Even in a committed relationship, the owner has the right to decide what to do with their own property unless there's a joint ownership agreement.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. They can't afford a big wedding, and the author is disappointed. But is it fair to pressure someone to sell an inherited item they might have sentimental value to? The author mentions the car is old and unused, but maybe there's more to it. The fianc\u00e9's refusal could be due to reasons beyond money, like family history or personal attachment.\n\nCommunication is another angle. The author says the fianc\u00e9 shuts them down and gets irritated. That's not healthy communication. However, the author is pushing for a decision on the fianc\u00e9's personal property without respecting their wishes. The author might be right to want input on shared financial decisions, but they're overstepping by demanding the sale of someone else's asset.\n\nAlso, the timing. The engagement has lasted over a year because of financial constraints. The author wants to use the car money for the wedding, but maybe they should have discussed financial priorities earlier. Now, pushing for a sale might be seen as last-minute pressure.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's desire for a memorable wedding is valid, but so is the fianc\u00e9's right to decide what to do with his inherited car. The author is assuming joint ownership without the fianc\u00e9's consent. That's where the potential wrongdoing is. They're trying to use someone else's property without mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to be upset if he feels his ownership is being ignored.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the fianc\u00e9's ownership of the car and for not having a more respectful or earlier discussion about their financial goals.\n"
