It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting selling the car to pay for the wedding. The situation is that they're engaged, saving for a wedding but can only afford a basic one. The fianc\u00e9 has an old car that's not used, which the author researched and found to be worth $50k. When she brought it up, he got upset and wouldn't discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that the car isn't being used and could help fund a more memorable wedding. She feels they should share assets and have equal say. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might value the car for sentimental reasons (he inherited it from his dad) or maybe he has other plans for the money. \n\nIs selling the car a reasonable suggestion? If it's unused and valuable, maybe it's practical. However, the car might have emotional value to him. The author didn't consider that angle and pushed despite his resistance. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be due to the sentimental aspect rather than just financial. \n\nThe author's frustration is about shared assets and equal say, but the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as his personal inheritance. Maybe they didn't communicate well about the significance of the car. The author might be assuming he doesn't care about the car, but he could have reasons to keep it. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends. She's trying to solve a problem they're facing, but maybe didn't approach it with enough understanding of his feelings. She might be in the right in wanting to use the car's value for their wedding, but she's not considering his emotional attachment. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect for each other's values. \n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether the car has sentimental value. If the author didn't know about that and just thought it was a practical thing to sell, maybe she's not entirely wrong. But if she dismissed his feelings without understanding, that's a problem. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9 got more irritated as she pushed, maybe she should have backed off and tried to find another solution. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's trying to improve their wedding situation, and the car isn't being used. However, her approach might need to be more empathetic. But according to the problem, the answer should be A or B. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. Since she's making a valid point about using an asset they have, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening, maybe she's not wrong. But maybe she is because she's not respecting his feelings. Hmm. \n\nWait, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the car was a family heirloom with sentimental value, then selling it might not be the right move. However, the author didn't consider that. But the fianc\u00e9 didn't explain that either. So maybe it's a communication issue on both sides. The author's approach was pushy, but her intention is reasonable. So maybe she's not wrong. Answer B.\n"
