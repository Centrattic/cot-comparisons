It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting selling the fianc\u00e9's old car to fund the wedding.\n\nFirst, the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. That might have sentimental value, even if it's not used. The author found out it's worth $50k online. But the fianc\u00e9 is against selling it. The author wants to use the money for a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset and not having the discussion.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Both are engaged, so they're planning to merge their lives. But assets can be a sensitive topic. The car was his inheritance, so he might feel it's personal. Even if they share expenses, selling a sentimental item could be a big deal. The author is pushing hard, and the fianc\u00e9 is getting irritated. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, suggesting using assets for a shared goal isn't inherently wrong, but maybe not respecting his feelings about the car is. The key is whether the car has sentimental value and if the author considered that before pushing. If the fianc\u00e9 feels it's important not to sell, the author should maybe back off unless there's a compromise. \n\nAlso, financial planning should be mutual. The author might be right to want a better wedding, but the approach could be better. Instead of insisting on selling the car, maybe discussing other options or saving more together. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be valid if the car isn't just a car but a family heirloom. So the author's insistence without considering the emotional aspect could be part of the problem. So I'd lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
