It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to fund a more elaborate wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that since they're engaged and planning to get married, their assets should be shared. The car was inherited and not used, so selling it could help with the wedding. The fianc\u00e9, however, is against it and gets irritated when the author brings it up.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about shared assets and communication. The author believes that because they're engaged, the car is a shared asset. But legally, unless they're married or have a prenup, inherited property is usually considered separate. So the fianc\u00e9 might have a right to decide what to do with his dad's car. \n\nThe author wants to use the car's value for the wedding, which makes sense for them to have a special day. But the fianc\u00e9's reaction is a problem. If he's not open to discussion, that's a communication issue. However, the author might be overstepping by pressuring him to sell something that's important to him, even if it's not being used.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they can't save enough for a better wedding, so they're trying to find another source. But is it fair to expect the fianc\u00e9 to liquidate an inherited asset for the wedding? Maybe the author didn't consider the emotional value the car might have for the fianc\u00e9, even if it's old. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be right in wanting a say in shared finances, but the approach could be wrong if it's causing conflict without mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss calmly might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention is valid\u2014trying to make the wedding better with available resources. But if the car is his separate property, she shouldn't unilaterally decide to sell it. The wrong might be in pressuring him without considering his feelings or the nature of the asset. Alternatively, the fianc\u00e9's lack of communication is also a problem. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the car is his inherited asset, and she's pushing to sell it without mutual agreement, which is his right to refuse. Even if they're engaged, they aren't legally married, so his assets are still his until the marriage. She should respect his decision and find other ways to plan the wedding they can afford together without forcing him to sell something he's attached to.\n"
