It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for suggesting selling her fianc\u00e9's old car to fund their wedding.\n\nFirst, the couple is engaged and struggling to save for a wedding. The fianc\u00e9 has an unused car worth $50k. The author wants to sell it, but he's resistant. She argues that they should share assets and that the car isn't being used. He's getting angry and not discussing it.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, until they're married, assets might still be separate if they weren't joint. So if the car was inherited by him, it's his property. But they're planning to get married, so maybe they're treating some assets as shared. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as sentimental or have other reasons not to sell it. The author is focused on using the money for the wedding, which is a shared goal, but the fianc\u00e9 might have different priorities or attachments to the car.\n\nCommunication is a big part here. The author feels frustrated because he's not engaging in the discussion, but maybe he's not communicating his reasons clearly. The author's approach might be coming off as dismissive of his feelings about the car. However, she's trying to solve a problem they both face (funding the wedding). \n\nIs it wrong to suggest selling an asset to pay for a shared expense? If the car is his, she might not have the right to force the sale, but suggesting it as an option isn't inherently wrong. The issue might be the lack of mutual agreement and his refusal to discuss it respectfully. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether using shared assets for a wedding requires mutual consent. If they're treating the car as a joint asset, then she's in the right. If it's his personal property, then maybe she's overstepping. But since they're engaged and planning a joint future, the expectation might be to use shared resources for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss it without getting angry could be the issue here. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author's actions might be seen as reasonable if the car is considered a joint asset. However, if it's his personal inheritance, she might be in the wrong for not respecting his ownership. But since the car is unused and taking up space, the argument for selling it is strong. The main problem is the communication breakdown. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because she's trying to use an asset that's not being used for a shared goal, and his refusal without discussion is the problem. But if the car is his personal property, maybe she's in the wrong. However, the context says they're engaged and saving together, so maybe it's a joint issue. The key is that she's suggesting a solution, not forcing the sale. So, likely, the answer is B.\n"
