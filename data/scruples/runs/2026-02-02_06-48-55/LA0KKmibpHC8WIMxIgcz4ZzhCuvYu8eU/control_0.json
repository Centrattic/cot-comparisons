It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for a wedding. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, and it's worth $50k. The author brought up the idea, but the fianc\u00e9 got mad and wouldn't discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that they want a special wedding and they can't save enough. The car is unused and taking up space. They think selling it would help them have the wedding they want. They also mention that as a future spouse, they should have an equal say in their shared assets. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as a sentimental item from his father. Even if it's not used, it might hold emotional value, not just monetary. The author might be overlooking that. Also, ownership of assets before marriage can be a sensitive topic. If the car was inherited by him individually, it might not be considered a shared asset yet, depending on their legal status. The author is assuming shared ownership, but maybe the fianc\u00e9 sees it as his personal property. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 shut down the conversation and got irritated. The author kept pushing, which might have caused tension. Maybe the approach wasn't respectful or considered the fianc\u00e9's feelings. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, wanting to use the car's value for the wedding isn't inherently wrong, but how they approached it matters. If the car has sentimental value and the author didn't consider that, that's a problem. Also, if the car is his personal inheritance, the author might not have the right to demand its sale. The key points are mutual respect, communication, and understanding of each other's values. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the fianc\u00e9's feelings about the car and for assuming shared ownership without discussion. But if the car is indeed an unused asset that could help their shared goals, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong either. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional aspect and maybe overstepped regarding ownership.\n"
