It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for suggesting selling the car to pay for the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their fianc\u00e9 are planning a wedding but can't afford a big one. They found out an old car in the garage is worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 is against selling it, and the author feels frustrated because they think using the car's value would help the wedding. They argue that as a future spouse, they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nSo, the main points are: \n1. The car is unused and valuable, inherited.\n2. The fianc\u00e9 refuses to discuss selling it.\n3. The author wants to use the money for the wedding.\n4. The author feels they should have equal say in shared assets.\n\nIs the author right to push for selling it? Well, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has sentimental value. Cars left by family can be important to people. The author didn't consider that maybe the car isn't just an asset but holds emotional value. \n\nBut then, the author is in a relationship and wants to contribute to their wedding. They might think it's fair to use the car's value since it's an asset. However, if the fianc\u00e9 is against it, maybe the author should respect his wishes. The key here is communication. The author tried to discuss it, but the fianc\u00e9 shut down the conversation. Maybe the author should have approached it differently, like understanding why he's against selling it first instead of pushing immediately.\n\nAlso, the part about shared assets is tricky. If they are planning to get married, perhaps they should be discussing finances together. But the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as his personal inheritance, not a shared asset yet. The author's frustration is valid, but maybe the approach was too direct without considering emotional attachment.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find a middle ground. The author's main issue is wanting the wedding they desire, but forcing the sale without understanding the other person's perspective could be seen as overstepping. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9's refusal is due to emotional reasons, the author might not be wrong to want to use the asset, but perhaps the method was flawed. \n\nThe answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons for wanting to use the car's value for the wedding. However, their approach could have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the approach. Since the fianc\u00e9's attachment isn't mentioned as being considered by the author, maybe the author is being inconsiderate. Wait, the author did mention the car is unused and just takes up space. The fianc\u00e9's refusal is the issue. If the author is trying to use a shared asset for a shared goal (the wedding), maybe they're justified. On the other hand, the car might be his personal property, and the author is pressuring him. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that they're engaged and planning a shared future, maybe the author is right to want to use the asset. However, the way they're approaching it without considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings might be the problem. The key is mutual respect. If the author is forcing the issue, they might be in the wrong. But if they're trying to find a solution together, maybe not. Since the fianc\u00e9 is refusing to discuss it, the author's frustration is understandable. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B (no, not in the wrong) because the author is trying to use an asset that's not being used for a shared expense. The fianc\u00e9's refusal without discussion is the main issue. So the author isn't in the wrong for making a suggestion, even if the approach could be better.\n"
