It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wants their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to pay for the wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant and getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple is engaged and planning a wedding, but they don't have enough savings. The author found out the car is worth $50k and wants to sell it. The fianc\u00e9 isn't open to discussion and gets irritated. \n\nThe author argues that as a future spouse, they should share assets and have equal say. But the fianc\u00e9's car was left to him by his dad, which might have sentimental value. Maybe it's not just about money for him. He might value the car emotionally, even if it's unused. \n\nThe author's motivation is understandable\u2014they want a memorable wedding. But is it fair to pressure someone to sell a sentimental item without considering their feelings? The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests that selling the car is a big deal to him. The author might be overlooking the emotional aspect here. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the fianc\u00e9 shut down the conversation and got angry. Communication is key in relationships. If the author keeps pushing without listening, that could be a problem. The fianc\u00e9 might feel disrespected or that his inheritance is being disregarded. \n\nThe author's argument about shared assets is valid in a marriage, but this is a pre-marriage situation. They're not legally married yet, so the ownership of the car might still be his. The author's approach might be seen as overstepping, especially if he didn't want to discuss it further. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to solve a financial problem. But maybe there's another way to approach this. Instead of insisting on selling the car, they could explore other options for the wedding budget. The author's frustration is real, but the method of addressing it might be causing more conflict. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's intent is good, but the approach might be wrong. They should respect the fianc\u00e9's feelings about the car and perhaps find a compromise. The answer would lean towards A (in the wrong) because they're not considering the emotional value and insisting without discussion.\n"
