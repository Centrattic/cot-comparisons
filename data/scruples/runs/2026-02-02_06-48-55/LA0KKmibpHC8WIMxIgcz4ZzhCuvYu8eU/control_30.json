It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.

It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for their wedding. The car is in the garage, unused, and worth a lot. The fianc\u00e9 thinks they should sell it, but the other person is against it. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 won't discuss it and gets angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They're engaged, so they're planning a shared future. The author wants a special wedding, and the car is seen as an asset that could help. But the fianc\u00e9 is resistant. Why? Maybe the car has sentimental value, even if it's old. The car came from his dad, so it might have emotional significance. Maybe he doesn't want to sell it for reasons beyond money. \n\nThe author argues that shared assets mean shared decisions. But is the car considered a shared asset? If the car was left to him specifically by his father, maybe it's his personal property, not jointly owned. In many places, unless they're married with joint ownership, individual assets might belong to one person. So the fianc\u00e9 might see it as his to decide what to do with. \n\nThe author did some research and found it's worth a lot. But the fianc\u00e9 might have a different perspective. Maybe he's planning to fix it up, or it's a family heirloom he wants to keep. The author's approach could come off as dismissive of his feelings. When she kept pushing, he got more irritated. That suggests that the car is important to him in a non-material way. \n\nIs the author wrong for suggesting selling it? It depends on the context. She wants to improve their wedding experience, which is understandable. But she needs to respect his emotional attachment. Forcing the issue without considering his feelings might be the problem. The key is communication. If he's not willing to discuss it, maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. \n\nSo, the author's intention is good, but maybe her approach is flawed. She might be prioritizing the wedding over his emotional needs. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss it might stem from feeling that his feelings aren't valued. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not considering the sentimental value and pushing too hard. \n\nBut then again, they're a team. If they're saving for a wedding, maybe they should be pooling resources. However, if the car is his personal asset, it's his choice. The question is whether selling it is a shared decision. If it's his to decide, then the author overstepped. If it's a shared asset, then she's justified. But since they're not married yet, it's unclear. \n\nIn most cases, pre-marital assets are separate unless they're in a civil union or have specific agreements. So the car is likely his. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for pressuring him to sell something that's not jointly owned, especially when it's emotionally significant. She should respect his wishes, even if she disagrees. The answer might be A.\n"
