It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting selling their fianc\u00e9's old car to fund a wedding. The fianc\u00e9 got the car from his dad, it's unused and worth $50k. The author wants to use the money for a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. Since the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his father, it's technically his personal property unless they have a shared account or joint ownership agreement. They are engaged but not married yet, so legally, the car might still be his alone. The author might not have the right to decide to sell it without his consent, even though they are planning to marry.\n\nThen, their financial situation is tight. They can only afford a basic wedding, but the author wants something more special. Using the car's value could help, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it. Maybe the car has sentimental value to him, which the author didn't consider. The author did check online and found the value, but the fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment might be a factor here.\n\nThe author's argument is about shared assets and equal say, but until they are married, sharing assets isn't automatic. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from personal reasons beyond just money. The frustration comes from wanting to use available resources, but if the car isn't theirs to sell, the author might be overstepping.\n\nI should also think about communication. The author kept bringing it up, leading to irritation. Maybe they didn't understand the fianc\u00e9's perspective. However, the fianc\u00e9 not engaging in discussion is also problematic. But legally and ethically, the car is his, so selling it without consent could be an issue. The author's intention is good, but the approach might be wrong. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't respect the fianc\u00e9's ownership and pushed the issue despite his objections.\n"
