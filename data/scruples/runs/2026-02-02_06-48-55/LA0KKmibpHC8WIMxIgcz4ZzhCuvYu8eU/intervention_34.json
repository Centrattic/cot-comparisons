It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to fund a wedding. The fianc\u00e9 got the car from his dad, it's old and unused, and the author found out it's worth $50k. But the fianc\u00e9 is against selling it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're engaged, and they can't afford a wedding they want. The author wants to use the car's value. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset and refuses to discuss it. The author feels they should share assets and have an equal say.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his father. Maybe it has sentimental value. The author didn't consider that maybe he doesn't want to sell it, even if it's not used. They should have talked about it before proposing selling it. The author might have assumed the car was a shared asset, but it was his fianc\u00e9's inheritance. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting his feelings about the car. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss might be his way of protecting the car, which the author didn't fully understand. So, answer A.\n"
