It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author, a fianc\u00e9e, wants to sell the car her fianc\u00e9 inherited from his dad. The car is unused and worth $50k, which would help them afford a better wedding. She thinks they should share assets and have equal say. Her fianc\u00e9 is against it, doesn't want to discuss it, and gets irritated.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I have to decide A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The car is his inheritance. Inheriting an asset is a personal matter. Even in a committed relationship, unless they're legally married or have a prenup specifying shared assets, the car is his. The fianc\u00e9e might believe in shared finances because they're engaged, but legally and traditionally, until married, assets are individual. \n\nShe did some research and found the car's value. Maybe she didn't consider the sentimental value. The fianc\u00e9 might not want to sell it for reasons beyond money\u2014maybe emotional attachment. He's not being open about his reasons, which is problematic, but the initial action is the author pushing to sell his inherited property without his consent. \n\nShe's frustrated because she wants to use the money, but she's not considering his feelings. Even if they're sharing savings, the car is his. She's pressuring him to sell it, which he's against. That's a conflict of values: her wanting to prioritize the wedding versus his attachment to the car.\n\nIs she in the wrong? She's trying to use his asset without his agreement. Even with good intentions, using someone else's property without their consent is a problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is not great, but the author's approach might be overstepping. So maybe she's partially at fault. \n\nBut the user thinks she's in the wrong. So perhaps the answer is A. However, some might argue that in a relationship, they should discuss finances together. But the key point is the car is his inheritance. Unless they have a joint agreement, she can't unilaterally decide to sell it. So yeah, she's overstepping by pressuring him without respecting his ownership. So A makes sense.\n"
