It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e suggesting selling an old, unused car worth $50k to help fund their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets irritated when she brings it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is old, unused, and inherited. The couple can't save much for the wedding, and the fianc\u00e9e thinks selling it would help. The fianc\u00e9 is not open to discussion and gets angry. The author feels their assets should be shared and wants input.\n\nIs she wrong? Well, the car is his inheritance, so he might have sentimental value. She's assuming they can sell it without considering his feelings. Couples should communicate and compromise. Maybe she should have discussed it more gently first. But he's not listening at all. So both have points. However, in relationships, respecting each other's assets and feelings is important. She might be overstepping by pushing to sell something he values. But the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also poor. \n\nBut the question is if she's in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because she's using his inheritance without his consent for their wedding, which is a shared expense but the car is his. However, the fianc\u00e9's response is also bad. But the question is about the author. Maybe she's not entirely wrong because wanting a better wedding is understandable, but she didn't approach it correctly. However, the initial answer might be that she's in the wrong for not respecting his wishes and pushing too hard without considering his feelings about the car. So answer A.\n"
