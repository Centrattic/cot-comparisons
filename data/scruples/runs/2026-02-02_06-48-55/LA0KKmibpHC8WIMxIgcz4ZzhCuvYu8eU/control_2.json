It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell a car worth $50k to fund their wedding. The fianc\u00e9's partner is against it, and the author feels they should have shared control over shared assets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal ownership of the car. If the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 specifically by his dad, it might be his personal property, not a shared asset yet. In some places, unless the ring is on the finger, assets are considered separate until marriage. So, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with his inherited car.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The couple can't afford a big wedding and the fianc\u00e9 wants to use the car's value. But the fianc\u00e9's partner is against selling it. The author is frustrated because they want to use the money, but the other person doesn't want to discuss it. The key here is mutual financial decisions. Even if the car is a shared asset, the author's approach might be seen as pressuring someone to sell something they're emotionally attached to. The partner's resistance could be non-negotiable, leading to conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the car's value. The author estimates $50k, but maybe the car isn't actually worth that. If the estimation is wrong, selling it might not provide the expected funds. The author's assumption here could be a mistake.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect. The car might have sentimental value to the fianc\u00e9's father, making it difficult to sell. The author might not realize the emotional ties, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They want to use shared resources for the wedding, but if the car isn't a shared asset, they might be overstepping. Additionally, the approach of pressuring someone to sell something they're against could be seen as wrong. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) if the car isn't a shared asset and they're pressuring the other person. Alternatively, if the car is considered a shared asset, maybe B (not in the wrong). But typically, unless the marriage has already been formalized, assets are separate. So, the author is overstepping by trying to sell the fianc\u00e9's personal property without agreement. Hence, answer A.\n"
