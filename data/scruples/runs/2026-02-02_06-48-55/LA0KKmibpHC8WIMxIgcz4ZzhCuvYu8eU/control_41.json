That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.

It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell an old, unused car to pay for their wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They're engaged for over a year, and both are struggling to save enough for a wedding. The author found out that the car, which is old and not used, is worth $50k. She wants to sell it to get a better wedding, but he's not open to the idea and gets irritated when she brings it up. She feels like they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Let's break it down. The car was left to him by his dad, so maybe there's emotional value attached. He might not want to sell it for sentimental reasons. But the author is trying to use that asset for their shared future (the wedding). They are in a committed relationship, so it's reasonable to discuss joint financial decisions. However, he's not willing to even talk about it, which is a problem. \n\nThe author's intentions are to make their wedding special, which is understandable. Financially, selling the car could help them both. The issue is whether she's overstepping. But since they are planning to get married, their assets are likely to be considered shared in the future. The fianc\u00e9's refusal without discussion might indicate a lack of communication or respect for her desires. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid reasons. The car might not actually be worth $50k (though she did her own research), or selling it could be a hassle. Or perhaps he's reluctant to touch the car because of emotional ties. But the problem is he's not engaging in a reasonable discussion. The author is trying to find a solution, and he's dismissing her. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author isn't just taking the car; she's suggesting selling it to fund a shared event. If the fianc\u00e9 is being inflexible without listening, that's a red flag. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. She's voicing her needs and looking for a way to achieve their common goal. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more concerning. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to pressure someone about an asset they personally own? Even if they are engaged, if the car is his personal property, he might have the right to decide. However, in a long-term engagement, especially when planning a shared future, it's reasonable to discuss such things. The key is whether they have a joint budget or if assets are shared. If the car is a shared asset, then yes, she has a say. If it's his alone, maybe he has more control. But the story says it's in their garage, implying it's part of their shared home. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he never uses it, so it's not like he needs the car. Selling it could be practical. The fact that he shuts down the discussion without reasoning is a problem. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong; the issue is the fianc\u00e9's lack of communication. \n\nBut could she have approached it differently? Maybe. Instead of pushing, she could have proposed the idea more gently or discussed it once rather than repeatedly. But his refusal to discuss is also a problem. \n\nOverall, the author's reasoning is practical, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction seems excessive. So the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any assumption here. Since the car is in their garage and they're engaged, it's reasonable to consider it a shared asset. His dad left it to him, but if it's not being used, maybe it's fair game. The main issue is his unwillingness to communicate. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
