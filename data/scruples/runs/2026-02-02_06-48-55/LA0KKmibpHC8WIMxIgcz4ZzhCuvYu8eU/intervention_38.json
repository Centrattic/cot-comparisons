It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged and they're not saving enough for a wedding because they can't afford much. They found out an old car in the garage, which the fianc\u00e9's dad left him, is worth $50k. The author wants to sell it to fund a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 refuses to discuss it and gets upset when she brings it up. The author feels they should share assets and decisions as a couple, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening.\n\nFirst, the car is inherited by the fianc\u00e9. In many places, inherited property is considered the individual's unless they've put it into joint ownership. The author is suggesting selling it for the wedding, which is a joint expense, but the fianc\u00e9 might see it as his personal asset. The author might think they should combine assets since they're engaged, but legally, unless it's a joint account or property, the car is his. \n\nThe author's motivation is understandable\u2014they want a memorable wedding and see a solution. However, pushing to sell something that's not theirs to decide might be crossing a line. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be about feeling disrespected or having the asset taken from him. Maybe there's sentimental value, or he doesn't want to sell it for personal reasons. The author might not be considering his feelings or the car's significance beyond monetary value. \n\nAlso, communication is key. If the author keeps bringing it up and the fianc\u00e9 gets more irritated, it's a conflict point. The author might not be listening to his perspective. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 is worried about other things, like the car being a family heirloom or needing it for some reason (even though it's unused), but the author isn't considering that. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's possible the author is overstepping by trying to sell someone else's inheritance without mutual agreement. Even if they're engaged, the car is his until they're married. The author might not have the right to demand it. However, if they were in a common law state or had joint ownership, maybe it's different. But the question is about right or wrong in the situation described. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if they're not respecting the fianc\u00e9's ownership of the car. Even if they have joint financial goals, the car isn't shared unless he transferred it. The author might be assuming joint ownership without it being the case. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're trying to sell an asset that's not theirs to decide, leading to conflict without mutual consent.\n"
