It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting selling the car to pay for the wedding. First, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author and her fianc\u00e9 are engaged and struggling to save for a wedding. They have enough for a basic ceremony but want something more special. She found out the old car (unused, inherited) is worth $50k and wants to sell it. He's against it and gets irritated when she brings it up. She feels they should share assets and have equal say, but he's not listening.\n\nNow, considering their situation, they're engaged but not yet married. The car was inherited by him, which might mean it's his personal property. However, in some jurisdictions, future spouses don't have claims over each other's assets unless they've already combined finances or there's a prenup. The key point is whether the car is his personal asset or a shared one.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they're about to get married, their assets should be shared. But legally, until they are married, his inherited car is his. Even after marriage, depending on the state, inherited property might remain separate. So selling it might require his consent. She's pushing to sell it for their mutual goal, but he's against it, possibly for sentimental reasons or other plans.\n\nIs she wrong? She's trying to solve their financial problem by using an asset they could sell. But she's pressuring him to sell something he might value for reasons beyond money. He's not engaging in discussion, which is a problem. However, the core issue is whether she has the right to demand he sell an asset that's his. If it's his separate property, she can't force him. If they are sharing finances, maybe he expects her to respect his decision. But she's arguing for equal say, which he might not agree with yet.\n\nHer frustration is valid because they're planning a joint event. But if the car is his, she can't unilaterally decide to sell it. She might be in the right in wanting to use assets for their benefit, but if the car is his, she's overstepping by insisting he sell it without his agreement. So maybe she's in the wrong because she's trying to use his personal asset without his consent. Alternatively, if they're merging finances or have a shared account, it's a different story. But based on the info given, the car is his, and she's pressuring him. Hence, answer A.\n"
