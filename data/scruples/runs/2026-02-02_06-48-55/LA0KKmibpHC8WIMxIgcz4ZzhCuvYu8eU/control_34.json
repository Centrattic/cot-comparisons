It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9e suggesting selling her fianc\u00e9's old car to help pay for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against the idea.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple is engaged, planning a wedding but can't save enough for a big one. They have a barebones budget. The fianc\u00e9e found out the car is worth $50k and wants to sell it. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant and getting angry. She feels they should share assets and have equal say, but he's not listening.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and fairness. The car was inherited by the fianc\u00e9, so it might be his personal property unless they are in a common-law state where assets are shared. The fianc\u00e9e is suggesting using it for the wedding, which is a shared goal. But the fianc\u00e9 might value the car for sentimental reasons or not want to sell it for personal reasons. \n\nShe did check the value herself, which she mentions, but maybe didn't discuss it with him first. The problem is that he's not open to discussion. The question is whether she's wrong for proposing to sell his inherited asset. \n\nOn one hand, she's trying to improve their wedding and using an asset that's underutilized. On the other, she's making a decision about his personal property without his consent. However, since they are engaged and planning a shared future, it's a gray area. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss is also problematic. \n\nBut the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for suggesting it. If the car is his, then using it without his agreement could be an issue. However, since they are planning a joint event, maybe it's reasonable to consider shared assets. But if it's his personal property, selling it without his consent is not fair. The key is whether the car is considered a shared asset. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, unless they are married or in a civil union, pre-marital assets belong to the individual. So the car is his, and she can't unilaterally decide to sell it. But she's proposing to use it for their mutual benefit. The problem is that the fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the car is considered separate property. If it's his, then she's in the wrong for pushing to sell it without his consent. However, her reasoning is about their shared goal. But the act of selling someone else's property without agreement is the issue. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she's not respecting his ownership, even if her intentions are good. Alternatively, if they are in a situation where they are sharing finances, it's more complex. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss is also a problem, but the user is asking about the author's wrongdoing. Since the car is his, she's overstepping by suggesting selling it without his consent. So, answer A.\n"
