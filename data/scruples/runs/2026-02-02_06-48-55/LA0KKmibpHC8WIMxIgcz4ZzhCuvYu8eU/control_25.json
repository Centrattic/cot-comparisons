It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his old, unused car to help pay for their wedding. They can't afford much, and she found out the car is worth $50k. He's not willing to discuss it and gets angry. She feels they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that the car is unused, taking up space, and the money could be used for a better wedding. She's a fianc\u00e9 and expects shared assets. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have sentimental value attached to the car from his father. Even if it's old, it might hold personal significance. He might feel that selling it is a personal decision, not one to be made jointly yet since they're still engaged. \n\nAlso, assets in a relationship aren't always legally shared unless married. So maybe the fianc\u00e9 sees the car as his personal property. The author is pushing for it to be used for the wedding, which is a future shared expense, but he might not agree on prioritizing it over keeping the car. \n\nIs she wrong to suggest selling it? Maybe not, since she's looking out for their shared future. But maybe she's not respecting his sentimental attachment. The key here is whether the car has personal value beyond monetary. If the car is just a car, selling it makes sense. But if it's something he's emotionally attached to, her pushing him might be disregarding that. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. If she's not respecting his feelings about the car, even if it's not being used, she might be in the wrong. However, if the car is truly obsolete and a resource they can use, she's trying to solve a problem. It's a balance between shared goals and individual assets. Without more info, but assuming the car has sentimental value, she might be in the wrong. But if it's just old and unused, she's not. Hmm. The answer hinges on the car's sentimental value. Since the author calls it \"ugly\" and unused, maybe she doesn't see the sentimental value. The fianc\u00e9's resistance could be due to that. So maybe she's not considering his feelings, hence in the wrong. But if he's just being stubborn, then not. But typically, in relationships, compromising is needed. Maybe she's overstepping by pressuring him without understanding his perspective. So answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no)?\n\nI think the answer is B (no), because she's trying to use an asset to improve their shared event, and the car isn't being used. But maybe she's not wrong. Alternatively, she might be wrong if the car is a personal item. But without knowing the car's significance, the default is that she's not in the wrong. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable. So answer B.\n"
