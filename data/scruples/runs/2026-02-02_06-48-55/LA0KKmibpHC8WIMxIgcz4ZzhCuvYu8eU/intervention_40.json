It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that the car is old, unused, and worth a lot. They want to sell it for the wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it. The author feels they should have equal say in shared assets. The fianc\u00e9 is getting angry and not discussing it rationally.\n\nHmm, so the author's reasoning is that the car is an asset they can use for their mutual benefit. But the fianc\u00e9 inherited it from his dad. Maybe there's sentimental value or personal reasons he doesn't want to sell. The author is frustrated because they can't afford a better wedding and see the car as a solution. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are about shared assets and communication. If they're engaged and planning a wedding, financial decisions should be joint. The author is trying to suggest using the car's value, which makes sense. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is shutting down the conversation, which isn't healthy. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to sell the car? Maybe not. If the car is an unused asset, selling it for a shared expense like a wedding could be reasonable. However, the car might have sentimental value, so the fianc\u00e9's objection isn't entirely irrational. The author might not have considered the emotional attachment. \n\nBut the main issue is the approach. The author researched and brought up the idea, which is logical. The problem is the fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss it. The author might be justified in wanting to use shared resources for their wedding. However, maybe the author should have had a more empathetic approach, considering the car's significance. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is trying to plan a wedding they both want, using available assets makes sense. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to communicate is the bigger issue. The author isn't wrong for suggesting selling the car; the fianc\u00e9 is wrong for not engaging. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
