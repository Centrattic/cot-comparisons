It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is engaged and wants to sell their fianc\u00e9's old unused car to help pay for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets frustrated when the author brings it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is old, unused, inherited by the fianc\u00e9. The author found out it's worth $50k. They wanted to sell it to have a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 refuses. The author feels they should have equal say over shared assets.\n\nHmm. So, is the author wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners should communicate and make decisions together. The author did check the value and thought selling it would help. But the fianc\u00e9 is emotional about the car, maybe it's sentimental. The author didn't consider his feelings. Maybe the author is being pushy, not respecting his wishes. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be being unreasonable by not discussing it calmly. \n\nBut the author is trying to improve their wedding, which is a big expense. However, using an inherited asset might not be the fianc\u00e9's choice to make, even if it's shared. The question is about shared assets. If they're engaged, maybe they are already sharing finances, but it's unclear. The author's approach seems confrontational, leading to frustration. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is negative, but maybe he has a reason. The author might be acting without considering the emotional value of the car. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't approach the discussion respectfully and are being persistent despite the fianc\u00e9's clear disapproval. They should have tried to understand his reasons first instead of insisting. So answer A.\n"
