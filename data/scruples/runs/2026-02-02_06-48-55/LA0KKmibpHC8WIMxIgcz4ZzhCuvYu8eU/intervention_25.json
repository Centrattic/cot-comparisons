It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e suggesting selling an old, unused car left to her fianc\u00e9 by his father to fund a more elaborate wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're engaged and have been for over a year, but they can't afford much for the wedding. The car is old, unused, and the fianc\u00e9 inherited it. The author found out it's worth $50k, which could help them have a better wedding. However, the fianc\u00e9 is resistant and gets irritated when the author brings it up.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author wants the wedding to be special and is looking for ways to fund it. They found a potential asset they think can be used. But the fianc\u00e9 is against selling it. The author feels they should have shared assets and equal say. \n\nI need to think about ownership. Since the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, it might be his personal property even if they are engaged. Engaged couples aren't legally married yet, so assets aren't automatically shared. Unless they have a prenup or agreed otherwise, the car might be his. The author is trying to use his asset without his consent, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's emotional response. He's getting irritated, not just disagreeing. Maybe there's sentimental value. The car might not just be a financial asset to him but also a personal item from his father. The author didn't consider his feelings, just the financial aspect. \n\nCommunication is another angle. The author keeps bringing it up despite his resistance. That could be persistent and not respecting his boundaries. Even if the author thinks they should share assets, pushing the issue might be causing more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to improve their wedding day, which is important. They might feel financially strained and see this as the only way. They might not realize the car's significance to him. But since they're not married yet, the fianc\u00e9's ownership of the car could mean the author doesn't have the right to decide its fate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the car is his, the author is trying to use it without his agreement, and the way she's approaching it is causing conflict. The author might be in the wrong here because she's not respecting his ownership and is pressuring him. But maybe there's a middle ground, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nSo, answer A for yes.\n"
