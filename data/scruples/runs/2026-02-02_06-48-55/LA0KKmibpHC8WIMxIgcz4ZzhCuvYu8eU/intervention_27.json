It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting selling her fianc\u00e9's unused, inherited car to pay for their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is engaged and trying to save for a wedding, but they can only afford a basic one. The author found a car in the garage that's worth $50k, which could help them have a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against selling it and gets angry when she brings it up.\n\nSo, the main points here are about shared assets, communication, and financial decisions in a relationship. The author believes their assets should be shared, so she wants input on how to use them. However, the car is inherited by her fianc\u00e9. In many places, inherited property is considered separate unless they have a shared account or agreed otherwise. So, maybe the fianc\u00e9 is right to be firm about it since it's his personal asset.\n\nBut the author's intention is to use the money for their wedding, which is a shared goal. However, pushing the issue and causing arguments might not be the best approach. The key here is whether the car is a shared asset. If it's his inheritance, selling it should be his decision unless they have a different agreement. The author might not be wrong in wanting to use the money for the wedding, but she shouldn't assume she can decide to sell it without his consent. She needs to respect his ownership of the car, even if they're planning a joint event. So, the author's mistake is trying to force the sale without considering his feelings and ownership rights. Therefore, the answer would be A, she's in the wrong.\n"
