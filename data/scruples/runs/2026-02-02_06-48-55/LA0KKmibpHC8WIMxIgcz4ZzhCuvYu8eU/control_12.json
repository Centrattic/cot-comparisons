It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to fund a wedding. The fianc\u00e9 found out the car is worth $50k, which would help them have a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 brings this up, but the other person is resistant and gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple is engaged and has been for over a year. They're struggling to save for a wedding because they don't earn much. The fianc\u00e9 thinks selling the car would solve their financial issues for the wedding. The car is old, unused, and inherited, so maybe the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a good idea. But the fianc\u00e9's partner is against it and shuts down the discussion.\n\nNow, thinking about ownership. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, so maybe he has sentimental value attached to it. Even if it's not used, the emotional aspect might be significant. The fianc\u00e9 wants to use their shared assets (since they're engaged) to plan a better wedding, but the other person isn't on board.\n\nFinancial decisions in relationships are tricky. Both partners should communicate and agree on major purchases or sales. The author brought up the idea, but the partner wasn't open to discussion. The author might feel they're being reasonable, but the partner's resistance could stem from other reasons\u2014maybe the car has sentimental value, or he doesn't want to sell family heirlooms. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did check the value themselves and proposed a solution to their shared problem. However, they might not have considered the emotional value the car has. The partner's refusal could be valid if the car is important to him. But the author's intention is to improve their wedding experience, which is understandable.\n\nBut here's the thing: even though they're engaged, they're not married yet. The car is his inheritance, and he might not be obligated to sell it unless they have a joint account or some agreement. The author might be assuming shared ownership, but technically, the car is his. So pushing to sell it without mutual agreement could be seen as overstepping. The author's frustration is valid, but the partner's right to decide about his own inherited property is also valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to discuss, but the partner wasn't receptive. The author might be in the wrong if they're pressuring to sell something that's not theirs to decide. However, since they're planning a shared future, there's an expectation of joint decision-making. But until they're married, individual assets might still be separate. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the car is considered a shared asset. If it's his personal property, the author might not have the right to insist on selling it. The partner's refusal isn't unreasonable if he values the car for non-monetary reasons. The author's actions might be seen as trying to use someone else's asset without considering their feelings. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the partner's wishes and the sentimental value of the car.\n"
