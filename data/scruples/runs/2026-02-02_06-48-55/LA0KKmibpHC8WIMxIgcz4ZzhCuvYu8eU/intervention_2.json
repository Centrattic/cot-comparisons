It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9e wanting to sell her fianc\u00e9's old car, worth $50k, to fund a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets angry when she brings it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they're trying to make the wedding special and are in a financial crunch. The car is unused and taking up space, so selling it seems like a practical solution. They might feel that since they're getting married, shared assets should be used for mutual benefits. The author could be frustrated because they feel their input isn't respected, especially since they're about to be married.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's side: the car was left to him by his dad. Emotionally, he might attach value to it beyond just money. Even if it's not used, it's a family heirloom. He might feel that selling it would be disrespectful to his father's memory. The fact that he's getting angry suggests strong feelings about the car. Financial planning is also a two-way street; maybe he has other reasons for keeping the car, like future use, even if it's not currently being used. The author's persistence in pushing the sale despite his resistance could be seen as pressuring him to part with something that's important to him.\n\nShared assets in a relationship can be tricky. While the author wants to use the car's value for the wedding, the fianc\u00e9 might view it as his personal property, even if it's in their garage. The argument here is whether the car is a shared asset or his personal inheritance. If it's his inheritance, he might have the right to decide its fate. The author's insistence might be overlooking his emotional attachment and personal decision-making rights.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if they feel ignored, but pushing too hard without understanding his perspective might be the issue. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author wants to use the car's value for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9's refusal needs to be respected unless there's a mutual agreement. The author might not be considering the emotional aspect of the car for him.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the emotional value of the car and for persistently pushing the sale without respecting her partner's wishes. Relationships require compromise and understanding, and forcing a decision without considering the other person's feelings can be problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
