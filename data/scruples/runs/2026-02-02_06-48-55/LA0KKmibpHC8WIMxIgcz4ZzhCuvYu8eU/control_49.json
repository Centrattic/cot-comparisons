It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car that's in the garage to fund a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 found out the car is worth $50k, but her partner is against selling it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is saving for a basic wedding but wants it to be special. The car is old, unused, and inherited. The author thinks selling it would help, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant. The author feels they should have equal say in shared assets. The fianc\u00e9 is getting irritated and not discussing it.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the car is an asset, and since they're engaged, maybe they have different views on shared finances. The author's intention is to use the car's value for the wedding, which is a shared goal. But the fianc\u00e9 might value the car for sentimental reasons or doesn't want to sell it. The author is pushing hard, which might be causing conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to ask. The fianc\u00e9 might have a right to his opinion, especially if the car is sentimental. The author might be overstepping if they're pressuring to sell without considering his feelings. However, they are planning a shared event, so using shared assets could be reasonable. \n\nBut the issue is the approach. The author is frustrated and keeps bringing it up, leading to irritation. Maybe the author should have discussed it more calmly or considered other options. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be valid if the car isn't just a financial asset but has emotional value. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is wrong in pressuring to sell. If the car isn't being used and they need the money, it's a practical solution. But if the car has sentimental value, the author's insistence could be dismissive of his feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, respecting each other's perspectives is key. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might be the problem. The fianc\u00e9's refusal without discussion could be an issue too. However, the main question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because they have a valid reason to want to use the asset for the wedding. However, the way they're approaching it (insisting, not listening) might contribute to the conflict. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, considering both sides, the answer might be B (No), because the author's intentions are reasonable, even if the execution could be better. But sometimes in these cases, pushing hard on shared assets can be seen as wrong, but it's a judgment call.\n"
