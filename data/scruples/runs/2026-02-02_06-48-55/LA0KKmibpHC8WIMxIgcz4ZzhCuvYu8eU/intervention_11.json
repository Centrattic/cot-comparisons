It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to sell their fianc\u00e9's old car to fund their wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is saving for a wedding but can only afford a basic one. They found out a car in the garage is worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 is against selling it, and the author feels they should discuss shared assets more equitably.\n\nHmm. The author's argument is that since they're a couple, their assets should be shared, so selling the car is a joint decision. But the fianc\u00e9 is resistant and gets angry when the author brings it up. The author feels it's important for the wedding and that the car is just taking up space.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, which might have sentimental value. Even if it's not used, it's part of his inheritance. Selling it could be a personal decision he's not willing to make, especially if he values it beyond monetary terms. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wants to use the money for the wedding, which is a shared goal. They're in a committed relationship, so maybe they should have joint decisions on major assets. But is the car considered a shared asset yet? Since it was his dad's gift, maybe it's still his personal property. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from wanting the wedding to be special and feeling like the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening. However, forcing someone to sell an inherited item they don't want to part with might be unreasonable. Communication is key here. The author might not be wrong in wanting to use the money, but the approach could be an issue. Maybe they should find a compromise instead of insisting on selling it.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the car is his personal asset, then the author might not have the right to demand its sale. Even in a relationship, respecting each other's property rights is important. The author is pushing for a decision that affects someone else's inheritance without considering the emotional aspect. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the fianc\u00e9's wishes regarding an inherited item. The solution would be to find another way to fund the wedding instead of insisting on selling the car against his will.\n"
