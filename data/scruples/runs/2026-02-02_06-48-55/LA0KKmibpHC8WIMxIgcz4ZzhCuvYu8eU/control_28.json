It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author suggesting selling a car her fianc\u00e9 inherited to help pay for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant, and she feels it's a shared asset now, so she should have a say.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The car is old and unused, worth a lot, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to sell it. The couple is trying to save for a better wedding. The author thinks using the car's value is a good idea, but he's against it. The question is about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nLegal aspects: Assets in a relationship aren't always legally shared until marriage. In many places, inherited property is considered separate unless they're married and have joint assets. So, the car might still be his separate property. That could be a point where she might be overstepping if it's not legally hers to decide.\n\nEmotional aspects: The fianc\u00e9 might have sentimental value attached to the car from his father. The author's persistence in pushing to sell it despite his resistance could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. Even if it's practical, not respecting his emotional attachment could be a problem.\n\nCommunication issues: The author mentions he shuts down and gets irritated when she brings it up. She feels she should have an equal say, but if he's not willing to discuss it, maybe there's a communication breakdown. She might not be considering his perspective, leading to frustration on both sides.\n\nIntentions: Her intent is to make the wedding special, which is understandable. However, the method of using his inherited asset without his agreement might be problematic. It's a balance between practicality and respecting each other's ownership and feelings.\n\nPossible arguments for her being wrong: She might be treating his inherited property as shared before marriage when it's not legally hers. She's pressuring him to sell something he values emotionally. The way she's approaching the conversation is causing conflict instead of trying to understand his stance.\n\nPossible arguments for her not being wrong: The wedding is a joint event, and they are planning to merge finances soon. She's trying to find a solution for their shared goal. The car isn't being used, so selling it could be practical. She's advocating for their shared future, which is valid.\n\nBut considering that the car is his inheritance and he might have reasons not to sell it, even if it's not being used, the author might be overstepping by pushing to sell it without mutual agreement. Respect for individual assets and emotions is important in a relationship. So she might be in the wrong here.\n"
