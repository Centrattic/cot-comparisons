It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old, unused car to pay for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 (the other person) is refusing to discuss it and getting angry when the author brings it up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have been engaged for over a year. They can't save much for the wedding, and the author found out the car is worth $50k. The car is old, unused, and taking up space. The author thinks it's reasonable to sell it for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it. The author is frustrated because they feel they should have an equal say in shared assets.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. Is it wrong for the author to suggest selling an inherited asset? The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, so maybe there's sentimental value or other reasons he doesn't want to sell. The author might not realize that the car isn't just about money for the fianc\u00e9. On the other hand, the author is trying to use the asset to improve their wedding, which they see as important. \n\nThe key points here are communication, shared assets, and understanding each other's perspectives. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 shuts down the conversation and gets irritated. That's a red flag because it's about how the discussion is handled. Even if the author's idea is reasonable, the fianc\u00e9's refusal to engage in a discussion is problematic. But does that mean the author is in the wrong? \n\nIf the car is considered a shared asset, the author might have a right to discuss its use. However, the car was inherited, which sometimes can be a point of contention. In many places, inherited property is considered separate unless otherwise agreed. So maybe the author is overstepping by insisting on selling it without the fianc\u00e9's consent. \n\nBut the situation is that the author is suggesting selling the car, which is not being used, to fund the wedding they both want to be special. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme\u2014shutting down the conversation. The author's frustration is valid if the car is a shared asset. However, if the car is the fianc\u00e9's personal property, the author's insistence might not be respecting that. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the relationship's dynamics and ownership of the car. The author might not be in the wrong if the car is a shared asset and the fianc\u00e9 isn't being communicative. But if the car is separate, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring to sell it without considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The situation is a bit ambiguous without more context on ownership. However, the main issue seems to be the lack of communication and willingness to discuss from the fianc\u00e9's side. The author's request is about using an asset to benefit a joint goal (the wedding), which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to talk about it is unhelpful. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to find a solution to a shared problem. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is more concerning here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The problem lies more in the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to communicate and consider the proposal.\n"
