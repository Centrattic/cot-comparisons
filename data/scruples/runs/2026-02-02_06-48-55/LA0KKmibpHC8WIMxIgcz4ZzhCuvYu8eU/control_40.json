It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation is about a couple who's engaged and planning a wedding but can't afford a big one because they don't have enough savings. The fianc\u00e9 has an old car worth $50k that he doesn't use, and the author wants to sell it to fund a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, and the author feels frustrated because they think their assets should be shared.\n\nFirst, I should consider ownership of the car. The car was left to him by his dad, so he might consider it personal property. Even though they're engaged and planning to get married, the car might not be a shared asset yet. In many places, until they are married, each person's assets remain separate unless they choose to combine them. So selling it without his consent could be an issue.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The car has sentimental value. The fianc\u00e9 might not just see it as a car but as a memento from his father. The author didn't mention discussing this sentiment, which could be a reason he's resistant. Maybe he's attached to it, and the author didn't consider that.\n\nAlso, the author's approach. She did some research and found the car's value. But when she brought it up, he shut down. Maybe she didn't present it as a joint decision or didn't understand his feelings about the car. Approaching it as a collaborative discussion might have been better than pushing for a sale.\n\nFinancial planning for the wedding is important, but maybe there are other ways to fund it without selling the car. The author wants a special day, which is understandable, but respecting his ownership of the car is also key. They might need to find a compromise or look for other solutions instead of pressuring him to sell something he's not ready to part with.\n\nIn terms of fairness, while the author is trying to make the wedding special, the fianc\u00e9's feelings and ownership rights matter. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but she could have handled it more sensitively and considered his perspective before pushing for the sale. It's a balance between sharing financial goals and respecting individual assets and emotions.\n"
