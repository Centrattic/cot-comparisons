It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his old, unused car to help fund their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been engaged over a year and can't save much for a wedding. They have enough for a basic ceremony, but the author wants a more special event. She found out that the fianc\u00e9's unused car is worth $50k, so she suggests selling it. He refuses and gets upset when she brings it up again.\n\nThe author argues that their assets should be shared and she should have a say. The fianc\u00e9, however, is against selling the car, even if it's not used. Maybe he has sentimental value attached to it, inherited from his dad. The author's frustration comes from wanting to use the car's value for the wedding, but he's not open to discussion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about shared finances and wanting a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9's perspective might be about respecting his father's legacy or not wanting to part with something that has sentimental value. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she's in a position where she's pushing for selling the car without considering his feelings. Even if she thinks it's a practical solution, if the car isn't used and just taking up space, maybe she's right in thinking it's wasteful. But on the other hand, she's not respecting his attachment to the car. \n\nMarriage involves compromise. The author might be assuming that their assets are shared, but if the car was left to him by his father, maybe it's not a joint asset yet. They might not have discussed how they handle individual assets once engaged. The issue is communication\u2014she's trying to discuss it, but he's shutting her down. However, she's also being persistent, which could be seen as pressuring him. \n\nSo, is she wrong? If the car is his personal property, selling it without his consent might be overstepping. Even if they're engaged, they might not have agreed on merging assets. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with his inherited property unless they have a prenup or agreed otherwise. She might be right in wanting to use the money for the wedding, but she's not considering his emotional attachment. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's justified in wanting to use the car's value for their future together. But since it's his car, she can't force him to sell it. The problem is that she's trying to make a decision about his asset without mutual agreement. So, perhaps she's in the wrong because she's not respecting his ownership of the car, even if he's not using it. The answer might be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because she's pressuring him to sell something that's his and has sentimental value. However, others might argue that she's trying to prioritize their shared goals. Hmm, tricky. I'm leaning towards A because she's not considering his feelings about the car and is pushing her own agenda without mutual consent.\n"
