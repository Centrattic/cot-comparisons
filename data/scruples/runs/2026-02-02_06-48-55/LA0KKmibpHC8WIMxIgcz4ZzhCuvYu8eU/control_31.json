It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for suggesting selling the old car to pay for the wedding.\n\nFirst, the engagement context: they've been engaged over a year but can't save much for a wedding. The author found out the car is worth $50k and wants to sell it. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, even getting angry when she brings it up. She feels like they should share assets and decisions.\n\nHmm, is she wrong? Well, she's a fianc\u00e9, so maybe they're still technically separate until marriage. But in some cultures, fianc\u00e9s might share assets. However, the car was inherited by her fianc\u00e9. Inheritance is usually considered separate property unless they've commingled assets. So maybe she doesn't have a legal claim to it. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. She wants to use the car's value for the wedding, which is a big life event. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant. She's frustrated because she feels they should make joint decisions. But he's upset and not open to discussion. \n\nIs her approach wrong? Maybe she didn't consider his sentimental attachment. The car might have sentimental value, even if it's old. She looked up the value without his input, which might have come off as abrupt. Communication is key here. She might have a valid point about using the money for their wedding, but if he's not willing to discuss, that's a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, he's entitled to his feelings about the car, even if it's not being used. She might be overstepping by pushing to sell it without his consent. However, since they're planning a shared future, she might believe joint decisions are necessary. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But she's trying to plan their wedding and wants to use the car's value. He's being inflexible. She might not be wrong, but maybe she could have approached it differently. The answer is probably B (No), she's not in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. But the main issue is whether she's wrong. Since he owns the car and she's pushing to sell it without considering his feelings, maybe she is in the wrong. Wait, but she's a fianc\u00e9 and they're planning together. Maybe she's not wrong. Hmm.\n\nI think the key is that the car is his inherited asset. She wants to use it for their wedding, but he's not on board. If he's not willing to discuss, she's right to want to involve him, but maybe she's wrong to insist without considering his feelings. But overall, since they're engaged, sharing resources for the wedding might be reasonable. The answer is B, No.\n"
