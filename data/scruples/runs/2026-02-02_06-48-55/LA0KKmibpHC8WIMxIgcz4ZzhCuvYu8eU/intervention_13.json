It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about the author suggesting selling a car her fianc\u00e9 inherited from his dad to fund a more elaborate wedding. They've been engaged for over a year and can only afford a basic one. The car is old, unused, and worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 is against selling it, and the author feels frustrated because he won't discuss it. She argues that as a future spouse, she should have a say over shared assets.\n\nHmm, so first, is the car a shared asset? If the fianc\u00e9 inherited it, it might be considered his personal property, not necessarily a joint asset yet. They're engaged but not married. In some places, inheritance is considered separate property unless they have a specific agreement otherwise. So maybe the author is overstepping by pushing to sell something that's not technically joint property. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment to the car could be a factor. He might have sentimental reasons for keeping it, even if it's not used. The author is focusing on the financial aspect, but he might value it for other reasons. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's desire for a memorable wedding is understandable. They're both making sacrifices, and selling the car could be a way to achieve their goals. But pushing too hard without respecting his feelings might be the issue. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid, but if the car isn't a shared asset, selling it without his consent could be a problem. The key point here is whether the author had the right to insist on selling his inherited property. If it's his, then she might be in the wrong for pressuring him. \n\nAlso, the way he's reacting\u2014getting irritated and not discussing it\u2014might be a red flag. But the author's approach might not be the best either. Maybe she should have tried to understand his perspective first instead of pushing for immediate action. \n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe both have valid points. But since the car is his inheritance, the author might be overstepping by treating it as joint property without his agreement. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she's pushing to sell his asset without considering his feelings or the legal/ownership aspect.\n"
