It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about selling a car to fund a wedding. Let's break it down.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 wants to sell a car that's worth $50k to have a better wedding. They've been engaged over a year but can't save much due to low income. The car is old and unused, inherited by the fianc\u00e9. The author approached the fianc\u00e9 with the idea, but he got upset and wouldn't discuss it. The author feels their assets should be shared and they should have equal say.\n\nFirst, the car is the fianc\u00e9's inheritance. In many places, inheritance is considered separate property unless they are in a common law marriage or have a prenup that changes that. So legally, the car might still belong to him. The author might not have a right to it unless they've pooled assets in a certain way. \n\nBut on an emotional level, the author is trying to plan a wedding. They want it to be special. However, the fianc\u00e9 might have sentimental reasons for keeping the car. Maybe it's a family heirloom with memories. Selling it could be a big deal for him. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author brought it up, but the fianc\u00e9 shut down. That's a problem. Both should communicate and find a compromise. The author might be pushy, not respecting his feelings. The fianc\u00e9 might be dismissive, not listening to her desires. \n\nLegally, the author could be in the right if they're co-owners of the car. But if it's his alone, she can't force him to sell it. Emotionally, both have valid points. The author wants a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 might value the car for reasons beyond money. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? She's trying to use his asset for their mutual goal, but without his consent. If the car is his and he doesn't want to sell it, she can't force him. She might not have considered his feelings or the sentimental value. Hence, she might be in the wrong. But maybe she's justified in wanting a better wedding. It's a tough call. However, since the car is his inheritance and he's not in agreement, pushing to sell it without his consent could be wrong. So, answer A.\n"
