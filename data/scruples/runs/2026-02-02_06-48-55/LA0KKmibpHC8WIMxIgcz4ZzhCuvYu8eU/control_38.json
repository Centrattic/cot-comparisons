It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for suggesting selling her fianc\u00e9's old car to pay for the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They're engaged, but struggling to save enough for a wedding. The fianc\u00e9 has an unused car worth $50k, which the author wants to sell. He's against it and won't discuss it. The author feels they should share assets and decisions, but he's getting angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are shared assets and decision-making in a relationship. In many places, each person owns their own property unless it's considered marital property. Since the car was left to him by his dad, it's probably his personal property. The author wants to use it for the wedding, but he's the one who owns it. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to sell it? Well, she's his fianc\u00e9e, but until they're married, they might not be considered joint owners. The car is his, so she can't just decide to sell it without his consent. However, she's suggesting using it to benefit their shared future, which makes sense. But he has the right to refuse because it's his asset. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from wanting to share assets and decisions, which is reasonable in a committed relationship. But legally and practically, the car is his to dispose of as he wishes. She might not be in the wrong for proposing the idea, but she's overstepping by pressuring him to sell something he owns. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is problematic too, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because she's not in the wrong for suggesting it, as they're planning to share big expenses. However, she might be assuming ownership of his property. But in a relationship, especially when planning a wedding, it's common to discuss such things. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss. However, the author's intent isn't malicious; she wants a better wedding. So maybe she's not wrong. Alternatively, maybe she is, because she's trying to use his property without his full consent. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. I think the answer is B because she's not necessarily wrong to want to use shared resources for their benefit, but the fianc\u00e9's reaction is the bigger problem. So, the answer is B.\n"
