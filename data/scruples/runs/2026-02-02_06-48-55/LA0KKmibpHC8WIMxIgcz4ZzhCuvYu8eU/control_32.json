It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting their fianc\u00e9 sell his old car to fund the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is engaged, been for over a year. They're not saving much because their income is low. The author wants a special wedding, so they found out the fianc\u00e9's unused car is worth $50k. They wanted to sell it, but he's against it and gets angry. The author feels they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nSo, the key points here: shared assets in engagement? Typically, engaged couples aren't legally married, so assets might still be separate unless they're pooling money. The car was inherited, so maybe the fianc\u00e9 has sentimental value or thinks it's his personal property. The author is pushing to sell it without his consent, which could be a boundary issue. Even if they're planning to get married, it's his car until they are legally married. The author might be overstepping by not respecting his decision. On the other hand, they're planning a joint event, so maybe there's a discussion about shared expenses. But selling a car is a big decision, especially if it's not being used. But the fianc\u00e9's right to decide what to do with his inherited property is important. The author's frustration is valid, but pushing without considering his feelings could be wrong. So, answer A (author in the wrong) if they didn't discuss properly or respect his wishes. Answer B (not in the wrong) if they're trying to solve a problem. But since the fianc\u00e9 is against it and she's persistently pushing him, maybe A. Hmm.\n"
