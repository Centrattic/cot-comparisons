It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.

It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for asking their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to pay for the wedding. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The engaged couple has been planning their wedding for over a year but can't save much because their income isn't high. They have enough for a basic wedding, but the author wants it to be special. They found out the fianc\u00e9's unused, old car is worth $50k, so they want to sell it. The fianc\u00e9 is refusing and getting upset when she brings it up. The author feels they should share assets and have equal say, but he's not listening.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Is selling the car a reasonable request? The car is old, unused, and worth a lot. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 values it for sentimental reasons, like it being from his dad. The author wants to use the money for the wedding, which is a shared goal. But the fianc\u00e9 is against it, not engaging in discussion. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author is trying to find a solution they both can agree on, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't open to discussion. The author's reasoning is practical\u2014using an asset to achieve a shared goal. However, the fianc\u00e9 might have emotional attachment. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, even if the car is considered a shared asset, the fianc\u00e9 has the right to have his feelings considered. The author's frustration is valid, but pushing to sell something someone is emotionally attached to without understanding why might be the issue. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nIs the author wrong for suggesting it? Not necessarily. It's a practical idea. But the approach might be wrong if it's dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The problem seems more about the fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss rather than the suggestion itself. The author is trying to solve a shared problem, which is understandable. However, if the car has sentimental value, selling it could be a personal decision for the fianc\u00e9. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is looking for ways to improve their wedding without external debt, which shows initiative. But the fianc\u00e9's resistance might be valid if the car holds personal significance. The author might need to balance practicality with empathy here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible they're not. They're trying to use available resources for a shared goal. However, maybe they didn't consider the emotional value first. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9 isn't engaging in discussion, the fault isn't entirely on the author. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, since the options are yes or no, the correct answer is B.\n"
