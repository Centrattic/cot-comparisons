It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his old car to fund their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is engaged, and they can't afford a big wedding. The fianc\u00e9 has an old car that's been left to him by his dad, which the author found out is worth $50k. The author wants to sell it to pay for the wedding, but he's refusing and getting mad when she brings it up. The author feels they should share assets and have an equal say, but he's not listening.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to decide between A (Yes, author's wrong) or B (No). \n\nLet me consider the points. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his father, so it's his inheritance. That could be a personal asset. The author is suggesting selling it without his consent. Even if they're engaged, they're not legally married yet, so their assets aren't necessarily shared. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the car has sentimental value, even if it's not used. The author is pressuring him to sell something that's his, which he's not comfortable with. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation is to have a memorable wedding, and they can't afford it otherwise. They might feel that since they're about to be married, they should pool resources. But the key here is consent. If the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to sell it, and the author is insisting without respecting his wishes, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the author is framing it as an asset they can share, but until they're married, it's his property. The fact that he gets mad and shuts down the conversation might be a sign that this is a non-negotiable for him, maybe due to family reasons or emotional attachment. The author's frustration is understandable, but pushing for something he's against could strain their relationship. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because she's trying to use his personal asset without his agreement, even if it's for their shared event. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with his inheritance. The author should have discussed it more respectfully and perhaps found another way to fund the wedding. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
