It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sell their fianc\u00e9's unused, valuable car to fund their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have been engaged over a year but can't save enough for a dream wedding. They found out the old car in the garage is worth $50k. The author wants to sell it, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant and gets upset when discussed.\n\nThe question here is about the ethical implications of the author's request. The key factors are the ownership of the car, their shared financial goals, and communication issues. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his father, so it's his personal asset unless it's considered a shared asset now that they're engaged. However, engagement doesn't legally merge assets; marriage does. So, if the car is his, selling it might require his consent.\n\nThe author feels their assets should be shared, but if the car is solely the fianc\u00e9's, then it's his decision. The frustration comes from the fianc\u00e9 not discussing it, which could lead to a lack of compromise. The author's intention is to use the money for a shared event (the wedding), which is understandable, but the fianc\u00e9 might have emotional attachment or other reasons for keeping it.\n\nThe author is pushing for the sale, and the fianc\u00e9 is not open to discussion, which is a problem. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's feelings about the car, especially if it has sentimental value. But the fianc\u00e9 is also wrong for not communicating his reasons and shutting down the conversation. However, the main issue is whether the author has the right to ask to sell an asset that isn't jointly owned. \n\nSince the car is his, the author should respect his decision. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's ownership and feelings. Even if the money is for their mutual benefit, it's his asset. So, the author is probably in the wrong for not respecting his autonomy over his inherited property. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
