It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to fund the wedding. The car is old, unused, and worth a lot. The fianc\u00e9's partner is against it, and the author is frustrated because they feel their assets should be shared, but the partner isn't listening.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects. In many places, if the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his father, it might be considered his personal asset, not a shared one, especially if they're not yet married. Even if they're engaged, joint ownership of assets might not be automatic. So, the author might be assuming shared ownership where it doesn't exist yet. That could be a problem.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The car might have sentimental value to the fianc\u00e9, even if it's not used. The author didn't ask first and just looked it up online. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has reasons not to sell it. The author is pushing hard, leading to arguments. Communication is key here, and it sounds like the author is persistently bringing it up, which might be causing the conflict.\n\nAlso, the wedding budget is tight, and the author wants to use the car's value to have a more special day. But is it fair to pressure a partner to sell an asset they might not be willing to part with? The author's approach might be seen as overstepping, especially if the car is his personal property. Even if they plan to share finances after marriage, pre-marriage decisions require mutual agreement. The author might not be respecting his current ownership, leading to the fianc\u00e9's irritation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to solve a financial problem and sees a solution that the fianc\u00e9 isn't considering. The author's desire for a memorable wedding is understandable. However, the method of approaching it\u2014without prior discussion and assuming shared assets\u2014might be where the issue lies. It's a balance between shared goals and individual property rights.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting the fianc\u00e9's ownership of the car and not having a respectful conversation about it before pushing for its sale. The key points are asset ownership, communication style, and mutual respect in decision-making. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
