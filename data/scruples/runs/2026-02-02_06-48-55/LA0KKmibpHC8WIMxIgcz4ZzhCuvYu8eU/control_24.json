It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell a car her fianc\u00e9 inherited from his dad to fund a more elaborate wedding. They can't afford a big wedding right now, and the car is worth $50k. He's against it, and she feels they should share assets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The car is old, unused, and valuable. She found out its value and wants to sell it. He's upset when she brings it up. She's frustrated because she thinks their assets should be shared and she wants a special wedding. He's not listening, getting angry.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the car is inherited by him, so does she have a right to it? In many places, inherited property is considered separate, even in a marriage. But they're engaged, not married yet. So maybe the ownership is still his. If she's pushing to sell something that's his personal property, that could be an issue. He might feel she's pressuring him to get rid of something sentimental. The car was from his dad, so maybe it has emotional value, not just financial. She's focused on the monetary value, but he might see it differently.\n\nShe wants a better wedding, but is using his inheritance to do so fair? They have savings for a basic wedding, but she wants more. Selling the car would help, but if it's his property, she's asking him to sell something important to him to fund her desires. That might be a conflict of priorities. He might feel she's not respecting his wishes or the sentimental value. The fact that he shuts down discussions and gets angry suggests he's not in a place to talk about it rationally, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, she's trying to plan their future together and sees an opportunity. She might feel that as a fianc\u00e9, they're a team and should share resources. But the car's ownership isn't shared yet. If they're not married, maybe she doesn't have a claim to it. Her frustration is valid if they're working together, but maybe she's overstepping by pressuring him to sell his inheritance. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she's pressuring him to sell his personal property for her wants, and it's his inheritance. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. If the car is his, then she's not wrong for suggesting it, but she might be wrong in pushing him to sell it against his wishes. Since he's not willing to discuss, maybe she's right to want to use the money, but the approach is wrong. Alternatively, if the car has sentimental value, she's not respecting his feelings. So leaning towards A.\n"
