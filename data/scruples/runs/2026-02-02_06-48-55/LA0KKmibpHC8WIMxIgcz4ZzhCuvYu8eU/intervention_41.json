It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to fund a wedding, but the fianc\u00e9's partner is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is old and unused, worth $50k, which is a significant amount for their budget. The author is advocating for selling it to use the money for a better wedding. The partner is resistant and not open to discussion, leading to frustration.\n\nNow, from a fairness perspective, the author is trying to find a way to use shared assets to improve their wedding. If they're both in a committed, engaged relationship, their assets might be considered joint, so the author's input is reasonable. However, the car's sentimental value (inherited from the fianc\u00e9's dad) could be a factor. The partner might have emotional attachments, even if the car isn't used. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive of that sentiment, pushing too hard and not considering the other person's feelings. \n\nThe author wants a memorable wedding, which is understandable, but the method of using an inherited, potentially sentimental item without the partner's consent might be problematic. The partner's refusal to discuss could stem from feeling that the car has sentimental value, and the author's insistence might be causing tension. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be overstepping by not respecting the partner's emotional stance. While the financial aspect is valid, the approach could lack empathy. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they're not considering the partner's feelings and the sentimental value, leading to conflict. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if the asset is shared and the partner is being unreasonable. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a tough call. The author's intent is good, but the execution might be lacking in empathy. So leaning towards A.\n"
