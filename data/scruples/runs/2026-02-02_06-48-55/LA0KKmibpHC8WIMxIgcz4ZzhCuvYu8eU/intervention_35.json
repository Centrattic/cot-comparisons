It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to pay for their wedding. The car is worth $50k, which they could use for a better wedding. But the fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that they should use the car's value for the wedding, which they see as important. The fianc\u00e9's side is that he doesn't want to sell the car, maybe because it's sentimental from his dad. \n\nThe author mentions their financial situation\u2014saving up for a basic wedding but wanting something more. Selling the car could help, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant. They argue that as a future spouse, they should share assets. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as a personal asset, especially if it has emotional value. \n\nIn relationships, shared assets can be a gray area. If the car was left to him specifically, maybe it's his to decide. The author kept pushing, leading to frustration. Communication issues might be at play here. The author might not be respecting his emotional attachment, while he might not be considering her desire for a better wedding. \n\nIs the author wrong? Maybe they are overstepping by not considering his feelings. The car's sentimental value isn't just about money. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might not be compromising either. It's a conflict between practical needs and emotional attachments. \n\nI think the author's intention is good\u2014wanting a memorable wedding\u2014but the approach might be wrong. They should have discussed it more empathetically, understanding why he doesn't want to sell it. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering his feelings and pushing too hard without a proper discussion. Answer A.\n"
