It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who wants to sell an old, unused car worth $50k to pay for a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is frustrated because their partner is refusing to discuss it and getting angry. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. That's a sentimental item, maybe. Even if it's not used, it might hold emotional value. The author found out its value and wants to sell it, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. They're saving for a wedding, but the author wants to prioritize their dream wedding over keeping the car. However, the car is part of the fianc\u00e9's assets. Even though they're engaged, they might not legally share assets yet. So, the author's insistence on selling it without the fianc\u00e9's agreement could be seen as overstepping. \n\nCommunication is key. The author tried to discuss it but the fianc\u00e9 shut down. Maybe the author pushed too hard, causing frustration. The fianc\u00e9's anger might stem from feeling that the car's sentimental value isn't being respected. The author might not realize that the car isn't just money to him, but something inherited. \n\nAlso, the timing of the engagement\u2014saving for a wedding and having financial constraints are real issues. But expecting the fianc\u00e9 to sell a personal item against his will could strain the relationship. The author's approach might be too demanding, not considering the emotional aspect. \n\nSo, while the author's intention is to have a memorable wedding, the method of pressuring the fianc\u00e9 to sell a cherished item without mutual agreement might be the wrong approach. Hence, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
