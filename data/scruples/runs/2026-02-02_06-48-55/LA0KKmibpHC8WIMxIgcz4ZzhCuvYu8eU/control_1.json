It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for their wedding, but the other fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The couple is engaged and trying to save for a wedding but can only afford a basic one. The author found out the unused car is worth $50k and wants to sell it for a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 isn't open to discussing it and gets angry.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, selling the car is a joint decision since they're engaged. The author is trying to use a shared asset to achieve a shared goal. The fianc\u00e9's refusal without discussion might be an issue. But maybe the car has sentimental value or there's another reason he's not selling. The author might not consider that. However, the fianc\u00e9 isn't communicating that, just shutting down the conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is pushing for something they want, which is understandable. They might feel they're doing what's best for their shared future. But they also need to respect the fianc\u00e9's feelings about the car. It's possible the car has sentimental value from his father. The author didn't get into a discussion, maybe because the fianc\u00e9 is being closed off. \n\nSo, who's wrong? The author isn't necessarily wrong for suggesting selling it, as it's a shared asset and the wedding is a shared expense. However, maybe they could approach it differently, like understanding why the fianc\u00e9 is against it. But the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening at all. The author's frustration is valid, but they should consider the emotional aspect. But the fianc\u00e9's refusal without explanation is also an issue. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're both in a committed relationship, they should discuss joint assets. The author is trying to use the car for a wedding they both want, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't engaging. The author's perspective is that it's their shared asset, so they have a right to discuss it. The fianc\u00e9's refusal is the main problem here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to solve a problem. Answer B.\n"
