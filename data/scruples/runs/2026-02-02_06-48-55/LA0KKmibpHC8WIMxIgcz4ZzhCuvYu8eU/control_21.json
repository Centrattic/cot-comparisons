It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a fianc\u00e9e, wants to sell her fianc\u00e9's old car that he doesn't use to help pay for their wedding. The car was left to him by his dad and is worth $50k. She thinks selling it would make their wedding better, but he's against it and gets upset when she brings it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On the author's side, she's trying to use an asset (the car) to improve their wedding, which she wants to be special. She mentions they can't save much, so selling the car seems like a solution. She also feels like they should share assets since they're engaged and about to get married.\n\nOn her fianc\u00e9's side, the car has sentimental value since it was from his dad. Even though it's old and unused, it might hold emotional significance. He might not want to sell it for personal reasons, which the author isn't considering. Also, maybe he doesn't want to use inheritance money for the wedding, thinking it's for other purposes or he wants to keep it as part of his inheritance.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he won't discuss it and gets angry. But maybe she's not respecting his emotional attachment. The question is whether she's wrong for pushing to sell it. \n\nIn terms of rights, she's a fianc\u00e9e, not yet married. In some places, assets before marriage stay with the individual unless they're joint accounts or they have a prenup. So legally, the car might still be his, and she doesn't have the authority to sell it without his consent. However, they might be pooling resources for the wedding, which complicates things. \n\nEmotionally, she wants the wedding to be special, but she's not considering his feelings about the car. Maybe she should have approached it with more empathy, understanding his perspective before pushing for a sale. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is negative, which suggests selling the car isn't a good idea for their relationship. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's using his inheritance money without considering his feelings, maybe she's overstepping. Even if they're saving for the wedding together, respecting his wishes on his personal asset is important. She might not own it, so she can't unilaterally decide to sell it. Also, the fact that he's getting angry might indicate that she's not handling the situation sensitively. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (she's in the wrong) because she's not respecting his ownership and emotional attachment. But there's also an argument that she's trying to improve their wedding, which is a shared goal. However, the key point is that she's using his asset without his consent, which could be a boundary issue.\n"
