It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting selling their fianc\u00e9's inherited car to fund the wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple is engaged for over a year, can't afford a big wedding, and the fianc\u00e9 found out the car is worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 wants to sell it, but the husband is against it. The author is frustrated because they feel like shared assets should be discussed equally, but the husband is getting angry.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about shared assets and respecting each other's values. The car was inherited by the fianc\u00e9, which might mean he has sentimental value attached to it. Even if it's not used, it's his to decide what to do with. The author is pushing to sell it for the wedding, but the husband is against it. \n\nNow, in a relationship, both partners should communicate and compromise. The author might think it's a practical solution, but the husband might value the car for non-monetary reasons. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of his feelings. Also, while they are engaged, they aren't legally married yet, so the ownership of the car might still be his. The author might not have the right to decide to sell it without his consent.\n\nBut the author's intention is to have a better wedding, which is understandable. However, forcing the sale without considering the husband's perspective could be a mistake. It's about balancing practical needs with respecting each other's property and feelings. The author might be in the wrong for not understanding the emotional attachment and pushing too hard without discussion. So maybe answer A.\n"
