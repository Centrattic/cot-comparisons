It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to fund a more elaborate wedding. The fianc\u00e9 found out the car is worth $50k, which is a lot, and she thinks they should sell it. Her partner is against it, and she's frustrated because he's not even discussing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The car is left to him by his father, which might have sentimental value. He might not want to sell it for reasons beyond just the monetary aspect. The author believes their assets should be shared and she has an equal say, which is a valid point in a committed relationship. However, the way she's approaching it seems to be more about getting her way rather than understanding his perspective.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The car is unused but has value. 2) She wants to sell it for the wedding. 3) He's resistant and getting irritated. 4) She's pushing hard, possibly without considering emotional ties.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she's not respecting his feelings about the car, maybe she's the one being unreasonable. Even if assets should be shared, the car might hold personal significance. Also, she's framing the issue as him not listening, but maybe she's not giving him space to explain his reasons. The fact that he's getting mad suggests there's more to his resistance than just financial. The author might be overlooking his emotional attachment or other priorities. So, while wanting a special wedding is understandable, forcing the sale without understanding his side could be where she's wrong. So, answering A makes sense here.\n"
