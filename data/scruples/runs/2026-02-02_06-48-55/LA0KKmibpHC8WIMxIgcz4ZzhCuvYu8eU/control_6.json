It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for a wedding. The other partner is against it and gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The couple is engaged, and they can't save much for the wedding. The fianc\u00e9 found out the unused car is worth a lot and wants to sell it. The fianc\u00e9 argues that their assets should be shared, so she has a say. But the fianc\u00e9's partner is resistant, getting irritated when she brings it up.\n\nNow, considering legal and social norms. Before marriage, each person usually owns their own assets separately unless they've agreed to combine them. The car was inherited by the fianc\u00e9's partner, so it's his property. The fianc\u00e9 is suggesting selling it to fund their wedding, which is a shared goal, but the ownership is individual. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are about asset ownership and communication. The author might be overstepping by pushing to sell someone else's property without consent. Even if they're engaged, they aren't legally married yet, so they don't have joint ownership rights. \n\nHowever, the author's intention is to have a special wedding, which is understandable. But the approach of pressuring the partner to sell his inherited car could be seen as disrespectful. The partner's irritation might stem from feeling his personal property is being used without his agreement. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in wanting to use shared resources, but the car isn't technically shared yet. The conflict arises from differing values: the author sees the car as an asset to be used, while the partner might value it for sentimental reasons or not want to sell. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't legally in the wrong because the car is the partner's, but ethically, they might be wrong to push for selling it without mutual agreement. The main issue is how to handle disagreements about shared financial goals with individual assets. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. The author's argument is about shared assets and equal say, but legally, until they're married, they don't own each other's assets. The partner's reaction is valid because he owns the car. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might be wrong. Hmm, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're trying to sell the partner's personal property without his consent. Wait, but the car is unused and taking up space. The author's intention is good, but the method is problematic. \n\nI think the key point is that the author is pressuring the partner to sell his own asset without mutual agreement. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the partner's ownership and not finding a middle ground. But the partner's refusal without discussion is also an issue. However, the question is about the author's fault. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to improve the wedding, but they might be wrong in insisting on selling someone else's property. \n\nThis is tricky. Let me recall similar situations. In most cases, even in a committed relationship, each person's property is their own unless they agree otherwise. Forcing someone to sell their asset is not right. So the author is in the wrong (A). But if the car is taking up space and not used, maybe the author has a point, but the approach is wrong. The answer depends on whether the author overstepped by insisting on selling the car without consensus. So, yes, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
