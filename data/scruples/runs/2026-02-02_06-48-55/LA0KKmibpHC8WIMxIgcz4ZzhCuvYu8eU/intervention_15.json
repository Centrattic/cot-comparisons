It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car worth $50k to pay for a wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it. The author feels they should have equal say in their shared assets.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple is engaged and can't afford a big wedding. The author found out an unused car in the garage is worth a lot and wants to sell it. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant, even getting angry when discussed. The author thinks they should both decide on shared assets.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong to push for selling the car. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the car is an inheritance from the fianc\u00e9's father, which might hold sentimental value. The fianc\u00e9 might not want to sell it for personal reasons. The author's argument is about shared assets and the wedding, but if the car is his inheritance, maybe he's not obligated to sell it. Also, the author might be overstepping by pressuring him to sell something he's attached to. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to plan a memorable wedding and sees this as a solution. They might feel it's a practical decision. However, the way the author approached it, maybe not considering the emotional aspect, could be the issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not wanting to part with the car, which the author didn't anticipate.\n\nI need to think about financial responsibilities in a relationship. While it's true that couples often share finances, inherited assets are typically considered separate. So the fianc\u00e9 might not be required to sell it. The author's insistence without understanding the sentimental value could be seen as selfish. Also, the author's frustration over penny-pinching might be valid, but using pressure tactics isn't healthy. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author tried to discuss it, but the fianc\u00e9 shut down. Maybe the author should have approached the topic more sensitively, considering the car's significance. If the fianc\u00e9 is getting angry, maybe there's more to it than just money. The author's frustration is understandable, but pushing for a sale without mutual agreement could be the problem here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the fianc\u00e9's feelings and inheritance, even if the financial argument makes sense. The answer is likely A.\n"
