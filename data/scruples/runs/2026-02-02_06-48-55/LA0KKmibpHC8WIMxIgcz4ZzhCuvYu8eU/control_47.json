It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting that their fianc\u00e9 sell an old car worth $50k to fund a more elaborate wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been engaged for over a year and can only afford a basic wedding. The author wants it to be special. The car is their dad's inheritance, unused, and taking up space. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant and gets irritated when the topic comes up. \n\nSo, the main points here are about shared assets and the right to decide how to use them. The author believes that as a fianc\u00e9, they should have equal say in their assets. The fianc\u00e9, however, seems to be against selling the car, maybe for sentimental reasons or other financial considerations.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, selling an asset to fund a wedding can be a valid argument, especially if they're struggling to save. However, the key here is communication. The fianc\u00e9 is not open to discussing it and gets angry. The author is pushing the issue because they want the wedding to be better, but maybe they didn't consider why the car is important to him. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the car is useless and they need the money. But the fianc\u00e9 might have emotional attachment to the vehicle, even if it's old. The question is whether the author is overstepping by insisting on selling it without understanding his perspective. \n\nIn terms of shared assets, once engaged, there's an expectation of joint decision-making, but the car was left to him specifically. Ownership might be a factor. If it's his personal property, the author might not have the right to demand its sale unless they have a mutual agreement. \n\nAlso, the author is framing it as a way to make the wedding special, but maybe the fianc\u00e9 has other priorities. It's possible that the car's value is more in the emotional aspect than monetary. The author didn't mention discussing any other alternatives for funding the wedding, which could be a problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to use the car's value for the wedding, but the approach might be. Pressing the issue without considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and reasons for keeping the car could be the issue. The answer might be a middle ground where the author's intent is understandable, but their method is flawed. \n\nBut according to the AITA rules, the answer is either A or B. If the author's request is reasonable, then B (not in the wrong). If the request is overstepping, then A (in the wrong). \n\nSince the car is unused and potentially a valuable asset, using it to fund the wedding could be seen as a practical decision. However, the fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment might be a factor. The author's insistence without proper discussion might be the problem. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether selling the car is a joint decision. If the car is his, then maybe the author is in the wrong for pressuring him to sell it without mutual agreement. But if they consider their assets as shared, regardless of ownership, then the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, even if one person owns an asset, major decisions about selling it should be mutual, especially when planning a wedding. The author's frustration is valid, but the fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss it is problematic. However, the author might be assuming ownership of the car as part of their shared future, which the fianc\u00e9 doesn't agree with. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author's motivation is to have a better wedding, and the car isn't being used. But the approach is aggressive, leading to conflict. However, the AITA community often looks at intent and circumstances. If the author is trying to get a better wedding and the car is a dead asset, then their request is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's refusal without discussion is the main issue here. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the fianc\u00e9 is the one being unreasonable. So answer B.\n"
