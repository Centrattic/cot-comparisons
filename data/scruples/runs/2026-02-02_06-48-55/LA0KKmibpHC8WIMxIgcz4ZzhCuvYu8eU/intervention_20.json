It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell a car left by the groom's father to help fund a more elaborate wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is engaged, has been for over a year, and can't afford a big wedding. They have enough for a basic one, but the fianc\u00e9e wants something special. The car is old, unused, and worth $50k. She suggests selling it, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset and refuses to discuss it. She feels they should share assets and have equal say, but he's not listening.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not wrong). \n\nLet me break it down. The car was a gift to the fianc\u00e9 from his dad. That makes it his personal property unless they are in a common law or community property state. In many places, unless they are married or have joint ownership, the car remains his. So, she might not have a legal claim to it. But emotionally, it's a sentimental item for him. He might feel it's part of his inheritance and wants to keep it. \n\nHer argument is about shared assets and equal say. But if the car isn't jointly owned, she might not have a right to decide its fate. However, they are planning a wedding, which they'll share, so she might feel it's for both of them. \n\nCommunication is a big issue here. She wants to discuss it, but he shuts her down. That's a problem in the relationship. But is selling the car her right? If it's his car, she can't force him to sell it. She's using emotional pressure, which might be wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, she's trying to improve their wedding experience, which is a shared goal. Maybe he feels she's not respecting his wishes or the sentimental value. \n\nI think the main point is whether she has the right to ask him to sell his personal property. If it's his, she's overstepping. But if they're in a shared financial situation, maybe she's justified. However, the fact that he's upset and she presses further without considering his feelings might make her wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A. She's in the wrong because she's pressuring him to sell his inherited property without considering his emotional attachment and the legal ownership. Even if the goal is good, the method is problematic.\n"
