It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.

It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to sell her fianc\u00e9's old car to fund a more elaborate wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is engaged for over a year, saving for a basic wedding, but the author wants something special. The car is old, unused, and worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 is against selling it, even shutting down the conversation, which is causing frustration.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for suggesting selling the car. The fianc\u00e9's car was left to him by his father. Even if it's not used, it's a personal item with sentimental value. The author might not realize the emotional weight the car has for him. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be about more than money\u2014he could be attached to it.\n\nFinancial responsibility is another angle. The author sees the car as an asset to be liquidated for their shared goal, the wedding. But the fianc\u00e9 might see it as a personal asset, not a shared one yet. Since they're not married, the car is his until they merge their finances. The author's argument about shared assets is valid post-marriage, but pre-marriage, it's his property.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author is bringing up a valid point about using available resources, but the fianc\u00e9 is refusing to discuss it, which is a problem. However, the author's persistence might be seen as pressure, especially if he's not open to negotiation. The question is whether her request is reasonable or if she's overstepping.\n\nAlso, the car's value is $50k, which is a significant amount. The author wants to use it for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 might have other plans or see it as a family heirloom. The author's frustration is understandable, but she needs to respect his decision if it's non-negotiable. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to discuss it.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to use the money for the wedding, as it's a shared future goal. However, the fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with his personal property. The problem is the lack of dialogue and mutual understanding. The author's approach might be seen as pushy, but her intentions are about their shared future. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to communicate is also a problem. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for proposing a practical solution to fund their wedding, especially if they plan to merge assets. However, the situation highlights a communication breakdown rather than a clear-cut right or wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
