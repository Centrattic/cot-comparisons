It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author wanting to sell her fianc\u00e9's old car to fund a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, and the author feels he's not considering her input.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The car was inherited by the fianc\u00e9 and isn't used. The author found out it's worth a lot and wants to sell it for the wedding. They've been engaged over a year, saving for a basic ceremony but want it to be special. The fianc\u00e9 is refusing to discuss it, getting angry.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. The car is his inheritance, so unless they have joint ownership or a prenup that shares assets, it might be his to decide. However, they're engaged and planning a shared future, so there's an expectation of joint decision-making. But does that extend to his personal property?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that their assets should be shared, but the car is his personal asset. Even in a relationship, unless there's a legal agreement, inherited property typically remains separate. So, selling it might require his consent. The author is pushing for it without his agreement, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to improve the wedding they're both planning, which is a shared goal. They might feel they have a say in major expenses. But the fianc\u00e9's refusal could be due to sentimental value, not just financial reasons. The car might hold emotional significance from his father, which the author didn't consider.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but using his inheritance without his consent might be disrespectful. The key here is whether the car is a shared asset or his personal property. If it's his alone, she can't force him to sell it. However, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe she should have discussed it more sensitively, considering his feelings and reasons for wanting to keep it.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to use the money for the wedding, but she's not the owner of the car. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with his inherited property. Her insistence without respecting his ownership could be the issue. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because she's pressuring him to sell his personal asset without his agreement.\n"
