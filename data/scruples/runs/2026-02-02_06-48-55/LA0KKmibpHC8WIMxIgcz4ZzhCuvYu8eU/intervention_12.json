It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his old car to fund a better wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been engaged over a year, saving for a basic wedding but want something more. The fianc\u00e9 has a car from his dad that's unused and worth $50k. She suggests selling it, but he's against it and gets angry. She feels they should share assets and her wants are unreasonable.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that the car isn't used, it's an asset they could share, and selling it would help their wedding. The fianc\u00e9's side is that it's a sentimental item from his dad, maybe he has emotional attachment, or maybe he doesn't want to sell it for some other reason.\n\nBut the key points here: The car is his personal property, inherited from his father. Even if they're engaged, in many places, until they are married and have joint ownership, the car is his. She might not have the right to demand he sell it. Also, the engagement is about to turn into marriage, but until then, they're separate individuals with separate assets. \n\nShe's trying to use his asset for their shared goal, but without his consent. That could be seen as overstepping. Even if they plan to share finances later, during the engagement, they might still have separate possessions. So she's not necessarily in the wrong for suggesting it, but maybe in the wrong for pressuring him if he's against it. \n\nAlso, the way he's reacting\u2014shutting her down and getting angry\u2014could indicate there's more to the story. Maybe the car has sentimental value, or he has other plans for it. If she's dismissing his feelings and pushing hard, that's a problem. But if he's being unreasonable without explanation, maybe she's justified. However, since she's asking him to sell something he owns, she's overstepping. \n\nSo probably answer A: the author is in the wrong because she's trying to use his personal property without considering his reasons for keeping it and their engagement status might not justify shared asset decisions yet.\n"
