It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9 not wanting to sell a car he inherited to help pay for their wedding. The author is frustrated because they can't afford a big wedding and found out the car is worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 is against selling it and gets angry when she brings it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that since they're engaged and planning to marry, their assets should be shared. She wants to use the car's value to have a better wedding. She's justified in wanting to use shared resources for their future together. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 inherited the car from his father, which might hold sentimental value. Even if it's not used, maybe selling it feels like giving up on his father's legacy. Plus, he might not want to sell his assets to contribute to the wedding, especially if he feels it's his to decide.\n\nThe key points here are about shared assets in a pre-marital relationship. Legally, in many places, unless they are married, assets like an inherited car might still be considered separate. So the fianc\u00e9 might have the right to decide what to do with it. The author is assuming joint ownership, but if it's an inheritance, that might not be the case. Also, communication is a big issue here. The fianc\u00e9 is shutting down the conversation and getting angry, which is not healthy. But the author is pushing hard for something that the fianc\u00e9 is emotionally attached to.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, wanting a memorable wedding. But she might not be respecting his feelings about the car. Maybe there's a middle ground, like keeping the car but using other funds, or discussing other ways to raise money. However, the author is insistent on selling it, which could be seen as pressuring him. In relationships, both partners need to have equal say, but if one asset isn't shared, the other can't force the sale. So the author might be in the wrong for expecting him to sell something he inherited without his consent. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
