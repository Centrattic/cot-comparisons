It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for suggesting selling the car to pay for the wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they can't afford a big wedding and found out the old car is worth a lot. The fianc\u00e9 wants to sell it, but the other partner is against it and got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, so it's his personal property unless it's considered a marital asset. Depending on the jurisdiction, assets acquired before marriage might be separate, but once engaged, things can get complicated. However, in many places, pre-marriage assets remain separate unless there's a community property state. So maybe the fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with his inherited car.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship. The author is trying to plan a wedding they can afford, which is understandable. But expecting their partner to sell a sentimental or inherited item without considering their feelings might be an issue. The fianc\u00e9 might have emotional attachment to the car, even if it's unused. The author didn't consider that and pushed the idea, leading to conflict.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 shut down the conversation and got angry. Maybe there's more to the story\u2014like the car isn't just a car but has sentimental value. The author's approach might have been too forceful, not respecting the fianc\u00e9's feelings. Even if assets are shared, communication and mutual agreement are essential. The author might be right in wanting the wedding they want, but the method of pressuring the sale without discussion could be wrong.\n\nAnother angle: financial planning. They have enough for a basic wedding, which might be a more realistic approach. The car's value could be a solution, but if selling it causes major stress, maybe there are other ways to fund the wedding. The author didn't explore alternatives and is fixated on this one solution, possibly not respecting the fianc\u00e9's wishes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be overstepping by not respecting the fianc\u00e9's ownership and feelings about the car. They should have had a more thoughtful discussion instead of pushing for a sale. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong.\n"
