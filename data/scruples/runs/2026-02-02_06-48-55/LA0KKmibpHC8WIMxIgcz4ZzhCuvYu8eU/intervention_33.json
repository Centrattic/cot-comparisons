It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting selling a car left to her fianc\u00e9 by his father to fund a more elaborate wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant and getting angry. The author feels they should have shared control over assets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The car was inherited by the fianc\u00e9, so technically, it's his asset unless they are in a common-law or marital property state where assets are shared. But since they're engaged, not yet married, it's likely his personal property. The author might not have legal claim over it.\n\nEthically, the author wants to use the car to improve their wedding, which she sees as important. But the fianc\u00e9 values the car for sentimental reasons. The author is pushing to sell it, which he resents. The key points are respect for personal property, communication, and compromise. \n\nIs the author wrong? She's trying to use shared assets for a common goal, but the car isn't shared if it's solely his. However, as a fianc\u00e9e, she might expect collaboration. But pushing to sell without considering his feelings could be seen as overstepping. The fianc\u00e9's right to refuse is important here. The author might not be wrong in wanting to plan a better wedding, but she might be wrong in not respecting his ownership and the sentimental value. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author overstepped by not considering his feelings and the car's significance to him. If the car has sentimental value and she's dismissing that, she's in the wrong. If she's just trying to use an asset they could share, maybe not. But since it's his inheritance, she might be wrong in expecting him to sell it without mutual agreement.\n"
