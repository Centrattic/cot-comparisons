It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for a wedding, but the other fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple is engaged, been saving for a year but can only afford a barebones wedding. The author found out the unused car is worth $50k and wants to sell it for a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and refuses to discuss it, getting irritated.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. So it's his inheritance. The author is suggesting selling a personal asset that might have sentimental value. Even if it's not used, the owner has the right to decide its fate. The author is pressuring him to sell it, which could be seen as respecting his wishes or as being selfish. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they should share assets and have an equal say. But in many relationships, especially pre-marriage, individuals might still own separate assets. The fianc\u00e9 might not want to sell due to sentimental reasons, not just financial. The author is trying to use the car for a wedding, which is a shared goal, but the method might be problematic.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, pushing to sell an inherited item without the other person's consent could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's against their wishes. The fianc\u00e9 not wanting to discuss it might be a red flag for communication issues, but the author is also not respecting his decision. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting his fianc\u00e9's feelings about his inherited property. The answer might be A.\n"
