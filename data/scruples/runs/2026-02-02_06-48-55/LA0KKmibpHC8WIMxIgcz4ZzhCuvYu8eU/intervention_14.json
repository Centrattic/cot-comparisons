It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to help pay for their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is engaged for over a year, saving for a basic wedding. The fianc\u00e9 has an old car worth $50k that's not used. The author suggests selling it to fund a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 gets angry and refuses to discuss. The author feels they should have equal say in shared assets.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. Legally, until they're married, the car is his personal property, right? Even though they're engaged, they might not have joint ownership yet. So the author might not have the legal right to decide to sell it, unless they're in a common law state where assets become shared after a certain period. But since they're engaged and not married, maybe the fianc\u00e9's asset is his to decide. \n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated because they want a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is set against selling the car. The author feels their input should be considered, but the fianc\u00e9 is shutting them down. The car's sentimental value could be a factor. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has a connection to it from his father, making it hard to sell regardless of the financial benefits. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they need money for the wedding and the car is unused. But the fianc\u00e9's refusal could be based on emotional reasons. The author might not realize the car's sentimental value, leading to a clash. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to solve a financial problem by using available assets, but maybe without considering the other person's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is within his rights to refuse, and the author's insistence without respecting his feelings could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the car is his to decide, then yes, pushing to sell without his consent could be wrong. The author should have discussed it more sensitively, considering the emotional aspect. Alternatively, if the couple is a team, maybe they should both agree on major financial decisions. But legally and emotionally, the fianc\u00e9 might have valid reasons. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his stance and pressuring him.\n"
