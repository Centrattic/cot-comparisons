It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to pay for the wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're engaged, saving for a wedding but only have enough for a basic one. The fianc\u00e9 has an old, unused car worth $50k that he inherited. The author suggests selling it, but he refuses and gets angry. She feels they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On the author's side, she wants a memorable wedding and sees the car as a resource. They're in a committed relationship, so maybe shared finances make sense. But the fianc\u00e9 might value the car for sentimental reasons or not want to sell it. He might feel it's his personal property, inherited from his dad, and not something they should discuss selling for a wedding.\n\nThe key points are shared assets in a relationship. If they're engaged and planning to marry, it's reasonable to expect joint decision-making. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as his personal inheritance, not a shared asset yet. The author's approach could be seen as pressuring him to use his personal property without his consent, which might be where she's wrong. Conversely, if they're pooling resources for the wedding, she's justified in wanting to use available assets.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is shutting down and getting angry, which is not helpful. But does that make the author right? Maybe not. Maybe she needs to respect his feelings about the car. The car might have sentimental value, which the author didn't consider. Selling it could be a big emotional decision for him, not just a financial one.\n\nSo the question is whether the author overstepped by pressuring him to sell something he inherited. If the car is his personal property, even in a relationship, he might have the right to decide its fate. The author might not be in the wrong if they're planning to merge finances, but she might have approached it without considering his feelings. The fianc\u00e9's refusal is his right, but the author's intention is to improve their wedding. It's a balance between shared goals and individual possessions.\n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B (No), because she's trying to use a shared resource to benefit their future together. But if the car is his personal inheritance, then she might not have the right to demand it. The line is blurry. The fianc\u00e9's inheritance could be considered his personal asset unless they agreed otherwise. So pressing him to sell it without his consent could be wrong. But if they're planning a joint wedding, maybe it's fair to discuss using shared assets. However, if the car is his personal asset, she's overstepping. So maybe A (Yes, she's wrong).\n"
