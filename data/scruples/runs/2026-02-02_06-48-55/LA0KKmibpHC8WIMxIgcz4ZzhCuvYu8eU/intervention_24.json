It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for suggesting their fianc\u00e9 sell an old car to fund their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 has a car worth $50k that's unused and inherited. The author wants to sell it to have a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and shared assets. Since they're engaged and planning to get married, they might be in a common-law or shared asset situation. However, inherited property can be tricky. If the car is solely the fianc\u00e9's inheritance, maybe it's his alone unless they've already agreed to share assets. The author might assume it's shared, but the fianc\u00e9 might see it as his personal property. \n\nThen there's the matter of communication. The author says he shuts her down and gets irritated. That's a red flag for communication problems. But is the author wrong for wanting to use the car's value? She has a valid reason\u2014wanting a memorable wedding. However, selling a family heirloom might have sentimental value, even if it's not used. The fianc\u00e9's resistance could be due to emotional attachment, not just financial reasons.\n\nThe author's approach might be confrontational. She mentions pushing the issue, leading to frustration. Maybe she should have discussed it more calmly or considered other ways to fund the wedding. But her desire for a special day is understandable. \n\nSo, is she wrong? She's not entirely in the wrong because she's trying to plan their future. But she might have a point in wanting to use shared resources. However, if the car is his inheritance, she shouldn't unilaterally decide to sell it without mutual agreement. The problem is both sides have valid points, but the author might be overstepping if she's pressuring him to sell something he values. So maybe the answer is A, but it's a bit nuanced.\n"
