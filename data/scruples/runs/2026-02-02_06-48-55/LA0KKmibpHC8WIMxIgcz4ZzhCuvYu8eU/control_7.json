That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.

It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his old car to help pay for their wedding. So first, let's break down the situation.\n\nThe couple is engaged and has been for over a year. They're struggling to save enough for a wedding they want to be special. The author found out that the fianc\u00e9's unused car, left by his father, is worth $50k. She suggests selling it, but he gets upset and refuses to discuss it.\n\nNow, to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On her side: they're working together towards a shared goal (their wedding), and she's trying to find a solution to make it better. She's not in a position to force him, but she's proposing using an asset he's not using. She wants input on shared assets, which is valid since they're planning to be married.\n\nOn his side: the car was a gift from his father, which might have sentimental value beyond monetary. He might feel that selling it is disrespectful to his dad's memory. Also, even though they're engaged, he might not see it as a shared asset yet. He has the right to decide what to do with personal property, unless there's a legal agreement otherwise. His frustration shows he might feel pressured or that she's not respecting his attachment to the car.\n\nThe key points here are ownership of the car and emotional value. Since the car was given to him, it's his property. Even as fianc\u00e9s, they might not have a legal claim over each other's belongings unless they're married. The author's argument about shared assets is reasonable in the context of marriage, but not necessarily legal yet. Emotionally, he's upset because selling the car might mean losing something meaningful. The author's frustration is about wanting to use available resources for their shared future, but maybe she didn't consider his feelings about the car.\n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, she's not in the wrong if she's suggesting selling an asset she considers shared. However, emotionally, she might not have approached it with enough sensitivity. But since they're engaged, both should be considering each other's perspectives. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss it is also problematic. The author's insistence without understanding his stance could be seen as a misstep, but she's also advocating for their future together.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No), because she's trying to solve a problem they both care about (the wedding). But the nuance is that she might not have considered the sentimental value. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the car is purely his and he has a valid reason not to sell it, then she's not wrong for suggesting it, even if he doesn't want to. Since they're not married yet, he has the right to his property. So the author isn't in the wrong for making the suggestion, but she might need to approach it differently. Therefore, answer B.\n"
