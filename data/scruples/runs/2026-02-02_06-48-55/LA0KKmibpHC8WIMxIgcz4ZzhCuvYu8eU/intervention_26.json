It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the original question is in the wrong. The scenario is about selling an old car to fund a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9 has a car from his dad that's not used. The author found out it's worth $50k and wants to sell it for the wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are: financial planning for the wedding, ownership of the car, and communication between the couple. The author argues that shared assets should be discussed equally and that the car is unused. The fianc\u00e9 isn't cooperating, which is causing friction.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider why. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his father. That might have sentimental value. Selling it could be a personal decision for him. Even if the couple is engaged, the car might still be his asset until marriage. They might not be legally considered as sharing assets yet. \n\nThe author is pushing to sell it without considering the emotional attachment. It's possible the fianc\u00e9 values the car more than monetarily. The author is frustrated but might not realize the car's significance. \n\nAlso, the author is using pressure tactics, bringing it up repeatedly and causing tension. Effective communication is about mutual respect, not pushing until the other person gets angry. The author might not be considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings or the car's importance to him.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, maybe the author is overstepping. They should have had a more sensitive discussion about the car's value beyond money. The fianc\u00e9's right to his inheritance and feelings about it should be respected. The author wants to use shared assets, but if it's his personal property, she might not have equal say yet.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author in the wrong) because she's disregarding his feelings and the car's sentimental value, using pressure tactics, and possibly overstepping ownership boundaries.\n"
