It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the fianc\u00e9 should sell an old car that's worth $50k to help pay for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't use the car and it's just taking up space. The author thinks they should sell it, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it and isn't even discussing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership of the car. The car was left to him by his dad. So, it's his inheritance. Even though they're engaged and planning to get married, legally the car is his until they tie the knot. Once they're married, maybe it becomes a shared asset, but before that, he might have sole ownership. That could mean he has the right to decide what to do with it, even if the author disagrees.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The couple isn't saving enough for a big wedding. The author wants a special day, but they can only afford a basic one now. The car is a potential source of funds. But the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to discuss it. The author feels like they should have equal say in shared assets, but if the car isn't technically shared yet, maybe that's a point of contention.\n\nCommunication issues are also present. The author says the fianc\u00e9 shuts down the conversation and gets irritated. That's not a good sign. Healthy communication is important in a relationship. If the author keeps pushing and it leads to arguments, that's a problem. But the author's motivation is to improve the wedding, which is a shared event. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has emotional attachment to the car, even if it's not used. Inheritances can have sentimental value, so selling it might mean parting with a family heirloom, which could be a sensitive issue.\n\nAnother angle: the timing. Planning a wedding can be stressful, and financial disagreements can strain a relationship. The author's frustration is understandable, but so is the fianc\u00e9's refusal to sell something he values. It's about balancing practicality and emotions. If the car is a symbol of the past for him, selling it might be a big deal, even if it's not used. The author might not realize the emotional weight behind the car.\n\nIs the author wrong for suggesting selling it? If the car is his personal property and he doesn't want to sell it, then maybe the author is overstepping by pressuring him. Even if it's a shared asset in the future, during the engagement, individual assets might still be separate. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his right to decide. But if they're planning a joint wedding, maybe it's fair to consider shared expenses. However, the fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss it is a problem, but the author's approach could be part of the issue. Maybe the author should have approached it differently, but the question is whether they're in the wrong overall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because they're trying to make the wedding better for both of them, but they need to respect his ownership. The answer depends on the relationship dynamics and the legal status of the car. If the car is his separately, then the author can't be blamed for suggesting selling it, but the fianc\u00e9 has every right to refuse. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for suggesting it, but the way they approached it might be an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), because they're trying to solve a financial problem, but they might not have the right to demand he sell his personal property. But some might argue that since they're planning a joint event, it's fair to use shared resources. But if the car is separate, then maybe the author is in the wrong. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the key here is that the car is his inheritance, so it's his decision. The author is in a position where they want to use his property without his consent, which could be wrong. So maybe answer A (Yes), but I'm not sure. Wait, but the author's intention is to help with the wedding, which they both want to have. So maybe they're not wrong, but the fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable. The answer might be B (No). I'm a bit confused. Need to weigh the ownership versus the shared goal. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to discuss it is also a problem. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they have a valid reason, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't being reasonable. So answer B.\n"
