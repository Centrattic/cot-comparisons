It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting selling their fianc\u00e9's old car to pay for the wedding. So first, I need to consider both sides here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want a special wedding, but they can't afford it. The fianc\u00e9 has this unused car that's worth a lot, and the author thinks selling it would help. However, the fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets upset whenever the topic comes up. The author feels that as a fianc\u00e9, they should have equal say over shared assets.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have emotional attachment to the car, since it was left by his dad. The author didn't consider that emotional value and just focused on the monetary aspect. Jumping to sell it without discussing it properly could have been disrespectful. The author also mentions that the fianc\u00e9 isn't open to discussion, which might mean he has valid reasons for not wanting to sell.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. Even if the car is a shared asset, the fianc\u00e9's feelings about it matter. The author acted based on their own desire without fully understanding his perspective. Maybe they could have approached it differently, like exploring other options for the wedding or finding a compromise. Selling the car might not be the only solution, and there's a lack of negotiation here.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect their fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment and pushed too hard without considering other possibilities. They should have had a more open conversation and tried to understand his reasons before insisting on selling the car.\n"
