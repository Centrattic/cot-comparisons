It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his old, unused car to pay for their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're engaged for over a year and can't save much for the wedding because they don't earn enough. The author wants a special wedding, not just barebones. She found out the car he inherited is worth $50k, so she suggests selling it. But he's resistant, gets mad when she brings it up. She feels their assets should be shared and she should have a say, but he's not listening.\n\nNow, the key points here. The car was left to him by his dad, so it's his inheritance. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless they have a prenup that combines assets. Since they're not married yet, maybe they don't have a prenup. So selling an inherited asset might be his decision unless they agreed otherwise. \n\nThe author is trying to use this asset for the wedding, which is a joint expense. But does that mean he has to sell it? Maybe she's assuming joint ownership without considering that it's his personal property. He might value the car for sentimental reasons, even if it's unused. The fact that he's getting irritated suggests there's more than just financial reasons involved\u2014maybe emotional attachment. \n\nAlso, communication is a big part of relationships. She's trying to push him to sell it, but he's not open to discussion. Maybe she's not respecting his emotional connection to the car. Even if the car is valuable, forcing him to sell something sentimental could cause more conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the wedding is a shared expense, and maybe she's trying to find a solution to make it special. But is it fair to pressure him to part with a family heirloom without his consent? The author might not realize that the car isn't just an asset to him. It's possible he's worried about family expectations or his own feelings about the inheritance.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because she's not acknowledging that the car is his personal inheritance and that he has the right to decide its fate. Even though they're engaged, until they're married, assets might still be separate unless they've agreed otherwise. Forcing the sale without his consent and getting frustrated when he resists could be seen as overstepping. She should have discussed it more carefully, respecting his ownership and feelings about the car.\n"
