It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9e wanting to sell her fianc\u00e9's old car to fund their wedding. The car is unused, inherited, and potentially worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 is against selling it, and the author feels frustrated because he won't discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The car is owned by the fianc\u00e9, inherited from his father. Even though they're engaged and planning a shared future, legally, until they are married, their assets are separate. The fianc\u00e9 inherited the car, so he likely has sole ownership. The author is suggesting using it for the wedding, but he's not agreeing.\n\nThe author argues that since they're engaged, their assets should be shared, and she has an equal say. However, in most legal systems, engagement doesn't merge assets unless they're married. So the car is still his, and he has the right to decide what to do with it. The author is pressuring him to sell it, which he's uncomfortable with. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment to the car might be a factor. Even if it's old and unused, it's a family heirloom from his father. Selling it could be a big decision for him, and he might not want to part with it for sentimental reasons. The author might not be considering his feelings here, pushing for a solution that's financially motivated but overlooks emotional value.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, wanting a special wedding. But assuming they can use the car's value without his consent might be overstepping. She has a right to her opinion, but he has the right to his own asset. They need to find a compromise. However, the author is framing this as a shared asset and demanding he sells it, which might not respect his ownership.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his ownership and emotional attachment, pushing him to make a decision he's not comfortable with. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
