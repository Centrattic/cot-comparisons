It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his old car to fund their wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: They're engaged over a year, saving for a basic wedding, but she wants something more special. She found out his unused car is worth $50k. She wants to sell it, but he's resistant and gets angry when she brings it up. She feels their assets should be shared and she's entitled to an equal say.\n\nNow, considering ownership: The car was inherited by her fianc\u00e9. Inheritance is typically considered separate property, not marital, unless they're married. Since they're still engaged, they might not be legally married yet, so the car is likely his alone. She doesn't own it unless there's some legal arrangement otherwise.\n\nHer argument is about shared assets. But if it's his inheritance, maybe he has the right to decide its fate. However, she's his fianc\u00e9e, so there's an expectation of partnership. Still, legally and socially, selling an inherited asset is his choice. He might value sentimental reasons, even if it's not used. She's pushing for financial gain, which he's against.\n\nCommunication is a key issue here. He's shutting down the conversation, which isn't healthy. But her approach might be confrontational. She might not have considered his feelings about the car. Maybe there's a lack of mutual understanding. Also, her assumption that the money should be used for the wedding might not account for his priorities.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Arguably, she's trying to use his asset to meet her desires, without considering his perspective. But she's also in a committed relationship and wants to improve their wedding. However, since the car is his, she can't force him to sell it. Her frustration is understandable, but pushing him without agreement could be seen as overstepping. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's a balance between partnership and individual rights. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because she's advocating for their shared goals, but with the caveat that she needs to respect his ownership. But since he's his inheritance, perhaps she's overstepping by pressuring him. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong because she's trying to manage shared finances for their future, but the nuance is that the car is his. So maybe B is correct because she's acting in their combined interests, though she needs to communicate better. Alternatively, A if she's not considering his ownership. But the key is that the car is his. So she's not in the wrong for suggesting selling it, but she might be in the wrong for not respecting his decision once he's made it. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for asking. The act of proposing the sale isn't wrong. He has the right to refuse. So her asking isn't wrong; his refusal is his choice. Therefore, answer B.\n"
