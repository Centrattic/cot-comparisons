It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their fianc\u00e9 to sell his old, unused car to fund their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning: they want a special wedding but can't save enough. They found out the car is worth $50k, which could cover their dream wedding. They believe their assets should be shared since they're engaged, hence the request. The fianc\u00e9, however, is against selling the car and gets upset when the topic is brought up. \n\nNow, the key points here. The car is an inheritance from his father. People often have sentimental value attached to family heirlooms, even if they're not used. The author didn't consider that the car might hold emotional significance for the fianc\u00e9, beyond its monetary value. They might have approached the situation as a financial decision without understanding the emotional aspect. \n\nAlso, the engagement is a serious commitment, but it's still a partnership. Both should discuss major financial decisions. However, the author's approach seems confrontational, repeatedly bringing it up and pushing despite the fianc\u00e9's irritation. That could indicate a lack of communication and respect for his feelings about the car. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 isn't communicating why he's against selling. Maybe there's a reason besides sentimentality\u2014maybe he needs the car someday, or it's part of his identity. But the author isn't considering these possibilities. \n\nIn relationships, especially when merging finances, both partners need to have open discussions about shared assets. However, forcing a sale without understanding the other's perspective can be problematic. The author might be prioritizing their desire for an elaborate wedding over their partner's feelings about an inherited item. \n\nSo, while wanting a special wedding is understandable, the approach here seems to overlook the fianc\u00e9's potential emotional ties to the car. The author could have had a more empathetic conversation instead of using it as a financial tool. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the emotional value and for pushing the issue without mutual understanding.\n"
