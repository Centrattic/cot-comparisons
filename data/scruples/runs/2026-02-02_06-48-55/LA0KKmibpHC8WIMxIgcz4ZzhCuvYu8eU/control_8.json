It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong here. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old, unused car that's worth $50k to pay for a more elaborate wedding. The fianc\u00e9 found out the car's value and suggested selling it, but the other person got upset and wouldn't discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They're engaged, so they're planning to get married. They have enough for a basic wedding but want something more special. The car is old, unused, and inherited. The fianc\u00e9 thinks selling it would help, but the other person is resistant.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they feel they should have a say in shared assets. The car is in their garage, so maybe they both have access to it. However, the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. That might mean it's his personal property, especially if it was an inheritance. In some places, inherited assets are considered separate property unless they've been commingled or used jointly.\n\nThe author is pushing to sell it for the wedding, which is a shared expense. But if the car is his separate property, he might be within his rights to say no. The author's frustration is understandable because they're trying to plan a wedding, but they might be overstepping by wanting to sell something that's not jointly owned. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is important. If he's getting angry and not discussing it, that's a problem. However, the author might not realize that the car is his to decide about. The question is whether the author is wrong for suggesting selling it without considering it's his property.\n\nSo, if the car is his inheritance, the author can't force him to sell it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for assuming they can make that decision. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe they're in a common law state where joint assets matter. But unless the car is a joint asset, the author can't claim ownership. The author's argument about shared assets might not hold if the car is his separately. So the answer is A.\n"
