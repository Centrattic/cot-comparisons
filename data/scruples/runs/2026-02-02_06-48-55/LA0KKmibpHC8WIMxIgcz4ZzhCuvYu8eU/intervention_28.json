It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell her partner's old car to fund a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (the fianc\u00e9) found out the car is worth a lot and wants to sell it. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that they can't afford a good wedding, so selling the car would help. The other person (the fianc\u00e9) is against it, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the car was left to him by his dad. That's personal. Maybe he has sentimental value attached. The author suggests that shared assets should be discussed equally. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset and not open to discussion. \n\nBut wait, in a relationship, both partners should communicate and make decisions together. The author is trying to find a solution, which is reasonable. However, selling an inherited item might be a personal choice. The fianc\u00e9 might value the car for reasons beyond money. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they're trying to plan a wedding they can afford. But pushing to sell something that's meaningful could be wrong. The author didn't consider the emotional aspect. Maybe they should have discussed it more carefully instead of insisting on selling it. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening and being closed-minded. The author is trying to solve a real problem. It's a balance between financial planning and respecting personal property. \n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author had the right to push for selling the car without considering the other person's feelings. Since the car is his inheritance, maybe the author overstepped by not respecting his wishes. So, answer A (author is in the wrong) might be correct. But others might argue that shared financial planning is part of being engaged. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author didn't consider the sentimental value and forced the issue, which is wrong.\n"
