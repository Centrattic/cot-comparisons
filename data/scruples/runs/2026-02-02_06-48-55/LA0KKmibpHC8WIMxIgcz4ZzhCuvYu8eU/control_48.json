It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for the wedding. The car is worth $50k, but the fianc\u00e9 (the person in question) wants to sell it, while the other person is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They're engaged, so they're planning to get married. The author is frustrated because they can't afford a nice wedding and found out the car is valuable. The fianc\u00e9 is resistant, even getting angry. The author feels like they should have a say over joint assets.\n\nBut wait, is the car actually a shared asset? If the car was left to him by his dad, maybe he has sole ownership until they get married. Once they're married, maybe it becomes shared. But they're not married yet. So the author might not have a legal claim to it yet. That could be a point. The author is using the term \"our assets,\" but if the car is his inheritance, it's not necessarily their shared asset yet. That might be where the author is in the wrong\u2014assuming joint ownership when it's not established yet.\n\nAlso, the author is pushing to sell it for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 might have sentimental value attached to it. Even if it's not used, maybe it's important to him. The author didn't consider that and just thinks it's worth money. Communication is a big part here. The author is bringing it up repeatedly, and the fianc\u00e9 is getting irritated. Maybe the author is being too forceful without understanding the emotional aspect.\n\nAnother angle: financial planning. They're not making much, so saving for a wedding is difficult. The author wants to use the car's value, but the fianc\u00e9 might have other plans for that money or see the car as a future asset. Or maybe he doesn't want to sell it for personal reasons. The author is trying to solve their financial problem by selling it, but the fianc\u00e9's refusal might be based on other factors.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If they're pressuring to sell an asset that's not jointly owned yet and dismissing the fianc\u00e9's reasons, then maybe yes. They should have discussed it more and respected his feelings. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
