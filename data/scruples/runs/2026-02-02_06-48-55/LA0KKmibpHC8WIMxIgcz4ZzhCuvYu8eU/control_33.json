It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to sell the fianc\u00e9's old car to pay for the wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: They're engaged, saving for a basic wedding, but the author wants something more. The fianc\u00e9 has a car worth $50k that's not used. The author suggests selling it, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points. The car was left to him by his dad. He doesn't use it, but it's sentimental? Maybe he values it beyond monetary reasons. The author feels they should share assets and make joint decisions. The fianc\u00e9 is getting irritated, not discussing it rationally.\n\nLegally, since they're not married yet, the car is his personal property. So selling it would require his consent. The author can't force him. Even if they plan to merge assets in the future, right now he owns it. The author's approach might be dismissive of his feelings about the car, which could be a family heirloom. \n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated because they're trying to plan a better wedding. But the fianc\u00e9 might have emotional ties to the car. The author's argument that it's \"just sitting there\" might not consider his perspective. The author is pushing for a joint decision, but he's resisting. \n\nIs the author wrong? They have valid reasons for wanting to use the money, but they don't own the car. Pressuring someone to sell something they value without understanding their reasons could be wrong. The author should have tried to understand why he's against selling instead of just pushing for it. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't respecting his personal property and his father's legacy. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering the fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment and are pressuring him without mutual agreement. Even if the car isn't used, it's his to decide unless they agreed otherwise. The author should have discussed it more sensitively and respected his stance.\n"
