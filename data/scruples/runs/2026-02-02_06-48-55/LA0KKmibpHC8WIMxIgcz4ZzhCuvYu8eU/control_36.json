It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.

It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for their wedding. They don't have enough savings for a big wedding, and the car is worth a lot but the fianc\u00e9 refuses to sell it. The author is frustrated because the car is unused and taking up space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership of the car. The car was left to him by his dad, so maybe he feels a sentimental attachment. But they're engaged and planning a wedding. The author argues that their assets should be shared, which makes sense because they're getting married. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as his personal property, especially if it's inherited. \n\nThe author's main point is that they need the money for the wedding, which they want to be special. But selling a car that's sentimental could be a big deal for the fianc\u00e9. The question is whether the author is overstepping by pressuring him to sell something he's attached to. \n\nThey've tried discussing it but he shuts down the conversation. The author keeps bringing it up, leading to frustration. Maybe the issue is communication. Even if they share assets, respecting each other's feelings is important. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the car is a family heirloom, and the author is dismissing that. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect to sell an inherited item for a wedding? It depends on the circumstances. If the car wasn't being used and they need the money, maybe. But the fianc\u00e9's refusal could be due to emotional reasons, not just practicality. The author might not be considering his feelings enough. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're pressuring him without understanding his emotional attachment, maybe. But they also have a valid point about shared assets. The key is whether the author is respecting his feelings or just pushing their own wants. The answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could be approaching it the wrong way. Since the options are A (yes) or B (no), and the author's reasoning is about shared assets and practicality, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but they should communicate better. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering his feelings. Hmm. I need to decide based on the story provided.\n"
