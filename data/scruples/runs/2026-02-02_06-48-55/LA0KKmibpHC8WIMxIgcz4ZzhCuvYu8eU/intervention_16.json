It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her fianc\u00e9 to sell his inherited car to fund their wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: They're engaged, saving for a basic wedding, but the author wants a more special one. She found out the unused car in the garage is worth $50k. When she suggests selling it, he gets upset and won't discuss it. She feels they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points. The car was left to him by his dad. That's a personal inheritance. In many relationships, especially before marriage, financial decisions can be tricky. She might feel they're a team and should share resources, but he might see the car as his personal property, even if it's not used. \n\nInheritance is often considered separate property, not marital assets, unless they've already combined finances. Since they're not married yet, his inheritance might be his to do with as he likes. The author's push to sell it could be seen as overstepping if he's not on board. \n\nAlso, communication is key. He's getting irritated when she brings it up, which suggests he's not receptive. She's frustrated, but maybe she's not respecting his emotional attachment to the car, even if it's not practical. His dad's inheritance might hold sentimental value for him, which she's not considering.\n\nSo, the author's argument is about wanting to use shared assets for the wedding, but if the car is his inheritance and he's not willing to sell, she might be in the wrong by pressuring him. Financial decisions in a relationship require mutual agreement, especially when it involves someone's personal property. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong).\n"
