It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to fund their wedding. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 and fianc\u00e9e are engaged, and they can't afford a big wedding. The author found out the fianc\u00e9's unused car is worth $50k. They want to sell it, but he's against it. The author feels they should have shared assets and decisions.\n\nSo, the main points are: the car is old and unused, inherited, and the author wants to sell it despite his opposition. The fianc\u00e9 is getting irritated. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to make their wedding special, which is understandable. They might see the car as an opportunity. But the car was a gift to the fianc\u00e9, so maybe he has emotional attachment or other reasons not to sell. Also, is the author right in assuming shared assets? Since they're not yet married, maybe the car is still his. Even if they're engaged, legal ownership might be his. The author pushing to sell without mutual agreement could be overstepping.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's refusal might be because of sentimental value, not just money. The author is pressuring him, making him angry. Maybe they should have discussed it more calmly and found a compromise. The author might not realize that the car isn't just a financial asset but has personal significance. So, the author's approach might be wrong in not respecting his wishes and not considering his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to use available resources for their shared future. They might feel it's a practical solution. But the key is communication and mutual agreement. If he's not willing to sell, the author shouldn't push. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using some of the car's value without selling it entirely. But the author seems to be insisting, which could be the issue.\n\nSo, considering shared assets, the author's insistence without agreement, and the fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment, the author might be in the wrong. They should have discussed it more respectfully and found a compromise instead of pushing to sell it against his wishes. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
