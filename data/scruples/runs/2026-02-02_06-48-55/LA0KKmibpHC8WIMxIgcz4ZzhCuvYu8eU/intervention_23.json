It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell a car left to the groom by his father to help fund a more elaborate wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author believes they're justified because they want a special wedding and the car is unused. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset about selling it, which suggests emotional or sentimental value attached to the car. The author mentions that the car is old and unused, but maybe it's important to him for reasons beyond financial. \n\nThe author argues that as a fianc\u00e9, they share assets and should have equal say. However, the car was a gift to the groom, so maybe he feels it's his to decide. The author's approach might be seen as pressuring him to part with something personal. Even if the car is valuable, the groom's emotional attachment could make selling it a sensitive issue. \n\nAlso, the author kept pushing despite the groom getting irritated, which might indicate poor communication. The key here is whether respecting the groom's feelings about the car is more important than using it for the wedding. If the car has sentimental value, the author's insistence could be inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's desire for a memorable wedding is understandable. But financial decisions in a relationship require mutual agreement, especially when one person is resistant. The author might not have considered the groom's perspective, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, considering shared assets versus individual sentimental value, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
