It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting selling her fianc\u00e9's old car to fund a more elaborate wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, and she's frustrated because she feels their assets should be shared.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they can't afford a good wedding, and selling the car would help. She did some research and found it's worth a lot. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset and doesn't want to talk about it. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might value the car for sentimental reasons since it was left by his dad. Maybe it's not just about money for him.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9, so they're about to be married. The question is about shared assets. Legally, in some places, assets acquired before marriage might be considered separate. But since they're engaged and planning to marry, maybe they see things as joint. However, the fianc\u00e9's car might still be his personal property. She's suggesting using it without his consent, which could be an issue.\n\nAlso, communication is key here. The author says he shut her down and got irritated. Maybe she didn't present the idea in a respectful way. If she's pushing him to sell something he's attached to, especially without understanding his feelings, that's a problem. The car might hold sentimental value, and she didn't consider that.\n\nBut she also has valid reasons. They're struggling financially, and she wants a memorable wedding. However, the approach might be wrong. Instead of insisting on selling the car, maybe they should find a compromise. It's possible she's overstepping by not respecting his feelings about the car. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to be upset if he values the car emotionally.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because she's pressuring him to sell something he's attached to without fully understanding his perspective. While their financial situation is tough, respecting each other's assets and feelings is important. The answer might be A, but I need to make sure.\n"
