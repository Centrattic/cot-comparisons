It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to pay for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The car is old and unused, given to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's worth $50k, which would help with a more elaborate wedding. The fianc\u00e9 brings this up, but the other partner gets angry and refuses to discuss it. The author feels they should have equal say over shared assets.\n\nSo, who's right? Well, the car was inherited, which might be a personal asset. In many jurisdictions, inherited property can be considered separate, not marital. But if they are engaged, the legal status of assets might be different. Even if they're not married yet, the fianc\u00e9 might still consider it his personal property. \n\nThe author wants to sell it for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it. The author is frustrated because they can't have the wedding they want. But is it fair to pressure someone to sell something they inherited, especially if they have sentimental value? The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be because of emotional attachment, not just about the money.\n\nThe author argues that since they're getting married, their assets should be shared. However, until they are married, legal ownership might still be separate. Even if they are engaged, the car was his dad's, so it's his to dispose of. The author's assumption that they can use it for the wedding might not respect the fianc\u00e9's feelings or wishes.\n\nSo, the author is pushing for selling an asset that isn't jointly owned, and the fianc\u00e9 is resisting. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the fianc\u00e9's ownership and feelings. They should have discussed alternatives to the wedding budget without pressuring to sell the car. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the engagement status affects asset sharing? But generally, until married, assets are separate. So the author's approach was wrong. Answer A.\n"
