It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 who wants to sell an old car to pay for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The couple is engaged, and they can't save much for the wedding because they're not making enough money. The car is old, unused, and worth $50k. The fianc\u00e9 wants to sell it, but the other person is resistant. The author feels they should have an equal say over their assets.\n\nThe author argues that the car is taking up space and that selling it would help them have a better wedding. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset and not discussing it. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know more.\n\nHmm. Assets in a relationship being shared\u2014generally, when engaged, you're planning to merge finances, but legally, until marriage, assets are individual unless they've been designated otherwise. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, so maybe it's his property. The author's reasoning is that since they're about to get married, they should treat it as shared. But legally, maybe it's still his. So selling it without his consent could be an issue.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The author is trying to push the sale, but the fianc\u00e9 is getting mad. The author might not be considering the emotional value of the car. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has sentimental reasons for keeping it. The author is focused on the monetary gain for the wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 might not want to part with it. That could be a valid reason.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the car is the fianc\u00e9's personal property and selling it without consent is against his wishes, then the author is overstepping. They should discuss and find a compromise, but the author is persistently pushing without considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
