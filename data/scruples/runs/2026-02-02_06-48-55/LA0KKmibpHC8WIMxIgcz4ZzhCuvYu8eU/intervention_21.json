It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about selling an old car to fund their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 wants to sell it because it's worth a lot and they need money, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, the car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. That's a family heirloom or something sentimental. The author found out it's worth $50k and wants to sell it for the wedding. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset and not discussing it. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. They're engaged, so they're planning to share finances. The author might think that shared assets mean they can make decisions together. But maybe the car has sentimental value. The fianc\u00e9 might not want to sell it because of that. \n\nThe author is pushing to sell it, which the fianc\u00e9 resists. The author feels they have equal say, but the fianc\u00e9 disagrees. The key points are: ownership of the car, sentimental value vs. financial gain, and communication issues. \n\nThe car is his inheritance, so technically, it's his property. Even in a shared financial situation, personal items might be different. The author might not have the right to decide to sell it without his consent. \n\nAlso, the author is frustrated because they can't get a discussion. Maybe they should have approached it differently, but the main issue is whether selling the car was their decision to make. Since it's his dad's inheritance, the fianc\u00e9 has the right to keep it, even if it's not used. \n\nSo, the author is trying to use someone else's personal property without considering their feelings, which could be wrong. But they also have valid reasons about the wedding finances. However, respecting boundaries and consent is important. So the answer might be A.\n"
