It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for wanting to sell their fianc\u00e9's old car to pay for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and isn't discussing it, which is causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship status. They're engaged but not yet married. In some places, assets might still be separate until marriage. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his father, so it's his inheritance. Inheritance is typically considered separate property, not marital assets. So selling it without his consent might be an issue.\n\nThe author's intention is to use the money for the wedding. They mention they can't afford a big wedding and want to make it special. However, the car isn't being used, and it's worth a lot. The problem is whether the author has the right to push for selling it without mutual agreement. \n\nFinancial decisions, especially major ones like selling a valuable asset, usually require mutual consent in a committed relationship. Even if they're engaged, if the car is his inheritance, the fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with it. The author might feel entitled, but that could overstep, especially if it's his sentimental or personal property. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is getting irritated and refusing to discuss it, which is a problem. The author is frustrated because they feel their input should be considered. However, pushing without understanding why the fianc\u00e9 is against it could be where the author is wrong. Maybe there's sentimental value or other reasons the car isn't for sale. The author didn't get a reasonable discussion, but that doesn't justify ignoring the fianc\u00e9's stance.\n\nSo, considering the ownership of the car and the need for mutual agreement on major financial decisions, the author might be in the wrong by pressuring the sale without respecting his ownership and wishes. They should have discussed it more to understand his perspective and perhaps found another solution together.\n"
