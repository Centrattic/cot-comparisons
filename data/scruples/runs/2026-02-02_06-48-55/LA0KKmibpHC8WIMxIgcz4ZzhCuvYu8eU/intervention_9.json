It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The author's fianc\u00e9 has an old car worth $50k that's not used, and she wants to sell it to fund their wedding. He's against it, and she's upset because he's not discussing it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They're engaged, so they're planning a shared future, but they're not yet married. The car was inherited by him from his dad. The key points are ownership of the car and the authority to make decisions about it, especially since it's his asset. \n\nThe author argues that their assets should be shared, and they should make joint decisions. But until they're married, in many places, assets are still individual unless they're in a common law or other specific arrangement. So, if the car is in his name, it's his property. She's suggesting using it for a shared expense (the wedding), but he might have emotional or sentimental value attached to it, even if it's not used.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he's not open to discussion. But does that mean she's in the wrong? She's trying to solve a problem they both have (not enough funds for the wedding) by using an asset. However, she might be overstepping by not respecting his ownership and emotional attachment. \n\nAlso, the car's value is a surprise to her. He might have known it was valuable, or maybe he didn't. If he didn't know, selling it might be a big deal. But even if he did know, he has the right to decide what to do with his property. \n\nThe author's approach might be confrontational, not considering his feelings. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be because he feels she's not respecting his property or his wishes. So, the author might be in the wrong by pushing to sell something that's his and not being open to his perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the wedding is a joint commitment, and she's trying to plan a meaningful day. But the means (selling his car) might not be the right approach. So, maybe the answer is A, she's in the wrong for not considering his ownership and emotional ties, and for being pushy.\n"
