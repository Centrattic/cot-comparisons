It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car to fund a wedding, but the other partner is against it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is engaged and has been for over a year. They can't save much because they're not earning enough. The fianc\u00e9 found out the unused car is worth $50k, which they could use for a better wedding. But the fianc\u00e9's partner is refusing to discuss it and getting angry.\n\nThe author feels that since they're getting married, their assets should be shared and they should have an equal say. The partner is being dismissive and aggressive. \n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The car is an asset, and in a relationship, especially when engaged, shared decisions are expected. However, the car was inherited by the fianc\u00e9, so maybe there's an emotional attachment. The author might not consider why the partner is against selling it. Maybe the car has sentimental value, or the partner wants to keep it for a specific reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to use the car's value for a shared goal\u2014the wedding. They are not wrong in wanting to use assets they both have access to. But the way the author is pushing might not respect the partner's feelings. The partner's reaction is extreme, but the author's approach might be too confrontational without understanding the partner's perspective. \n\nHowever, in a committed relationship, discussing finances and shared goals is important. The author's frustration is understandable. They might not be wrong for wanting to use the asset, but they need to approach it with more empathy. The partner's refusal to communicate is problematic, but the author's insistence without considering the emotional aspect could be an issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The car is in the garage, unused. The author did check the value and found it's significant. They are not wrong in suggesting selling it. The partner's reaction is the main issue here. The author's intent is to make the wedding special, which is a valid desire. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because they are trying to use resources they believe are available for a shared goal. The partner's resistance without discussion is the main problem here. The author isn't wrong for suggesting selling the car to improve their wedding plans.\n"
