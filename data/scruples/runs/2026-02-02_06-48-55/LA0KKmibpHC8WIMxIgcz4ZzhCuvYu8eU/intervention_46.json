It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell her partner's old car to pay for a more elaborate wedding. The partner inherited the car and it's worth $50k, but he's against selling it. The author feels they should have equal say over shared assets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're engaged and planning a wedding, but their savings are limited. The car is unused and in the garage. The author found out it's valuable and wants to sell it. The partner is resistant and gets upset when discussed.\n\nNow, the key points here. The car was inherited by the partner, so legally, it might be his personal asset unless they have a shared property agreement. Even though they're engaged, marriage doesn't automatically make all assets shared unless they have a prenup or are in a community property state. So, the partner might see it as his personal inheritance, not a joint asset yet.\n\nThe author's argument is about equal say in shared assets. But engagement doesn't equate to marital rights. The partner might feel that selling his inherited property is a personal decision. The author is pushing for a wedding budget, which is a shared goal, but the car is his to dispose of as he wishes.\n\nAlso, the partner's reaction is anger, which is a problem. Healthy communication is important in relationships. The author is frustrated because her input is being dismissed. However, the partner's ownership of the car is a key factor. The author might be overstepping by pressuring him to sell something he inherited without his consent.\n\nAnother angle: the car's value is significant. If they need more funds for the wedding, maybe they should explore other options together instead of focusing on his personal asset. The author's approach could seem disrespectful to the partner's inheritance. The partner's resistance might stem from emotional attachment or the idea that the car was a gift from his father.\n\nSo, while the author's desire for a memorable wedding is understandable, pressuring the partner to sell his inherited property without his agreement could be seen as inconsiderate. The partner's right to his inheritance and the lack of joint ownership in the car are important points. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his decision and pushing the issue.\n"
