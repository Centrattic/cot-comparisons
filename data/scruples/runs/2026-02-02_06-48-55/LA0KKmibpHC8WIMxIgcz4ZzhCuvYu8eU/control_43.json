It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9e suggesting selling her fianc\u00e9's inherited car to fund their wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is engaged for over a year but can't save much for the wedding. The car is old and unused, worth a lot, but the fianc\u00e9 is against selling it. The author feels they should share assets and have equal say, but the fianc\u00e9 gets irritated.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad, so he might have sentimental value. Even if it's not used, he might not want to sell it for personal reasons. The author's reasoning is practical\u2014using the car's value for the wedding. But the fianc\u00e9's reaction is a key factor here. \n\nIs it the author's place to push this? Since they're engaged, they should be discussing big expenses together. However, the car is his inheritance. The author's approach might be seen as overstepping if she's pressuring him to sell something he values emotionally. Even if it's logical, the fianc\u00e9's emotional attachment should be considered. \n\nAlso, the way the author describes the situation: she's persistent, and he gets more irritated each time. This suggests a communication issue. The author might be right in wanting to use shared resources for the wedding but wrong in how she's approaching it, not respecting his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if they're planning to share assets, maybe selling the car is a mutual decision. The fianc\u00e9's refusal without discussion could be problematic. But the car was his inheritance, so maybe he has the right to decide. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to improve the wedding experience, but the fianc\u00e9 might have valid reasons. The key here is mutual respect. The author might not be wrong in suggesting it, but if she's pressuring him and he's uncomfortable, that's where the problem lies. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering inheritance and personal property, even in a relationship, the car was his and he might have sentimental reasons. The author's insistence could be seen as not respecting his wishes. So, maybe the answer is A, she's in the wrong. But I need to check again. \n\nAlternatively, if they're planning to merge assets, maybe the car becomes a shared asset. But since it's an inheritance, it typically remains his property unless they agreed otherwise. So she doesn't have equal say unless he agrees. Therefore, she's overstepping by demanding he sell it. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
