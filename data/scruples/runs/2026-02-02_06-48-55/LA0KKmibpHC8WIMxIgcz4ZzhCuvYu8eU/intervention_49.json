It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting their fianc\u00e9 to sell a $50k car to fund a better wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's car is inherited and unused. The author wants to use it for their wedding, but he's against it. The author argues that they should share assets and that the car isn't being used.\n\nHmm. In a relationship, especially when engaged, finances can be tricky. The car was his dad's, so maybe there's sentimental value. The fianc\u00e9 might not want to sell it for personal reasons. The author is pushing to sell it, which the fianc\u00e9 is clearly upset about. \n\nIs it fair for the author to make such a demand? They both are saving for a wedding, but the author is prioritizing a more elaborate wedding over his feelings about the car. Maybe the author didn't consider that the car has emotional significance. Also, using inherited property might not be something he's willing to do, even if it's not used. \n\nThe author might think they're being practical, but relationships require compromise. If the fianc\u00e9 is getting angry and refuses to discuss it, the author might be overstepping by pushing this request without understanding his perspective. \n\nSo, the author's intentions are good, but the approach could be wrong. They didn't consider his feelings or the car's importance to him. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're dismissing his feelings and the car's sentimental value.\n"
