It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting selling their fianc\u00e9's old car to fund a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple is engaged for over a year, struggling to save for a wedding they want to be special. They have enough for a basic one. The fianc\u00e9 has a car left by his dad that's worth $50k but unused. The author suggests selling it, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant and gets angry. The author feels they should share assets and have equal say, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're trying to solve a problem. The car isn't being used and could generate funds for the wedding. They did some research to find out its value. They might feel that since they're about to be married, joint decisions are necessary. The author's intention is to make the wedding meaningful and share in financial decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have sentimental value attached to the car. It was from his father, so selling it could be emotional. Even if it's not used, it's a keepsake. He might not want to part with it, even for the wedding. The author pushing the issue could be causing tension, especially if he's not ready to discuss it. He might feel pressured or that his personal asset is being taken without consent.\n\nLegally, if the car is his personal property (inherited), it might not be shared until marriage. Unless they're in a common law state or have a prenup, the car could be his. The author might not have the legal standing to demand its sale. Emotionally, the fianc\u00e9's resistance could be valid if the car holds sentimental value. The author's frustration is understandable, but respecting his feelings is important. \n\nThe key points here are: ownership of the asset, emotional attachment, communication issues, and the stage of their relationship (engaged but not married yet). The author might not fully consider the sentimental aspect and the legal ownership. The fianc\u00e9's anger could stem from feeling his personal item is being disregarded. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's request seems reasonable for the wedding, but the method might not be. Forcing the sale without considering his feelings could be seen as overstepping. However, the author's desire for a better wedding is valid too. It's a balance between practicality and respect for personal items.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be if they didn't consider the sentimental value and the car's ownership status. If the car is his, selling it without mutual agreement (even in a relationship) could be problematic. The author's approach might not be respectful of his feelings, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing.\n"
