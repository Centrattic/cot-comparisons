It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their fianc\u00e9 to sell an old car to pay for the wedding. The fianc\u00e9 inherited the car from his dad and it's not used. The author found out it's worth $50k and wants to sell it for a better wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and not open to discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They're engaged, so they're planning to marry, but they're still separate individuals until then. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 specifically, so maybe he has sentimental value attached. The author wants to use it for the wedding, which is a shared goal, but the fianc\u00e9 might feel it's his personal property.\n\nThe author argues that they should share assets and have equal say. But technically, until they get married, the car is his. Even after marriage, how they handle assets can vary based on their agreement. The author might assume joint ownership, but if the car is in his name, selling it might require his consent.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is a key point. He becomes irritated and shuts down discussions. That's not ideal communication. The author is trying to find a solution for the wedding, which is important to them. But maybe the author didn't consider the emotional value the fianc\u00e9 has for the car. It's possible he's not just being stubborn but has feelings tied to the car from his father.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. They're trying to make the wedding special, and the car is an unused asset. However, respecting each other's property and feelings is crucial. The author might have approached it without understanding the sentimental aspect. Maybe a compromise could be better, like selling other assets or adjusting the wedding budget.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention is valid\u2014they want a memorable wedding. But the approach might not consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective. The fianc\u00e9's refusal could be due to personal reasons, not just financial. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his wishes and pushing too hard, not considering the emotional value. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if they believe shared assets should be used for shared goals.\n\nBut since the car was a gift to him, and he's not using it, it's his to decide. The author's insistence without his agreement might overstep. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
