It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is engaged and wants to sell an old car their fianc\u00e9 inherited to fund a more elaborate wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, but the author thinks they should share assets and have equal say.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is old, unused, and worth $50k. They can't afford a nice wedding yet, and the author wants to sell the car. But the fianc\u00e9 is resistant. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're trying to use shared assets for a common goal (their wedding). They mention that their assets should be shared, which makes sense in a marriage. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see the car as a sentimental item or have other plans for it. Maybe he doesn't want to sell it for personal reasons, like sentimental value, or he might think it's not in good enough condition to sell for that price. \n\nThe author did some research and found the car's value, which seems reasonable. But the fianc\u00e9 is not open to discussion, which is a problem. The author is pushing for it because they want their wedding to be special, which is understandable. However, the fianc\u00e9's resistance could indicate that there's more to the situation, like the car being a family heirloom or a source of income if he ever fixes it up. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The author is trying to use the car as a shared asset, but the fianc\u00e9 might not see it that way. The author might be assuming that the car is a shared asset, but if the fianc\u00e9 inherited it, it could be considered his personal property until they have a prenuptial agreement. \n\nAlso, the author is pressuring the fianc\u00e9, which could be causing tension. While the author's intention is to improve their wedding, forcing the sale without the fianc\u00e9's consent could be seen as overstepping. The right approach might be to discuss and find a compromise, like selling the car but using some of the money for the wedding and some for other expenses, or finding other ways to fund the wedding without selling the car. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not respecting the fianc\u00e9's wishes and not considering that the car might have sentimental or other value. Even if the car is unused, the fianc\u00e9 has the right to make decisions about his inherited property unless they've agreed otherwise. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for pushing to sell it without the fianc\u00e9's approval.\n"
