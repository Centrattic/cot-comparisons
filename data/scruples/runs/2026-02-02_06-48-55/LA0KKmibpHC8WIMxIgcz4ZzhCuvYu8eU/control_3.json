It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is engaged and they're trying to save up for a wedding, but they don't have much. They found out that the fianc\u00e9's old, unused car is worth $50k. The author wants to sell it to pay for a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets angry. The author feels they should share assets and have equal say, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the car's ownership. The car was left to the fianc\u00e9 by his dad. So it's his personal property, right? Unless they are in a common-law marriage or have some shared ownership agreement, it's his car. The author is suggesting selling it without his consent, which might be an issue.\n\nBut they're engaged, so maybe they're pooling resources. However, legally, until they are married, assets are still individual. The fianc\u00e9 might not want to sell the car for personal reasons, like sentimental value. The author didn't consider that and just wants to sell it for the wedding. That could be seen as not respecting his feelings or ownership.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to make the wedding special, which is understandable. They might feel that the car is an unused asset that could help them both. But the key point is that the fianc\u00e9 is not willing to discuss it and gets angry. The author is pushing the issue, which could be causing conflict. Maybe they should have approached it more sensitively or considered why he doesn't want to sell the car.\n\nSo the author's actions are based on wanting a better wedding, but they might be overstepping by not respecting the fianc\u00e9's ownership and emotional attachment to the car. The author is assuming the car is a shared asset, which it might not be. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not respecting his wishes and not considering his perspective before pressing the issue.\n"
