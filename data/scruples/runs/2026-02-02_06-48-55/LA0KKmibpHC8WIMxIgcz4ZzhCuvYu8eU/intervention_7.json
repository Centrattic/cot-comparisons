It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting selling an old, unused car that was left to her fianc\u00e9's dad to help pay for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is against it and gets angry, so the author feels frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is old and unused, worth $50k, which would help with their wedding. The author wants to sell it, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant. The author argues that as future spouses, they should share assets and decisions, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't listening.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong here? Well, the car was an inheritance to the fianc\u00e9's dad. Inheriting property can be personal, especially if it's sentimental. The fianc\u00e9 might have emotional ties to it, even if it's not used. The author might not be considering that. Also, the engagement isn't about ownership; each person might have separate properties unless they agreed otherwise. The author is pushing to sell something that's his to decide about, perhaps without respecting his feelings.\n\nThe author's intention is to have a memorable wedding, which is understandable, but the approach might be dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is frustration, which could stem from feeling that his personal property is being disregarded. The author's argument about shared assets might not apply here if the car isn't jointly owned yet. They are engaged but not married, so legal ownership might still be separate unless they agreed otherwise.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because she's not considering the emotional value and the fianc\u00e9's rights over his inherited property. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide what to do with his own property, even if it's not being used. The author is trying to use it for their mutual benefit, but without mutual consent, it's a conflict. Therefore, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
