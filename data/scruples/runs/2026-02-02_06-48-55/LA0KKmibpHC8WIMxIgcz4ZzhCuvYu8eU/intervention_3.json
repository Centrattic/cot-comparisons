It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to sell an old car left by the groom's father to pay for a wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is resistant and gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're engaged, so they're planning a future together. The author is trying to use an asset (the car) that's in the garage. The car is inherited by the fianc\u00e9, so maybe there's an emotional attachment there. The author found out it's worth $50k online, which is a lot, and wants to use it for the wedding. But the fianc\u00e9 is refusing to discuss it seriously and getting irritated.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The car is the fianc\u00e9's inherited property. In many places, inherited assets might be considered separate, especially if they're not married yet. So the author might not have the legal right to decide to sell it. But in a relationship, especially one where they're planning to get married, shared financial decisions are common. However, if the car was left to him specifically, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has the right to decide not to sell it.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they need the money for the wedding and the car isn't being used. But the fianc\u00e9 might have sentimental value attached to it, even if it's not used. The author could be pressuring him against his will, which might be a problem. The author also mentions that the fianc\u00e9 shuts down the discussion, which could indicate communication issues.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if the car is his to do with as he pleases, then the author is overstepping by pressuring him to sell it without mutual agreement. Even in a relationship, respecting each other's assets is important. The author might not have considered the emotional significance or the potential that the fianc\u00e9 might want to keep it for other reasons (maybe family history, etc.). The author's approach might be seen as not respecting the fianc\u00e9's wishes, even if the financial logic is sound.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to plan a wedding they can afford and wants it to be special. They might feel they're doing what's best for both of them. But the key issue here is that the fianc\u00e9 is not open to the idea and is getting angry. The author might not realize that this is an asset the fianc\u00e9 values, even if it's not used. So maybe the wrong isn't in the idea of selling it, but in the approach and not respecting the fianc\u00e9's stance.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the fianc\u00e9's decision and pushing for something he's against. Even if the car isn't being used, it's his inherited property, and the author is trying to use it without his consent. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
