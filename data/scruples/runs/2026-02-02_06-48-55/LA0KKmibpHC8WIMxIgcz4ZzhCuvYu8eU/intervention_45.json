It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to sell the old car to pay for the wedding. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's dad left him a car that's worth $50k, but they don't use it. The author wants to sell it to have a better wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They're engaged, so they're planning to get married. The fianc\u00e9 inherited the car, which is his personal property. The author is suggesting using it for the wedding, which is a shared expense. But the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to sell it. \n\nThe author argues that their assets should be shared, which makes sense since they're getting married. However, the car is part of the fianc\u00e9's inheritance. Inheritance is usually considered separate property unless they have a prenup that specifies otherwise. So selling it might require both parties' consent, but legally, the fianc\u00e9 might have the right to refuse. \n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated because they want a memorable wedding and see the car as a solution. The fianc\u00e9 is getting upset, which could indicate that the car has sentimental value to him, even if it's not used. Maybe it's a family heirloom or has memories attached. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as not respecting the fianc\u00e9's feelings about the car. Even if the car isn't used, it's his to decide what to do with it. The author might not have considered why he's against selling it, other than the practical value. \n\nCommunication is a key issue here. The author is pushing hard, and the fianc\u00e9 is shutting down. This could lead to more conflict. They need to find a compromise, maybe discussing other ways to fund the wedding or understanding each other's perspectives.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the right in wanting to use shared resources for their wedding, but the car's status as an inherited asset complicates things. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to say no if it's his separate property. The author's insistence without considering emotions or legal aspects could be where they're in the wrong. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the fianc\u00e9's inheritance and are causing conflict without understanding his perspective.\n"
