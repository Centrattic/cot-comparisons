It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to sell her fianc\u00e9's old car to fund a wedding, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wants the wedding to be special and sees the car as a solution. The fianc\u00e9, however, might have sentimental value attached to the car from his father, even if it's not used. The key here is communication and respect for each other's feelings. \n\nThe author mentions that the car is in their garage, implying it's a shared asset. However, the fianc\u00e9 inherited it, so he might feel it's his personal property. Even if it's now in their shared space, the emotional value could make selling it a sensitive issue. The author is pushing for a sale without considering his feelings, which might be where they're wrong. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is shutting down and getting irritated. That's not helpful, but the author's approach might be contributing to that. They might not have given him a chance to explain why the car is important. The author's frustration is valid, but so is the fianc\u00e9's right to his feelings about the car. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is dismissing his feelings and insisting without understanding, that's a problem. They should have approached the conversation with empathy. The fianc\u00e9's refusal could be due to reasons beyond just the car's worth, like sentimental value. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the way they're handling it could be. They need to consider his perspective first before pushing for a sale. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting his emotional attachment and are acting unilaterally without proper discussion.\n"
