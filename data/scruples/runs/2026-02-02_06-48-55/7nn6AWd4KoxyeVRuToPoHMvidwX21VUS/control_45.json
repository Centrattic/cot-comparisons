He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for refusing to support their little brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother, Sean, is 14 and came out to the author, who is 24. The parents have expressed homophobic views, calling it a sickness and opposing marriage equality. Sean is nervous and wants the author's support. However, the author has a strained relationship with the parents due to past issues with addiction and bad behavior. The parents don't trust him, and the author fears his presence might make the situation worse by shifting focus to his past problems instead of supporting Sean.\n\nThe author tried to explain this to Sean but he got upset and feels abandoned. The author suggested other options, like a friend or an aunt, but Sean trusted the author most. Now they're not talking.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the factors. The author's refusal is based on a genuine fear that their presence could complicate the situation. They have a history that might make the parents react negatively, potentially making it harder for Sean. On the other hand, Sean feels he needs his brother's support and is hurt by the refusal.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's intention is to protect Sean by not being there, thinking it's for the best. However, emotionally, Sean feels unsupported. The author is offering alternative solutions, which shows they still care and want to help in other ways. The parents' homophobia is a significant hurdle, and the author's presence might not be the best support given their own history with the parents.\n\nI think the key here is the author's motivation and the potential consequences. They are trying to protect their brother from a possible worse situation. While it's hurtful to Sean, the author's decision is made with the intention to help, even if it's not in the way Sean wanted. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
