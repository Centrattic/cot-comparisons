He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The author has a complicated history with their parents due to past addiction and bad behavior, which led to a loss of trust. They feel that their presence might make the situation worse when the brother comes out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother is relying on the author as the only support system, given the parents' views. The author is worried that their presence could shift the focus from the brother's coming out to their own issues, potentially complicating things. But is that a valid reason to refuse?\n\nThe author's intention is to protect their brother by avoiding a potential escalation of the parents' negative reactions. However, the brother might feel abandoned, especially since he chose the author because he trusts them. The author's refusal might leave the brother feeling unsupported at a crucial time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be right in thinking that their presence could make the parents more hostile, either towards the brother or themselves. If the parents already distrust the author, having them there might not help the brother's case. However, the brother might need someone he trusts by his side, even if the outcome isn't perfect.\n\nThe key points are the author's reasoning and the brother's emotional needs. The author is making a judgment call based on their understanding of the parents' behavior, while the brother is looking for support. The question is whether the author's decision is wrong. It's a tough balance between being supportive and being realistic about the parents' potential reactions.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, being there for a sibling in such a vulnerable moment could be seen as important. However, the author's past issues might genuinely make the situation worse. It's a matter of weighing intentions versus outcomes. The author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing the brother's best interests as they see it, even if the brother feels hurt. Alternatively, the author could be wrong for not trying to find a middle ground, like being present but not engaging, to simply show support.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because their decision is based on a genuine concern for the brother's well-being in the context of their parents' potential hostility and their own lack of trust. However, there's room for the author to offer alternative support if possible, which they did suggest, but since the brother refused, it's a difficult situation.\n"
