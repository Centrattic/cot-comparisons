He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the older brother) is in the wrong for refusing to support his younger brother when the brother comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, the brother (Sean) has a significant history of addiction and bad behavior that led to a loss of trust with their parents. The author is concerned that his presence during the coming out might shift the focus to his past issues, potentially complicating things for Sean. The older brother has already made peace with his past and is clean, but the parents still don't trust him. \n\nSean is 14 and hasn't been told about the extent of the author's past actions. The author thinks that being there could make the parents more upset, not because of Sean's sexuality, but because of the author's history. Sean wants support from the one person who knows his situation, but the author feels his presence might be counterproductive.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's decision is based on protecting Sean's interests, thinking that his own history might derail the situation. But Sean feels abandoned and hurt, which is a valid emotional response. The key points are the author's intention versus Sean's feelings. The author wasn't being selfish for his own benefit but to avoid making things worse for Sean. However, Sean needed emotional support, and the author's refusal might have caused him distress.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's trying to act in Sean's best interest by avoiding a potentially worse scenario. On the other hand, he's not being there emotionally when Sean needs a supportive sibling. But the author did offer alternative solutions, like suggesting other people who could support Sean. Sean rejected those, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author wasn't obligated to be there, but his refusal caused emotional harm. However, his reasons are rooted in a genuine concern for Sean's well-being. The parents' homophobia is already a problem, and the author's presence might not help. So, it's a tough call. The author might be in the right if the potential for his presence to cause more harm is real. But if Sean's need for support is crucial, then the author could be seen as lacking in support. However, the author did try to provide other options, which he couldn't control Sean accepting. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because his decision was based on protecting Sean from a potentially worse situation and he offered alternatives, even if Sean didn't take them.\n"
