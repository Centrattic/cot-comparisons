He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for refusing to support their younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 24, and their brother Sean is 14. Sean came out to the author four months ago and now wants the author to be there when he tells their parents. The parents have expressed homophobic views. The author has a troubled past with addiction and stealing, which caused a lot of damage with the parents. They lost trust, especially since Sean was young during those events. The author feels that their presence might make the situation worse because the parents don't trust them.\n\nThe author suggests Sean go to someone else, like a friend or an aunt, but Sean is upset and feels the author isn't supporting him. The author is emotionally conflicted but stands by their decision. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author wrong for not being there? Well, the author's main reason is their strained relationship with the parents. If the author is there, the parents might focus more on their past issues rather than Sean's coming out. That could indeed complicate things. However, Sean really needs support, especially since the parents are hostile. The author is the only one who knows Sean is gay, so they feel isolated. \n\nBut the author is trying to protect Sean by avoiding a potential conflict. They might believe that their presence could derail the situation. On the other hand, Sean might feel abandoned, especially if he trusts the author the most. The author's refusal might be seen as not standing by their brother when he needs support the most. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is valid. Their past could make the parents more hostile, and the focus might shift to their issues instead of Sean's. The author is trying to be responsible, considering the dynamics. They are offering alternatives, like someone else accompanying Sean. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could be present in a way that doesn't trigger the parents, but the author thinks it's too risky. Given the parents' views and the author's history, maybe the author is making a difficult decision to avoid making things worse for Sean. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They are trying to protect Sean by not being there, but Sean needs support. However, the author's reasoning is based on protecting Sean from a potentially worse outcome. The author is not being selfish for their own benefit; it's about minimizing harm. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their decision is made with good intentions and a realistic assessment of the situation.\n"
