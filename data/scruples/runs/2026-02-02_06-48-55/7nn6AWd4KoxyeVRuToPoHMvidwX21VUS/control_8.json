He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they did the right thing by declining to support their brother when he comes out to their parents. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother is 14 and nervous about coming out to parents who have shown homophobia. He wants his older brother, who's 24, to come with him. The older brother has a history of addiction and bad behavior, which led to a strained relationship with the parents. The parents don't trust him and they don't want to risk making the situation worse by being there. \n\nThe author is concerned that his presence might turn the focus away from his brother and onto his own past issues. He offered alternatives, like going to a friend or an aunt, but the brother is set on him. The brother is upset and hasn't responded to texts. The author feels he's not being there, but thinks it's for the best.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the parents' homophobia is a big deal. If the parents are already distrustful of the older brother, having him there might make the parents dismiss the brother's coming out or even blame the older brother instead. The older brother's presence could derail the support Sean needs. \n\nOn the other hand, Sean feels hurt and abandoned. The older brother is the only one who knows, so Sean might feel he's being left alone. The older brother is trying to protect his brother by not causing more conflict, but maybe he should have found another way to support him without being physically present. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the older brother can support Sean in other ways, like helping him prepare for the conversation, writing a letter, or being available after the fact. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing to be present. \n\nThe author's reasoning is valid because he's trying to prevent the situation from getting worse for Sean. However, the way he handled it might have been too abrupt. He offered alternatives, but Sean didn't accept them. The key is whether refusing to be there is wrong. Since the parents' distrust could indeed complicate things, the author is acting in Sean's best interest, even if it's hard on their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author's decision is based on protecting his brother from potential negative consequences, even though the brother is feeling abandoned. The author's reasoning is sound despite the emotional fallout.\n"
