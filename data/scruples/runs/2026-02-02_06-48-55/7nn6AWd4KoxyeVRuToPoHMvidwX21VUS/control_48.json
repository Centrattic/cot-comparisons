He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the older brother refusing to support his younger brother when the younger one comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his parents have negative views towards the LGBTQ+ community. The younger brother, Sean, is nervous and wants support. The author has a troubled past with addiction and a strained relationship with their parents. He's worried that his presence during the coming out would complicate things, possibly shifting focus to his own issues instead of Sean's.\n\nThe author explains that he's concerned about making the situation worse because the parents don't trust him. He suggested alternatives like Sean talking to a friend or an aunt first. Sean feels hurt and thinks the author isn't supporting him. The key points here are the author's reasons versus Sean's need for emotional support.\n\nOn one hand, the author's decision is based on practicality\u2014his history might derail the main issue. On the other hand, Sean feels abandoned at a vulnerable moment. The author isn't being selfish, but he's prioritizing his brother's potential well-being over his desire to help. However, there's also the aspect of emotional support. Even if the author can't be present, maybe there are other ways to support Sean, like talking through it beforehand or after.\n\nThe question is whether refusing to be physically present makes the author at fault. Since the author isn't ignoring Sean's needs but is making a difficult choice based on his circumstances, it's not a clear-cut case of being in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards 'not in the wrong' (B), but there's room for understanding both sides. The author is making a tough decision based on his history, even if Sean doesn't see it that way.\n"
