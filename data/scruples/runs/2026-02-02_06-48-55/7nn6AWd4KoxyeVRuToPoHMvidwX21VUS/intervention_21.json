He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for refusing to support his younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, the author has a complicated history with their parents. They had issues with addiction and behavior that led to a loss of trust, and now the parents don't fully trust them. The brother wants the author's support, but the author is worried that their presence might make the situation worse because the parents already distrust them. The author suggested alternative supports, like friends or aunts, but the brother didn't agree and got upset.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not going. The author's reasoning is that their presence could shift focus to their own past issues, making the parents' reaction to the brother's coming out more complicated. The brother feels abandoned, which is understandable. But the author's intention is to protect the brother's well-being by not causing additional conflict.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The brother is vulnerable, relying on the only family member who knows his secret. The author is trying to be cautious, possibly to avoid their own past damaging the brother's moment. However, maybe the author should have found another way to support the brother, even if not being physically there. Like, being available afterwards for emotional support, or helping prepare him for the conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's history might indeed make the parents react more to them than to the brother's coming out. The author's refusal could be seen as self-serving, protecting their own reputation with parents, rather than being fully supportive. But they also have valid concerns about not wanting to derail the brother's important moment.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author's intentions seem good, but the execution might leave the brother feeling unsupported. The key is whether there were other ways to be supportive despite not being present. If the author could offer emotional support post-coming out, that might help. But from the brother's perspective, he wanted the most trusted person there. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author could have offered other forms of support. Since the author did offer alternatives (like other family members or friends), maybe they are not entirely in the wrong. However, the brother feeling alone might mean the author missed an opportunity to be there in a different way. But given the author's valid reasons, perhaps they are not in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
