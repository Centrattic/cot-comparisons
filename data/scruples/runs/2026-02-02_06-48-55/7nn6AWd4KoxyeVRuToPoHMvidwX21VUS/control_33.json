He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for refusing to support their younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The writer is 24, their brother Sean is 14. Sean came out to him 4 months ago, and he's the only one Sean has told so far. The parents have expressed negative views about the LGBT community, like opposing marriage rights and calling it a sickness.\n\nThe key points here are why the author refused to accompany Sean. The author has a history of addiction, bad behavior, and stealing, leading to a strained relationship with their parents. They mention that their parents don't trust them and even thought they were dead for a while. The author is now clean and trying to rebuild, but the parents still don't trust them. They believe that being present during Sean's coming out might shift the focus from Sean to their own past issues, potentially making the situation worse.\n\nSean is upset because he chose the author as support because he trusts them the most. The author tried to explain their reasoning but Sean is hurt and unresponsive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics. The author is concerned about their past affecting the situation. Their parents already have trust issues, so adding the author's presence might complicate things. If the parents are homophobic, the author's presence might lead them to focus on their past rather than Sean's coming out. The author's intention is to protect Sean by not drawing attention away from him.\n\nHowever, Sean feels abandoned, especially since he trusts the author the most. The author is trying to be supportive but in a different way. The author suggests alternative supports, like friends or aunts, but Sean resists. The author's refusal is based on practical reasons, not a lack of support. They still want to help but in a way that doesn't jeopardize Sean's situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's decision seems to be made with Sean's best interest in mind, considering their parents' potential reactions. However, the emotional impact on Sean is significant. The author might need to find another way to support Sean indirectly, like writing a letter or being available afterwards, but their refusal isn't necessarily wrong given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is based on protecting Sean from potential negative outcomes given their parents' history and their own past issues.\n"
