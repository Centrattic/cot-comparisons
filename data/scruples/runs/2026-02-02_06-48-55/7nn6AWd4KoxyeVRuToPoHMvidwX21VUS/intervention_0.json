He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their little brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The author, who is 24, has a complicated relationship with their parents due to past addiction and behavior issues. They lost their parents' trust and are worried that being present during the coming out might make things worse for Sean, who is 14.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's reasoning is that their presence might shift the focus from Sean's sexuality to the author's past, which could complicate the situation. The parents have already expressed homophobic views, so adding the author's history might make the parents more upset or distracted. On the other hand, Sean feels hurt and upset because he wanted his brother there, whom he trusts the most. The author offered alternatives like involving a friend or an aunt, but Sean didn't want to go with anyone else.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The author wants to support Sean but is concerned about their own history causing more harm. However, by not being there, Sean might feel abandoned, especially if he's already nervous. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their own potential issues over their brother's emotional needs. But maybe the author is trying to protect Sean from a potentially more volatile situation. \n\nThe parents are described as having hostile views towards LGBTQ+ individuals, so the outcome could be negative either way. If the author is there, the parents might focus on the author's past and become angry, which could overshadow or even derail Sean's coming out. But Sean might need the support of the one person he feels closest to, even if that person has a troubled history. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the intent and the outcome. The author's intention is to protect Sean from a possible worse scenario. However, Sean's need for support is significant, and the author is his closest trusted person. Refusing might make Sean feel less supported, which is important for his well-being. The author could have tried to mediate the situation differently, like preparing the parents beforehand, but they didn't. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns about their own relationship with the parents. If the parents are already distrustful, the author's presence might not help and could even make things worse. The key point is whether the author's refusal is in Sean's best interest. If the author's presence is likely to cause more harm, then they might not be in the wrong. But if Sean's emotional support is crucial and the author is the only one he trusts, then not being there could be seen as a failure to support him. \n\nThe author offered alternatives, which shows they want to help, but Sean rejected them. The author's decision might be a responsible one, considering the parents' possible reaction. However, the emotional impact on Sean is real. The question is whether the author's refusal is more about their own insecurities or genuinely protecting Sean. If the author is genuinely trying to shield Sean from a more hostile environment, they might not be at fault. But if they're avoiding responsibility, then they could be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the author's genuine concern for Sean's well-being and the potential consequences. Since the parents are already homophobic, the author's presence might introduce additional conflict. The author might not be in the wrong if their refusal is based on a realistic assessment of the situation. However, there's a risk of abandoning Sean when he needs support the most. \n\nBut the author did offer alternatives. Maybe they should have insisted on those or found another way to support Sean without being physically present. The fact that Sean is 14 and might not have many trusting adults makes the author's role significant. If the author can't be there, but still supports Sean emotionally and helps find another support person, that might be better. \n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Their refusal is based on a desire to prevent a worse outcome, and they're trying to help by suggesting other options. Sean's upset reaction is valid, but the author's reasoning is about protecting him from potential added harm. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
