He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the older brother is in the wrong for refusing to support his younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, the older brother has a history of addiction and bad behavior that led to his parents losing trust in him. The parents don't trust him now, even though he's clean. The younger brother wants his support because he's nervous about coming out, but the older brother thinks his presence might make things worse by shifting focus to his own issues. They had a conflict, and now the younger brother is upset and not responding.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The younger brother is in a vulnerable situation, coming out to parents with prejudiced views. He chose his older brother because he trusts him, which shows he values that relationship. Not being there might make him feel unsupported, which is tough. But the older brother is trying to protect the situation from getting worse by avoiding his own complicated history with the parents. His reasoning is that his presence could lead to more problems, not just for Sean but also for himself. \n\nIs the older brother in the wrong? Well, he didn't refuse out of selfishness. He's considering the potential negative impact. However, the younger brother needs support, and the older brother is the only one who knows his situation. The brother's refusal might leave Sean feeling isolated. But the older brother also can't be there if it could make things worse. \n\nMaybe there's a middle ground. The older brother offered alternatives, like telling someone else first. But Sean rejected those. The question is whether the refusal is in the wrong. Since the older brother's decision is based on protecting the outcome and not neglecting Sean's needs, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, support is important, and his absence might be hurtful. But given the complexities, the answer might be B. The brother isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the situation where his presence could cause more harm.\n"
