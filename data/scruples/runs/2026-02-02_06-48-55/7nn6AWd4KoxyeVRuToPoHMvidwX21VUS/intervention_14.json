He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for refusing to support his little brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, who's 24, has a 14-year-old brother, Sean, who just came out to him. The parents are described as having homophobic views, and Sean wants him to be there for support. The author, however, has a troubled past with addiction, a history of stealing, and a broken relationship with the parents. He's been clean for two years but still isn't trusted. He's worried that his presence might make the situation worse because the parents don't trust him. So he declines to be there when Sean comes out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a position where he's the only one Sean has come out to. Sean is 14, which is a vulnerable age, and he's seeking support. The author's refusal might leave Sean feeling isolated, especially since the parents are hostile. The author's explanation is valid\u2014he has a history that could make the parents' reaction more negative towards him, which might not help Sean. But emotionally, Sean might feel abandoned, especially if he chose his brother because he trusts him most.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to protect the situation. He's honest about his reasons. He's not ignoring Sean's need for support; he's suggesting alternatives like involving others. However, Sean is resistant to those alternatives. The author might be right to avoid a scenario where he could be blamed or where the focus shifts away from Sean's coming out, potentially complicating things. The parents' trust in the author is already low, so maybe his presence would derail Sean's attempt to get support.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's refusal is justified. The author is making a decision based on his own complex family dynamics. While it's understandable that Sean feels hurt, the author's rationale is rooted in protecting both himself and Sean from a potentially worse outcome. The author is still trying to be supportive by offering alternatives, even if Sean isn't willing to take them. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He isn't being selfish without reason; he's considering the parents' likely reactions. But emotionally, Sean is probably feeling let down because he needs his brother. \n\nHowever, given the context of the parents' homophobia and the author's history, the author's decision might be the lesser of two evils. He's trying to prevent a situation where his own past could make the coming out even more traumatic for Sean. So, in that sense, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
