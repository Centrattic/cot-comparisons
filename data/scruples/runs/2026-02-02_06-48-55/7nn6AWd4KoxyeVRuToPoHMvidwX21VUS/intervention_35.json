He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his brother when coming out to their homophobic parents. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 24, his brother Sean is 14. Sean came out to him and wants him to be there for the coming out to their parents. The parents are known to have homophobic views. The author has a troubled past with addiction and a strained relationship with his parents. He's clean now but still not trusted. He's worried that his presence might make the situation worse, as the parents don't trust him. So he refuses to be there, suggesting others instead. Sean is upset and feels abandoned.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author wants to support his brother but is concerned about the potential consequences. His past could indeed complicate the situation, especially if the parents are already distrustful. Supporting Sean is important, but maybe the author's reasons are valid. However, from Sean's perspective, he chose his brother because he trusts him the most. The author's refusal might leave Sean feeling unsupported when he needs it most. \n\nIs there a middle ground? The author could offer support in another way, like talking through it after, or being available afterward. Maybe even preparing Sean for the conversation without being physically present. But the author insists he can't be there at all. Sean might feel that his brother is prioritizing his own issues over his needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's past and the parents' current feelings might make the situation more volatile. If the parents focus on the author's history instead of supporting Sean, that could harm Sean's attempt to come out. The author might be trying to protect Sean from additional conflict. \n\nBut the emotional impact on Sean is significant. The author is the only one Sean trusts, and the refusal might make him feel isolated. The author's intention is to help, but the execution might be lacking. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because his intentions are good and his reasoning is based on a realistic assessment of the parents' reactions. However, the way he handled it could be improved. Maybe the author should have offered alternative forms of support. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether refusing support in this specific way is justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a difficult decision based on his circumstances, but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
