He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, the author is 24, and Sean is 14. The brother has come out to the author and wants the author to be there when he tells their parents. The parents have expressed anti-LGBTQ+ views. The author's refusal is based on their strained relationship with the parents and their past issues with addiction and stealing, which have caused a lot of distrust. The author fears that their presence might make the situation worse, shifting focus from Sean to themselves. Sean got upset, feeling abandoned, and now they're not talking.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. So, the question is whether the author's decision is wrong or not.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, Sean needs support, especially from someone who understands and accepts him. Being there could provide emotional support and show solidarity. On the other hand, the author is concerned that their history might complicate the situation, making it harder for Sean. The parents don't trust the author, so if Sean is already in a vulnerable position, the author's presence might lead the parents to dismiss Sean's coming out or even blame the author for influencing him. The author is prioritizing Sean's safety and the effectiveness of the conversation, thinking that their presence could be counterproductive. \n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. Sean feels rejected, which is understandable. The author offered alternatives, like involving another trusted person, but Sean didn't accept that. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but Sean still feels hurt. The author's refusal might be seen as not being there for their brother when he needs it most, which could damage their relationship further.\n\nHowever, the author's intention isn't to abandon Sean but to prevent a potential disaster. They genuinely want to help but believe their presence might do more harm than good. The key question is whether refusing support in this case makes the author wrong. It's a tough call because both the intention and the outcome are important. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not a clear-cut answer. The author is trying to protect Sean from potential backlash from the parents if they're present, which could lead to the parents focusing on the author's past instead of Sean's identity. But by refusing, the author is also not providing direct support, which Sean desperately needs. The author's alternatives might not be sufficient if Sean doesn't trust others as much. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because their decision is based on protecting Sean from a potentially worse situation. However, they could have tried to find another way to support Sean indirectly, like being available afterward for emotional support or helping with a plan. But given the circumstances, the author's refusal is a difficult but reasoned choice, not necessarily the wrong one.\n"
