He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe author, who is 24, has a 14-year-old brother named Sean. Sean came out to him a few months ago and asked him to be there when he tells their parents. The parents are known to have homophobic views, which is a big deal. The author, however, doesn't have a good relationship with the parents. He had a history of addiction, stole from people, and his parents don't trust him. He's been clean for two years but still faces distrust. He's worried that if he's present during Sean's coming out, the focus might shift to his past issues instead of supporting Sean. Sean got upset and thinks his brother isn't being there for him. The author offered alternatives but Sean still wants him there.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, Sean needs support and trust from his brother, who is the only one he's come out to. The author is making a decision based on his own history with the parents, thinking it might complicate things for Sean. On the other hand, the parents are already homophobic, so maybe Sean needs someone who's more trusted by them to be present. But the author is trying to protect Sean by not causing more conflict. Also, the author is offering alternatives, like other family members or friends. But Sean doesn't want anyone else. The author is in a tough spot because he wants to help but fears making things worse. It's possible that the author is just trying to be realistic about how his presence might not help Sean in this specific situation. The parents already distrust him, so maybe he's right to step back. However, the emotional impact on Sean is significant; he feels abandoned. \n\nBut is the author at fault? The key points are: the author is being honest about his limitations, he's not refusing to support his brother in general but is concerned about the specific context, and he's suggested other options. The author's reasons are valid because he's considering the parents' potential reaction. However, the brother might feel that the author isn't there for him when he needs support the most. But given the author's history, maybe this is a selfless decision. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a tough choice based on his knowledge of the parents and his own past, even though it's hurting their relationship. Alternatively, if the author could have found another way to support Sean without being present, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he's not supporting the immediate request might be seen as wrong. Hmm. I think the key is that he's not refusing to support, just refusing to be the one to go with him because of potential negative consequences. So B.\n"
