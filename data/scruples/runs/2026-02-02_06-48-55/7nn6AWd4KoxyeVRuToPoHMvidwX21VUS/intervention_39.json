He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. Let me start by going through the details.\n\nThe author is 24, his brother is 14. The brother came out to him four months ago, and he's the only one who knows. The parents are homophobic, so when the brother wants to come out, he asks the author to be there. The author refuses because of his past with the parents. He had a history of addiction, bad behavior, stole from people, and lost their trust. Now, even though he's clean for two years, the parents don't trust him. The author is worried that his presence might make the situation worse with the parents, shifting focus to him. The brother is upset and feels abandoned, not responding to texts. The author is trying to explain his reasons but the brother is hurt.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the brother is 14. That's a vulnerable age, coming out to parents who are already opposed. The brother trusts the author as the only person who knows. The author's refusal might leave the brother feeling unsupported, which could be really harmful. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons: the parents don't trust him anymore, and his presence could complicate the situation. If the parents are already biased against the brother's sexuality, adding the author's past issues might make them react negatively, not just to the brother's coming out but also to the author. \n\nBut is refusing to support the brother the right move? The author could offer support in other ways. Maybe not being physically present but still being a listening ear, helping him prepare, or connecting him with another trusted adult. The brother might need reassurance that even if the author isn't there in person, he's still supportive. The author says he offered suggesting other people, but the brother trusts him the most. So maybe the author should have found a middle ground, like being there emotionally while not attending the conversation in person. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that being present could escalate the situation. If the parents are hostile, having someone they distrust could make things worse for the brother. The author's past actions have made the parents distrust him, so their focus might shift from the brother's coming out to the author's presence. That could be a valid concern. But the brother is in a tough spot, needing support. The author's refusal might make him feel isolated. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's not there at all, maybe. But the brother is upset because he wanted the author there. Maybe the author should have found alternative support for the brother while still being emotionally available. The key is whether the author's refusal is justified. The author is trying to protect the brother by not being present, but the brother feels abandoned. \n\nI think it's a tough spot. The author isn't wrong in his reasoning, but perhaps could have handled it better. Maybe by explaining more thoroughly and offering alternative ways to support. But if the author genuinely believes that his presence would make things worse, then maybe it's not his fault. However, the brother is in a vulnerable position and needs support. The author's refusal, even if with good intentions, might still be seen as not being supportive enough. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether the author's reasons are valid. If his presence would indeed make the situation worse, then he's not in the wrong. But if he could have found a way to support the brother without being physically present, maybe he is. The problem is that the brother feels he has no one else. The author could have connected him with another supportive figure, even if he's not there. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't adequately provide other forms of support. The answer might be AITA, but maybe not. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because his reasoning is based on wanting to prevent a worse outcome. However, he should have done more to ensure the brother isn't left without support. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that he could have handled it better. But according to the strict question, the answer is either A or B. Since the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the analysis shows complexities, maybe the answer is B.\n"
