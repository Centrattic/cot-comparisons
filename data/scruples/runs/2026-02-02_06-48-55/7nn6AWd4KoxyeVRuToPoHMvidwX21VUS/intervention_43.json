He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 24-year-old sibling whose 14-year-old brother wants to come out to their parents and is asking for support. The author's parents are described as having homophobic views, like disapproving of marriage equality and considering being gay a sickness. The author has a history of addiction and bad behavior, leading to a loss of trust from the parents. They went off the grid, stole from people, and their parents still don't trust them even after two years of sobriety.\n\nThe author says they tried to explain to their brother that being present during the coming out might make things worse and shift the focus to them. The brother is upset and feels abandoned because he trusts the author the most. The author offered alternatives, like coming out to another relative or a friend first, but the brother insists on the author's presence.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing. Let's break it down. The brother is 14 and likely scared. He needs support from someone reliable. The author is the only one he's told so far, which shows a level of trust. However, the author is concerned about their parent's perception because of their past. The author's reasoning is that their presence might cause the parents to focus on their own issues instead of supporting the brother.\n\nBut the key here is that the brother is relying on the author for support. Even if the author has their own issues, refusing might leave the brother without the support he needs. The author might not be the best person to support him given the parents' distrust of them, but are they in the wrong for not wanting to be there? It's a tricky situation. The author is prioritizing potentially protecting their brother from an angry reaction from the parents, but the brother feels let down. \n\nThe author could be wrong if the brother's emotional need for support outweighs the potential risks. However, if the author's presence would indeed make the parents' reaction more negative or cause a derailment, then maybe it's a valid concern. The author also offered alternatives, but the brother didn't accept. The author's intention is to protect the brother, but the method might be flawed. It's possible the author should have found a better way to be supportive, maybe by being available afterward to talk or help with another approach. But given the parents' likely reaction and the author's history, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the author is able to provide the necessary support despite their past, or if the refusal is justified to prevent further conflict with the parents. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they are being honest about their limitations and the potential negative impact their presence might have. It's better for the brother to approach the parents when he has a better chance of being heard without the author's past issues complicating the situation. The author is still trying to help by suggesting other options, even if the brother didn't accept. The author's intention is supportive, but the method is based on realistic concerns. So the answer is B.\n"
