He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the older brother) is in the wrong for refusing to help his younger brother come out to their homophobic parents. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Sean, is 14 and has come out to the author, who is 24. The parents are known to be homophobic, so Sean wants support. The author refuses because his relationship with the parents is bad due to past issues with addiction and theft. He's concerned that his presence would make things worse, shifting the focus away from Sean's coming out. Sean is upset and feels abandoned.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's reasoning is based on his past behavior and the fact that the parents don't trust him. If he were there, the parents might bring up his past, which could complicate the situation for Sean. His intention is to protect Sean by not being a distraction. But Sean feels he needs his older brother's support, especially given the parents' attitude towards LGBTQ+ people.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's making a choice based on his own experiences and trying to mitigate potential negative outcomes. He's not being selfish; he's trying to be strategic. However, from Sean's perspective, he might feel that his brother isn't there when he needs him most. The author isn't refusing because of homophobia but because of the risk of the situation spiraling into his own issues. \n\nThe author also offers alternatives, like suggesting Sean talk to someone else, but Sean doesn't want that. The author is prioritizing Sean's well-being by not wanting to complicate the coming out with his own history. So, while the refusal might hurt Sean, the author's decision is based on his own past and trying to avoid making things worse for his brother. \n\nI think the answer is B, not in the wrong. He's trying to help from a different angle, even though it's hard for Sean to see right now. His intentions are good, and the conflict is more about differing perspectives on how to handle the situation.\n"
