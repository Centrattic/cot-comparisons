He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The author has a history of addiction and bad behavior that caused a rift with the parents. They feel their presence might make the situation worse.\n\nFirst, the brother Sean needs support. He's 14 and really nervous. The author is the only one he's told so far. The parents are known to be homophobic, so this is a big moment for Sean. The author is worried that being there would shift the focus to their past issues and make the parents more upset, which could make things harder for Sean. \n\nBut from Sean's perspective, he trusted his brother the most and expected that support. The author is trying to protect their own relationship with the parents, but maybe they're not considering how important this is for Sean. The author offered alternatives, like going with a friend or an aunt, but Sean didn't want that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's reasoning is valid\u2014they don't want to add to the tension. However, being the only person Sean trusts, the author's refusal might make him feel abandoned. The author is trying to be supportive in a different way, but maybe they should have found another way to support Sean without being present. \n\nBut the key is the author's intent. They do want to support Sean, just in a way they think is safer. But maybe the brother feels like he needs the author's presence specifically. The author might be right in thinking their presence could complicate things, but is that a good enough reason to not be there? It's a tough call. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a valid concern, but maybe they could have done more to reassure Sean or offer more alternatives. However, the answer here is to determine if they're in the wrong. Since the author is trying to help in their own way and the situation is complicated, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted. The author's motives are good, but the brother's feelings are hurt. Still, the author's actions might be the right choice for the bigger picture.\n"
