He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 24, their brother Sean is 14. The brother came out to the author four months ago and now wants the author to be there with him when he tells their parents. The author has a troubled history with their parents due to addiction and stealing, which led to a loss of trust. The parents don't trust the author and have negative views on the LGBTQ+ community. The author thinks their presence might make things worse for Sean because the focus would shift to their own past issues, making the situation more complicated. Sean is upset and feels abandoned, but the author believes they're doing the right thing by not being there.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's concern about their strained relationship with parents, the parents' hostility towards LGBTQ+ issues, and the potential for their presence to complicate Sean's coming out. The author is trying to protect Sean by not adding another layer of conflict, even though it's emotionally hard for both of them.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Being in the wrong would mean that their refusal is unjustified. But the author is making a decision based on their judgment that their presence could make things worse. They offered alternative solutions, like having someone else support Sean. The brother feels hurt and abandoned, but the author's reasoning is that it's in Sean's best interest. However, the brother feels that the author is the only one who can support him, and the author's refusal might leave him without the support he needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be right in thinking that their presence would complicate things. If the parents are already distrustful of the author, the coming out might be overshadowed by old grievances. The author's intention is to protect Sean, even if it means being absent. The brother's emotional reaction is valid, but the author's decision is based on practical concerns.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They're trying to act in their brother's best interest but are being rejected by the brother. The author's reasoning is logical, but the emotional impact on the brother is significant. However, the author isn't refusing to support Sean entirely; they're just saying it's not the right time or situation for them to be present. They also offered alternatives. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because their decision is made with the intention of minimizing potential harm, even if it's painful for the brother.\n"
