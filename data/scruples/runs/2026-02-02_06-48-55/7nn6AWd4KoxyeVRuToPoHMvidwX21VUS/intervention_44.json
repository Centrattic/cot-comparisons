He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The author has a complicated history with their parents, including addiction and a breakdown in trust. The brother is 14 and wants his older brother's support. The author thinks their presence might make the situation worse by shifting the focus to their past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves their brother and has supported them, but the context is their strained relationship with the parents. The parents are homophobic, so coming out could be traumatic. The author's presence might be counterproductive if the parents are already distrustful. The brother feels the author is the only one he trusts, but the author is concerned about their own past causing more problems.\n\nThe author is trying to protect their brother from a situation that could escalate because of their own history. However, the brother feels abandoned. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The author's reasoning is that they want to help but think their presence might hinder the process. On the other hand, the brother needs emotional support, and the author's refusal might leave him feeling unsupported.\n\nI should consider the intent. The author isn't rejecting their brother's sexuality but is making a decision based on their belief that being there would be harmful. However, the brother might not see the rationale and feels hurt. There's a balance between being supportive and being realistic about the situation. The author is suggesting alternative steps, but the brother might not have those options. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel wronged when their support is refused, even if the reasons are valid. The author's decision could be seen as not standing by their sibling in a crucial moment. But then again, maybe it's a protective measure. However, the brother is in a vulnerable position, and the author's absence could make him feel even more isolated. \n\nI think the key is whether there's a valid reason for the refusal. The author has a history that could indeed complicate things. But the brother might not have anyone else. The author's offer of other options (like aunts or friends) wasn't accepted. The brother might not have those options available. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they genuinely believe their presence will make things worse, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the brother needs them and the author is refusing, even if for good reason, it could still be seen as a failure to support. The answer might depend on the specific dynamics and whether there are other viable options. Since the brother says he has no one else, the author's refusal might be seen as not providing support when it's most needed, hence being in the wrong. But if the author's presence would indeed exacerbate the situation, maybe they are right. This is a tough one. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're making a decision to prevent further conflict, but others might argue they should have found a way to support their brother differently.\n"
