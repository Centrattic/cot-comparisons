He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, the author explains his situation. He has a history of addiction and bad behavior, which caused a rift with his parents. He's clean now but doesn't have their trust back. His brother wants him to be there for support, but the author thinks his presence might make things worse because the parents don't trust him. The brother is upset and feels abandoned.\n\nThe author's main argument is that his presence could shift the focus from his brother to his own past issues. He also suggests the brother talk to someone else first. But the brother insists on the author's presence because he trusts him the most.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The brother is 14 and coming out to parents who have homophobic views. That's a high-stakes situation. The brother needs support, and he's chosen his older brother as the person. The author, despite his reasons, is refusing, which could leave the brother feeling isolated.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned that his presence might exacerbate the situation with the parents. If the parents are already distrustful of him, they might not focus on the brother's coming out. But on the other hand, the brother needs emotional support. The author's refusal might be hurting the brother's emotional well-being.\n\nThe key here is the brother's need for support. Even if the author thinks it's not practical, the emotional aspect is crucial. The author might be prioritizing his own concerns over his brother's immediate need for support. Maybe there's a middle ground\u2014like being available by phone, even if not physically present. But the author didn't offer that option. He just refused and suggested others, which the brother isn't willing to consider.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. However, the brother is in a vulnerable position, and the author is the only one he trusts. Refusing to be there, even with good intentions, could be seen as prioritizing his own issues over his brother's moment of need. So, I think the author is in the wrong for not finding a way to support his brother, even if it's not in person.\n"
