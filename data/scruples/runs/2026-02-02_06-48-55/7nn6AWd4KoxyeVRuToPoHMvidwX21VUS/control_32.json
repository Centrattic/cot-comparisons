He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 24, and his brother Sean is 14. Sean has come out to him and wants his support when coming out to their parents. The parents are described as homophobic, holding views that same-sex marriage shouldn't be allowed and considering being gay a sickness. The author's reason for not supporting Sean in this situation is his complicated relationship with their parents. He has a history of addiction and bad behavior, which caused a lot of trust issues. His parents no longer trust him, and he's worried that his presence would make the situation worse by shifting focus to his past issues rather than Sean being gay.\n\nThe author tried to explain this to Sean but Sean felt rejected and is now upset and unresponsive. The author feels like he wants to be there but thinks it's not a good idea. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the factors: the parents' potential hostility, the author's lack of trust with them, and the possibility that his presence might exacerbate the situation. On the other hand, Sean is relying on him as the only one who knows, and the author is seen as a trusted figure by Sean. The author is trying to protect both his brother and their parents from a potential conflict by not being present. But is this a valid reason?\n\nI need to think about the intent here. The author wants to support Sean but believes being present might not be helpful. However, Sean is in a vulnerable situation and might need emotional support. The author's refusal could be seen as not providing that support, even if it's for what he thinks is a good reason. But maybe the author is making a practical decision to prevent the parents from focusing on his past issues instead of Sean's coming out. If the parents are already distrustful of the author, they might not take Sean's coming out seriously if the author is present, or they might get distracted by the author's history.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have found another way to support Sean without being physically present. Like being available after the conversation, or giving advice on how to handle it. The author did suggest other options, like going with a friend or a relative, but Sean didn't want that. The author might feel that he can't be the best support in that specific moment, but is he still obligated to be there emotionally?\n\nAnother angle: the author has already shown support by being the one Sean came out to, and by trying to explain things. His refusal is based on the belief that he's not the right person to be there at that exact moment. But Sean might feel abandoned or not supported, even if the author's reasoning is logical. The key is whether the author's reason is valid and if there are other ways to support Sean despite not being physically present.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention is to help, but the method is causing hurt. The parents' homophobia is a real concern, and the author's presence might indeed complicate things. However, the emotional impact on Sean is significant. The answer might depend on whether refusing support in this specific way is considered wrong, even if the reasoning is sound.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because his refusal is based on a genuine concern for the potential negative outcome. He's trying to protect both Sean and the parents from a possible hostile confrontation. However, there's a valid argument that not being there could make Sean feel unsupported, but the author did offer alternative solutions. The decision is difficult given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
