He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the older brother) is in the wrong for refusing to support his younger brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The brother has a history of addiction and bad behavior that caused a rift with their parents, and he's concerned his presence might make the situation worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's reasons. He mentions that his relationship with the parents is strained because of his past actions. He doesn't want the focus to shift to him, which could complicate things for his younger brother. On the other hand, the younger brother feels hurt and abandoned. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the brother's intention is to avoid making the situation harder for Sean. If the parents don't trust him and his presence might lead to them dismissing Sean's disclosure, then his refusal could be seen as selfless. But the younger brother needs support, and the author might be the best person to help, despite the parents' issues. \n\nThe brother offered alternatives, like going with a friend or an aunt. That shows he wants to support Sean but isn't sure how to approach the parents. The key is whether the brother is capable of being a stable support despite his past. Since Sean trusts him the most, maybe the brother can still be there emotionally even if the parents react negatively. \n\nBut the brother's concern is valid too. If the parents are already judgmental, maybe his presence could trigger their existing biases or make the conversation about his past instead of Sean. However, the brother could have tried to reassure Sean that he's there in spirit and offer to help in other ways, not just physically present. \n\nI think the brother isn't in the wrong because he's trying to protect his brother from potential worse outcomes. But he could have done more to explain and offer other forms of support instead of just declining. The younger brother's feelings are important, but the older one's past might genuinely make his presence problematic. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but maybe he could improve communication.\n"
