He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The author has a complicated history with their parents due to past addiction issues, which led to a loss of trust. His brother Sean, who's 14, wants support from him but the author feels being there might complicate things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main reason is that their presence might make the situation worse. Their parents don't trust them, so if Sean comes out with him there, the focus might shift to the author's past issues instead of supporting Sean. The author wants to protect his brother from potential negative reactions from their parents.\n\nOn the other hand, Sean is upset because he chose the author as his support person, feeling that he trusts him the most. The author's refusal might make Sean feel abandoned, especially since their parents are already homophobic. The author might be worried about their own relationship with the parents, but Sean needs emotional support right now.\n\nBut wait, the author does offer alternatives, like suggesting Sean talk to a friend or an aunt. That shows they care but don't want to be present. However, Sean might not have someone else he trusts as much. The author's past issues might not directly affect the parents' reaction to Sean's coming out, but the parents already have biases. The author's presence could indeed complicate things, but is there another way to support Sean without being physically present? Maybe through other means like being available afterward.\n\nThe key points are the author's legitimate concerns about the parents' trust issues and the potential for the situation to escalate. However, refusing all support might leave Sean without the immediate emotional backing he needs. The author is trying to protect Sean from a possible worse scenario but isn't providing alternative support, which might leave Sean feeling unsupported.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They have valid reasons but might not be considering Sean's emotional needs. The answer hinges on whether refusing all support is wrong despite the risks. Since the author is still offering alternative solutions but Sean is in need of immediate support, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to prevent a worse outcome. But if the author could find another way to support Sean emotionally without being present, that might be better. However, the question is whether the refusal itself is in the wrong. Given the circumstances, the answer is B (No).\n"
