He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. The author has a complicated history with their parents due to past addiction and bad behavior, leading to a loss of trust. The brother Sean, who is 14, is nervous and wants the author's support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They believe that their presence might complicate the situation, especially since the parents don't trust them. They also mention offering alternatives like having a friend or aunt come instead. However, Sean feels hurt and abandoned, which is significant.\n\nThe author's main argument is that their history might make the parents focus on them rather than Sean's coming out. But is this a valid reason to refuse support? It's possible, but maybe the author could have found a way to be supportive without being physically present. For example, staying nearby and available in case things escalate, or preparing Sean emotionally beforehand.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's own relationship with their parents is strained, and they might not be in a position to handle a potential backlash from the parents without it affecting their own recovery. The author's health and stability is also a factor to consider. However, Sean is young and vulnerable, needing support from someone who's a role model, even if that role model has past issues.\n\nThe key points are: the author's past issues might make their presence problematic, but Sean's emotional needs are pressing. The author offered alternatives but Sean wants them specifically. The author's refusal might be seen as self-preservation, but it's important to consider the impact on Sean's mental health.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a tough call. The author isn't being malicious; they have valid concerns. However, by choosing not to support, they might be leaving Sean without the emotional support he needs. The author could be wrong in not finding a middle ground or not providing enough emotional support through other means. Alternatively, they are protecting themselves and redirecting Sean to other resources, which might be necessary given their personal history.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a gray area. But since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if B (not in the wrong) is the correct answer. The answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is justified given their circumstances. Given that the author's past could indeed complicate things and they offered alternatives, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if Sean needed the support and the author could have found a way, then they might be. However, the author's own well-being and the potential for the parents to focus on their past issues might be a legitimate concern. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
