He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the 24-year-old (the author) has a 14-year-old brother, Sean, who is coming out to their homophobic parents. Sean asked the author to be there as support, but the author declined because of their past with addiction and the parents not trusting them anymore. Now Sean is upset and hasn't responded to the author's texts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. The author has a history of addiction and bad behavior that caused a rift with the parents. The parents don't trust them, and the author is worried that being present during Sean's coming out might make things worse. The author suggests other options, like going with a friend or an aunt, but Sean doesn't trust anyone else.\n\nIs the author's decision justified? Well, the author is trying to protect both Sean and themselves. If the parents are already distrustful of the author, their presence might indeed escalate the situation, making it more about the author's past rather than Sean's coming out. The author wants to ensure that Sean's moment is handled as best as possible, even if they can't be there physically. They also offered alternative solutions, which shows they care about Sean's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, Sean feels abandoned because he trusts his brother the most. The author might feel guilty for not being able to support their sibling in this significant moment. However, the author's reasoning is that their presence could complicate things, and they might not be the best choice to support Sean in this context.\n\nIt's a tough spot. The author is in a position where their past actions have consequences that affect their current ability to help. They're not refusing support out of selfishness but because they genuinely believe it's better for Sean's situation. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in what they think is Sean's best interest, even if it's hard. The answer should be B.\n"
