He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 24, their brother is 14. The brother came out to them and now wants support from the author when confronting their parents, who have expressed anti-LGBTQ+ views. The author has a complicated history with their parents due to past addiction and behavior issues, leading to a loss of trust. The author feels that being present might make things worse between their brother and parents, so they refuse to go with him.\n\nThe brother is upset, feeling abandoned. The author suggested alternatives, like involving a friend or an aunt, but the brother wanted the author specifically. Now the brother isn't responding.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The author's reasoning is that their presence could complicate the situation with parents who already distrust them. The brother, however, needs support and feels the author is the only one he trusts.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect the brother by avoiding a situation that might backfire. On the other hand, the brother is in a vulnerable position and feels the author isn't being supportive. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their own strained relationship with the parents over their brother's need for support. But they also have valid concerns about the parents' reaction to them.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions. They want to help but think their presence might hinder. However, the brother needs emotional support, and the author is the only one he trusts. The author offered alternative solutions, but the brother isn't accepting them yet. Maybe the author could find a middle ground, like being available after the fact or providing support in another way. But the author's refusal isn't out of selfishness; it's based on past experiences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation is complex. The author isn't being intentionally harmful but is making a judgment call. The brother's feelings are valid, but the author's concerns might be justified. So, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. They're trying to help but can't be there, which might make them not in the wrong. Alternatively, they could be wrong for not finding another way to support even if they can't be present. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's decision is based on real issues and they offered alternatives. But they might need to find a way to be supportive in other ways to mend the relationship with their brother.\n"
