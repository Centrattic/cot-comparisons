He came out to me around 4 months ago and I\u2019m the only one he has told so far. I\u2019ve always loved him no matter what and I really don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. We\u2019ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he\u2019s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn\u2019t be able to marry, it\u2019s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he\u2019s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn\u2019t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn\u2019t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don\u2019t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn\u2019t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he\u2019s not completely in the dark, he doesn\u2019t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don\u2019t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn\u2019t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I\u2019m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI\u2019ve tried texting him but he won\u2019t respond to anything I say. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not supporting his brother when he comes out to their homophobic parents. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is 24, and his brother is 14. The brother came out to him four months ago, and they've gotten closer since then. The brother wants the author to be there when he tells their parents, who have expressed homophobic views. The author has a troubled past with addiction, stealing, and lost trust with the parents. He's been clean for two years but the parents still don't trust him. The author thinks his presence might make things worse because the parents don't trust him, and he doesn't want the focus to shift to him. The brother is upset and feels the author isn't supporting him. The author tried suggesting other options, but the brother didn't accept them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I should consider the brother's perspective. He's 14, coming out to parents who are hostile, and he wants support. The author is the only one who knows, and he's refusing to be there. The brother might feel abandoned, especially since he chose the author because he trusts him the most. The author's reasoning is that his presence could make things worse because the parents don't trust him and might get distracted by his past issues. But is that a valid reason to refuse support?\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be protecting himself and his brother. If the parents are already hostile towards the brother's sexuality, adding the author's past issues could complicate the situation. The author might not want to put the brother in a worse position by having someone the parents distrust present. However, the brother might need a strong ally to help him through the process, and the author is the only one he trusts. The author is offering alternatives, like going to an aunt or a friend, but the brother doesn't want to take that route.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is prioritizing his relationship with the parents over his brother's needs. But given his history, maybe he's right to think that his presence could derail the brother's coming out. However, the brother might not have the emotional maturity to handle it alone, especially with the parents being hostile. The author's refusal could leave the brother without any support, which is risky.\n\nI need to weigh the potential harm of the author's presence against the harm of him not being there. If the parents react negatively to the brother's sexuality, having the author there might not help, but it might also not be helpful to have the author not there. The brother might feel more confident with the author present. The author's past issues might not directly relate to the coming out, but the parents' existing distrust could cause them to focus on that instead of the brother's statement. However, the brother's immediate need for support is critical.\n\nThe author could also be wrong in assuming that his presence would definitely make things worse. Maybe the parents, despite their biases, could be more focused on the brother's coming out if the author is there as a supportive figure. But if the parents are already distrustful, maybe the author's presence complicates things. It's a tough call.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the brother's sibling and might feel a duty to support him. However, the author is also considering the potential negative consequences. The brother might not have the emotional strength to do this alone, especially with hostile parents. The author is trying to protect both himself and his brother, but the brother perceives it as abandonment.\n\nI think the key points are: the brother's need for support vs. the author's self-preservation and concern for the brother's well-being. The author is not outright wrong, but maybe he could have found a middle ground. For example, offering to talk to the parents beforehand to ease tensions or providing support in a different way. But given the circumstances, the author's decision might be reasonable. However, the brother's emotional need for his brother might make the author's refusal seem like he's in the wrong.\n\nWait, but the author does offer alternatives. Maybe if the brother is not willing to take them, the author is doing the best he can. Still, the brother feels hurt. The author might be in the right by protecting his own position, but the brother's perspective is important too. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, if the author is the only one the brother trusts, refusing might not be the best choice. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not providing the support the brother needs, even if it's difficult.\n"
