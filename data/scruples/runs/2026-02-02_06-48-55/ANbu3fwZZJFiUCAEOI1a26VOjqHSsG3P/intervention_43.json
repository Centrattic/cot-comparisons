I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex, who she's still close with, but the author is uncomfortable with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's argument is that naming their son after a previous relationship makes him uncomfortable. He doesn't want their son to know he's named after someone else the mom loved before him. The girlfriend counters by saying the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of death, so it's just a tribute to a friend.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and emotional impact. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable about naming their child after someone else, especially if it's from a past relationship. Naming a child is a significant decision, and both parents should agree. However, the girlfriend's request is to honor someone she's still connected to, which might have emotional importance for her family.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for refusing? Well, he's not wrong to prioritize his feelings here. It's a personal decision, and he's not obligated to name the child after someone he's not comfortable with. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her ex is important to her family and that the name is a way to honor a friend. However, since the ex is deceased and the relationship at the time of death wasn't romantic, the author's discomfort is valid. The main issue is whether it's fair to name a child after someone who isn't part of the current relationship. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he has the right to express his discomfort and make a decision based on his feelings. The girlfriend's request is about honoring her past, but the author's feelings about the son's name matter too. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
