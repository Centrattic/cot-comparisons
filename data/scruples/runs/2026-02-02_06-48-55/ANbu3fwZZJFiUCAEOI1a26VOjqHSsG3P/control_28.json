I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple expecting a child, and the girlfriend wants their son's middle name to be that of her ex, who has passed away. The author is against it, feeling uncomfortable with the idea of their son being partly named after someone else the mother loved before them. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend who died, not a romantic partner, and that it's important for his family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's discomfort is understandable. Naming a child after an ex, even a deceased one, could lead to questions and potential complications for the child. The girlfriend's reasoning is that she still wants to honor the ex's family, and she's close with them. However, the author is the one who will be raising the child, so his feelings should matter.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. Both partners should agree on major decisions like a child's name. The author is not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and refusing to go along with a name choice that makes him uneasy. The girlfriend's ex was a past relationship, and moving forward, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding the child's name. Even if the ex was a friend, the author's objection is valid because it's about their shared child.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that they weren't together when the ex died might alleviate some concerns, but the symbolic act of naming still carries weight. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting to honor someone else's memory in that way. It's a personal choice, and the couple needs to find a compromise that respects both their feelings. Since the author clearly communicated his stance and stands by it, he isn't the asshole in this scenario.\n"
