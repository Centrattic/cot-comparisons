Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name for her ex, who's deceased, and she's close with his family. The author is uncomfortable because he doesn't want the son to be named after someone the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was more of a friend, not a romantic partner.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is about naming the child after an ex-partner who has passed away. The author's concern is understandable because naming a child after a previous romantic partner might cause feelings of jealousy or insecurity. However, the ex is deceased, which adds another layer. The girlfriend's family is still close with them, so it's important for her to honor the memory of the ex.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable. Naming a child is a significant decision, and it's natural to want to avoid any emotional baggage. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that honoring the memory of a deceased person is important, especially if the family is still part of her life. The ex was a friend, not a romantic partner anymore at the time of death, which could mitigate some of the author's concerns.\n\nBut wait, the author's main objection is about the son being partly named after someone the mom loved before him. Even though the ex was a friend, the connection might still be sensitive. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's about honoring a friend and keeping ties with her family. The author might not feel comfortable with that, and it's a valid feeling. However, the girlfriend's request is about her emotional needs and family connections.\n\nIs it the author's place to say no? Well, the child's name is a joint decision. If the author is uncomfortable, he has the right to express that. However, if the girlfriend is insistent, it might become a conflict. The key here is whether the author's refusal is justified or if he's overstepping. Since the ex is deceased and the name is for the child's middle name, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the girlfriend's emotional needs and family ties are also valid. \n\nI think the author is not entirely wrong because he has a right to his feelings, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how the situation is framed. Since the ex is a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of death, the author's discomfort is less about a current ex and more about a past relationship. Still, the author's feelings are legitimate. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
