The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name for the ex's family's sake, but the author is uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's ex is deceased, and she wants to honor him, possibly for her family's closure. On the other hand, the author is the father-to-be and feels it's not right to have the child's name tied to another man. \n\nMarriage and naming a child involve joint decisions. If one partner is strongly against it, that's valid. The author's discomfort is understandable. Naming a child is a lifelong commitment for the child, so it's important both parents agree. The girlfriend's argument about the ex being a friend might not resonate if the author perceives it as honoring a past relationship. \n\nThe key factors here are mutual agreement in parenting decisions and the author's right to his feelings. While honoring a deceased person can be respectful, it shouldn't come at the expense of one parent's comfort. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
