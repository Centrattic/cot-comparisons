The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author is against it, while the girlfriend is in favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is uncomfortable having their son's middle name be their girlfriend's ex. They feel it's a bit strange because it's another man the mother loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend who died and that the family still wants to honor him. She's not even sure if they were still together when he died. \n\nNow, the author's reasoning is about their own feelings and how they don't want their son to be named after someone else. It's important to respect one's feelings in a relationship. Naming a child is a big decision and both parents should have a say. The girlfriend is making a request that makes the author uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend has her reasons, including family ties and honoring a deceased friend. \n\nBut the key here is the author's right to refuse. If the author is not in the wrong, it's because they have the right to express their discomfort and set boundaries regarding their child's name. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's request is reasonable and the author is being unreasonable, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But the author's feelings are valid. They don't want to give a name that could cause future issues or personal discomfort. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of death. That might mitigate some of the author's concerns. However, the author still feels it's a bad idea. Since naming a child is a joint decision, the author has a right to voice their opinion and refuse something that makes them uncomfortable. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing by their decision. They have the right to prioritize their feelings and the child's identity. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
