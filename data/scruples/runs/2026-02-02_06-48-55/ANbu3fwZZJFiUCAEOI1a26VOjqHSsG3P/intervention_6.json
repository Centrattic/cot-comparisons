The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about naming a son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author is uncomfortable with the idea because it feels like the child is named after someone else the mother loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend and that it's important to her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of each person. The author feels hurt and that their feelings aren't being respected. The girlfriend wants to honor her deceased ex, possibly for family reasons. But the author is the father-to-be, so his feelings about the naming should matter too. Naming a child often involves both parents' preferences, so it's reasonable for the author to have a say.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that the ex was a friend might not resonate with the author's emotional response. Even if they weren't together when the ex died, the name connects to a past relationship, which could create confusion or emotional discomfort for the child later. The author's discomfort is valid because he doesn't want his son to be associated with someone else's former partner.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that honoring her friend and maintaining family ties is important. But in this case, the author is the parent who will co-parent with her, so his feelings about the naming decision are significant. It's about mutual respect and compromise. If the author refuses, the girlfriend needs to consider his feelings. Conversely, if the author is overly dismissive of her reasons without trying to find a compromise, that could be the issue.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is the one who said \"no\" and felt it was a bad idea. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to name the child after the ex. Since the author's feelings are valid and the decision should involve both parents, it's a matter of whether there's a middle ground. However, the author is within his rights to express discomfort and not agree to the name. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor her friend without involving the child's name. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing by his decision.\n"
