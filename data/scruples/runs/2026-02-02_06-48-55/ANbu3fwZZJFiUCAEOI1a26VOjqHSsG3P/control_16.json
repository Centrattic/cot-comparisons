Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend are expecting a son. She wants the middle name to be her ex's name, who died. She mentions it's important to her ex's family, whom she's still close with. The author is uncomfortable because he doesn't want their son to be named after someone else he's not. She argues that the ex was a friend who died, not a romantic partner at the time of death. The author says no and feels it's a bad request. The user is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Naming a child is a big decision. Both partners usually have input. The author's feelings are valid; he doesn't want to mix his son's identity with another man's name. The girlfriend has her reasons, wanting to honor the ex and the family. But the author feels it's not right. \n\nLegally and culturally, parents have the right to choose names, but in a relationship, mutual agreement is usually expected. The girlfriend's ex is deceased, but she wants to honor him. The author is a parent, so his input should matter. The girlfriend might need to consider his feelings here. \n\nBut maybe the ex was close, and she feels it's important. However, the author's discomfort is about his child's name. If they can't agree, maybe they need to find a middle ground. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings and boundaries. It's reasonable to not want a child's name to honor someone else's past. His argument is valid. The girlfriend should respect his feelings, but the author isn't wrong for saying no. So the answer would be B.\n"
