Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be her ex's, a man she still has a connection with, even though they weren't together when he died. The author is uncomfortable because he doesn't want the child to be named after someone else he's not related to. The girlfriend argues that it's just a friend, but the author feels it's inappropriate.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, emotional comfort, and the implications for the child. The author is the one who would be directly affected by this naming decision, as the child's name is a lifelong identifier. He has the right to feel uncomfortable about having his son's name include someone else's name, especially someone with whom the mother previously had a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's ex is deceased, but the fact that she's still close to his family adds another layer. The author might be concerned about the implications of the child being associated with this ex, even if the ex and girlfriend were not together at the time of death. The author's refusal isn't about the ex's death itself but about the emotional and symbolic significance of naming the child after someone else.\n\nIn such situations, both partners' feelings need to be considered, but the decision ultimately affects the child. The author isn't being unreasonable in expressing discomfort. The girlfriend might need to respect the author's feelings, especially since the ex is not a parent or a family member directly involved in the child's life. The author isn't the asshole for standing his ground here. So, the answer would be B for No.\n"
