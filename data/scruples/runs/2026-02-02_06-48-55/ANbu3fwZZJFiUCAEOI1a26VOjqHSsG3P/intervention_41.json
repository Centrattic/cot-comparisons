The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex, who's deceased. She mentions it's important for his family, and she's still close with them. The author objects because he doesn't want their son to be partly named after someone else his mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that since they weren't together when the ex died, it's just a friend.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in relationships and honoring the deceased. The author is concerned about the emotional implications for their son and himself. Naming a child after someone else, especially a past relationship, can be a sensitive issue. However, the girlfriend is advocating for her late ex's recognition and family ties. \n\nThe author's main argument is about feeling uncomfortable and not wanting to associate their child with another man. The girlfriend's stance is that the ex is now just a friend. There's a conflict between respecting each other's feelings and family obligations. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for having feelings about this. It's reasonable to have concerns about how this might affect their son. On the other hand, the girlfriend has her own reasons tied to her past and family. However, the author isn't the one who's necessarily in the wrong. It's more about mutual respect and finding a compromise. The question is whether the author's refusal is unjustified. Since the ex is deceased and the relationship ended before his death, the author's discomfort is valid, but so is the girlfriend's wish to honor her friend. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, both sides have valid points. However, the author is not in the wrong for not wanting to proceed, as it's a personal choice and the request might infringe on his comfort. So, the answer is B.\n"
