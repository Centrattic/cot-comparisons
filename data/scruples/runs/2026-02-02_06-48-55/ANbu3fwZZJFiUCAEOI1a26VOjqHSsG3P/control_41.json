I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex, who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name for her ex, but the author is uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's concern is about his son being named after someone the mother loved before him. It could cause confusion or hurt. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend and that the family is important. She might see it as honoring a deceased loved one and maintaining family ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to be uncomfortable. A child's name is a significant decision that affects them for life. Naming a child after an ex, even deceased, might imply a level of significance that the author doesn't want to acknowledge. There's also the aspect of the author's feelings and the potential impact on the child's identity.\n\nI should also think about common practices. Usually, parents don't name children after former partners, even deceased ones, unless it's a very close family friend. The girlfriend's ex was a romantic partner, which adds another layer. The author's refusal might be about protecting his own feelings and the child's future.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could compromise by not using the ex's full name or finding another way to honor the deceased. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's standing by his decision because of his discomfort and the potential implications, it's a valid stance. The girlfriend's argument is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to agree. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
