The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The user provided a Reddit-style story where the author is uncomfortable with the idea of their son having the ex's name as a middle name, even though the ex is deceased and the girlfriend is close with his family. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend and not someone they were together with at the time of his death.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key points here are: the name choice is a personal decision that affects both partners, the ex is dead, the family is important to the girlfriend, and the author feels uncomfortable. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid right to feel uncomfortable about naming their child after someone they weren't close to, especially since it's the other person's ex. It could lead to complicated family dynamics and potential emotional issues for the child later on. The author's hesitation might stem from wanting to avoid any future confusion or negative feelings the child might have about being named after someone else's former partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend wants to honor her friend's memory and maintain a positive relationship with his family. She argues that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of his death. It's important to her that the child carries this name as a tribute. However, the author's refusal might be seen as dismissive of her wishes and her family ties.\n\nBut naming a child is a significant decision that both parents should agree on. The author is within their rights to express discomfort and refuse if the situation makes them uneasy. The girlfriend might need to respect the author's boundaries. However, the way the author expressed their discomfort\u2014calling it \"pretty shitty\"\u2014could be seen as harsh, but the core issue is their refusal. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend is insistent and the author refuses without considering compromise, maybe. But if the author has a legitimate reason to feel this way and the girlfriend is overstepping by pushing for the name, then the author is justified. The key here is mutual respect and communication. Since the author is firm in their refusal and the girlfriend is still pushing, maybe there's a need for more discussion, but the initial refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the author isn't wrong because they have the right to set boundaries in their own parenting decisions.\n"
