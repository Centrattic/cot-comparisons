The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The situation is about naming a child, which can be a sensitive topic.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name, even though they weren't together when he died. She says it would mean a lot to his family, and she's still close with them. The author is uncomfortable because he doesn't want their son to be associated with the ex, who the mom loved before him.\n\nSo, the author says no, feels it's uncomfortable, and the girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend. The author is labeled as the one being difficult. Now, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has the right to be uncomfortable about naming their child after someone else the mother was in a relationship with. It's a personal choice and can affect the child's identity. On the other hand, the girlfriend is honoring her ex's memory and family, which is understandable. But since the ex is deceased and they aren't currently in a relationship, the author's hesitation makes sense. The key point is mutual respect in decision-making. The author isn't being unreasonable for not wanting to proceed with the name, especially considering the ex's role in the mother's past. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
