The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about naming a child after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author says they're uncomfortable with the middle name and refused. The girlfriend argues it's to honor the ex's family, but the author feels it's bad because the ex was loved before them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple is expecting a child, which is a big deal. Names are important for parents, but they also have to agree. The girlfriend wants to honor someone important to her, which she's still close with. The author is against it because it might confuse the child or imply the ex is still significant in their relationship.\n\nThe key points are: the ex is deceased, the girlfriend still has a relationship with the family, and the author's discomfort. The girlfriend is trying to honor someone, but the author feels it's inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author's feelings are valid\u2014naming a child after an ex can be seen as problematic, especially if it's someone they loved before the current partner. However, the girlfriend is trying to honor someone's memory and maintain family ties. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. I think the author is not wrong here. They have the right to express discomfort about naming their child after someone the girlfriend had a past relationship with. It's a personal decision, and the author should have a say in their child's name. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor the ex without it affecting their child's identity. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't wrong for not wanting to name their son after the ex. It's a reasonable stance given the potential emotional implications for both the child and the author.\n"
