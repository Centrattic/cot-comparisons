The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name his son after the girlfriend's ex. The situation is that they're expecting a son, and the girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex's name, who died. She says it would mean a lot to his family, and she's still close with them. The author is uncomfortable with this and refuses, even though she argues the ex was more of a friend now and wasn't with her when he died.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about feeling uncomfortable naming his son after a man his mom loved before him. He might feel it's a step towards the ex being seen as part of the child's identity, which he's not okay with. He might also worry about the son's feelings later in life, wondering why he's named after another man. It's personal and emotional for him.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend wants to honor her ex's memory, especially since he's part of her family now. She might feel that this is important to her and her family, and she's maintaining a connection. She points out that they weren't together when the ex died, so maybe she sees it more as a friendship than a romantic relationship. She's arguing that it's just honoring a friend, not the ex romantically.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, naming a child is a big decision, and both people in the relationship should have a say. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable and to express that. However, the girlfriend also has her reasons. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. If he's refusing without considering her feelings, maybe he's in the wrong. But if she's pushing for something that makes him really uncomfortable, maybe she's overstepping.\n\nThe author is not being aggressive, he's just stating his feelings. He's not trying to force her to change her mind, but he's also not willing to compromise. The girlfriend is asking for something that's important to her and her family. The issue is whether honoring a deceased person's name in this way is a reasonable request, especially when the person is not a parent.\n\nIn many cultures, naming a child after a deceased relative is common. If the ex is family now (since she's close to his family), maybe it's seen as a way to keep the memory alive. The author's discomfort might be valid, but he's also not the one who has to live with the son's middle name. However, the son might grow up wondering about the name's significance, but that's a future concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's refusing out of fear or insecurity, maybe. But if he's standing his ground because he doesn't want his son to have a name connected to someone else, that's his right. However, the girlfriend's reasons are also valid. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. Since both sides have valid points, but the author is not being combative and is just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But he might need to find a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer could be \"B\" (not in the wrong) because he's allowed to have his feelings and the decision requires mutual agreement.\n"
