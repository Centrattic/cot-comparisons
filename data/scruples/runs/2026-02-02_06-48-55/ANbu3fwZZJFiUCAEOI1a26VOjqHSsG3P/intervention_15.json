The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The situation is that the girlfriend wants the middle name of her deceased ex, and the author is uncomfortable with it. The ex died, and the girlfriend still has a close relationship with his family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's main issue is that he feels it's uncomfortable to have his son named after someone the mother loved before him. He doesn't want to explain that to people, including his son. On the other hand, the girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend who died, and they weren't together when he passed away. She wants to honor his memory and her family's feelings.\n\nIn terms of naming rights, I think both parents should have a say in their child's name. The author is standing his ground on a personal discomfort, which is valid. However, the girlfriend's desire to honor her friend and his family is also a significant consideration. The ex's death adds another layer because it's not just about a living person but also about their family's wishes.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for refusing. If I were to say he's in the wrong (A), it might be because he's dismissing her emotional connection and her family's wishes. But if the answer is B, it's because he's within his rights to feel uncomfortable and not want to proceed with the name. \n\nI think the key points here are mutual respect and compromise. But given that the author is clear in his stance and the girlfriend is pushing for it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, refusing to consider any compromise could be seen as being rigid. The situation is nuanced, but the author's feelings are legitimate. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because he's standing up for his own feelings, even though he should also try to understand her perspective.\n"
