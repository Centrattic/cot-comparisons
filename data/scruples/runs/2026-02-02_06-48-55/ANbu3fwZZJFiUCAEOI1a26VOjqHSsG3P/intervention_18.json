The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author's girlfriend wants the middle name to honor the ex, who was a friend before they were together. The author feels uncomfortable because it might imply the ex was a romantic partner, even though the ex passed away and they weren't together at the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants to honor her friend and his family, which shows she values her relationships with them. The author, on the other hand, feels that naming their son after someone else could be confusing or hurtful, especially if the son grows up knowing the middle name is from a previous relationship. \n\nThe key points here are the reasons behind the name choice and the author's feelings. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of death. She mentions still being close with the family, which might be important for her to maintain those connections. However, the author's discomfort is valid because names are significant and can carry connotations. Even if the ex was a friend, the middle name might raise questions or feelings of insecurity for the author and the son.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable about potentially honoring someone else in such a personal way. The girlfriend's request, while understandable, might not consider the author's emotional boundaries. It's possible that they could find a middle ground, like choosing a different name that honors the family without using the ex's name, or discussing openly with the son's future about the name's significance. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intent is to honor a deceased friend and maintain family ties. If the ex was a friend and not a romantic partner at the time of death, maybe the author's concern is about perception more than reality. However, names can carry weight, and the author's feelings are legitimate. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries here. They have the right to be uncomfortable about naming their child after someone else, especially if it could lead to complications. The girlfriend might need to reconsider the request if it's causing significant distress. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They are justified in their feelings and right to decline the name.\n"
