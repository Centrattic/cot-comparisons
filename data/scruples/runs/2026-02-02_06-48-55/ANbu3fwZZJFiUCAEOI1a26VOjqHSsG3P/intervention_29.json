      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple expecting a child, and the girlfriend wants the son's middle name to be after her ex, who has died. The author is uncomfortable with this and refuses, feeling it's weird to name their son after someone the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was just a friend when he died and that the family still wants to honor him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's main issue is emotional discomfort about naming their child after someone else the mother was in a relationship with. It's natural to feel that way because naming a child after an ex, even deceased, can feel like a step into the past that might complicate the current relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend's side is about honoring a loved one's memory and the family's wishes. She also mentions they weren't together when he died, so maybe the connection is more about friendship now. \n\nBut the author is the father here. Naming a child is a joint decision, and both parents should have a say. The girlfriend's request might be respectful to her family, but the author's feelings shouldn't be dismissed. However, the key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The ex is deceased, and the name is a middle name, which is a common practice to honor others. But the author's discomfort is valid because it's about the emotional aspect of the child's identity. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that she can reframe it as a friend might not fully address the author's concerns. If the author feels this could cause future issues, especially if the son grows up and learns about the ex's history, it's a legitimate concern. The author is standing his ground, which is his right. The girlfriend's ex is in the past, and while honoring him is important, the father's feelings about the child's naming should also be respected. \n\nIn many cultures, it's common to name children after deceased relatives. However, naming after an ex who wasn't in the current spouse's life might be more contentious. The author's refusal isn't about not honoring the dead but about personal boundaries in a new family. I think the author isn't in the wrong here because naming a child is a significant decision and both partners need to agree. The girlfriend's desire is valid, but the author's objection is also valid. Since he's standing up for his feelings, he's not the asshole. So the answer would be B.\n"
