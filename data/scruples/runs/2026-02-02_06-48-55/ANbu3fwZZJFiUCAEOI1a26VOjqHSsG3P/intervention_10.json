The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex. The girlfriend wants the middle name of her deceased ex, who she's still close with, for their son. The author is uncomfortable with it and says no, feeling it's weird to have the son be partly named after someone the mom loved before him. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of his death.\n\nHmm. Well, naming a child is a big decision and usually involves personal preferences and values. The author's discomfort is understandable. They might feel that having another man's name associated with their child, especially someone the mother had a past relationship with, could lead to questions or confusion later. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's honoring a friend and making her family happy, which is also valid. She's still close to the ex's family, so this might be important for her emotionally.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they have every right to express their feelings about naming their child. It's their child too, so they should have a say. The girlfriend's request is significant, but the author's objection is about their own feelings and what they're comfortable with. There's no obligation to honor someone else's name if it makes them uncomfortable. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel her needs are being dismissed. Maybe they need to find a compromise. But legally and ethically, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to do it. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
