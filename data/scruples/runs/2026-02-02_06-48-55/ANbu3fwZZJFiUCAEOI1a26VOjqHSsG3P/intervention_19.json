The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex, who died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend wants the middle name to be her ex because it's important to his family, and she's still close to them. She argues that since the ex died before they were together, it's just a friend now. The author is uncomfortable because it feels like the son is named after someone the mother loved before him. He refuses and says it makes him feel bad.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong for refusing. Let's break it down. Naming a child is a significant decision for both parents. The author has the right to his feelings here. If the ex is deceased, maybe the girlfriend wants to honor him for family reasons, which could be valid. But the author feels it's inappropriate because of the emotional weight of a past relationship. \n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the girlfriend could honor the ex in another way, like a memorial or a different name choice. But the core issue is about the author's discomfort. The girlfriend is pushing for something that makes him feel like the son is partially named after another man. That's a valid emotional response. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is advocating for honoring someone from her past, which might be important for her family's closure. If the ex was a significant person in her life, even if not together when he died, she might feel it's important. But the author's right to his feelings in this situation is also valid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't wrong to feel uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend's desire to honor her ex is also understandable. Whether the author is \"in the wrong\" for saying no depends on the cultural context and the relationship dynamics. However, in many cases, the parents should have mutual agreement on a child's name. Since the author is clearly against it, it's his right to refuse. The girlfriend might need to find another way to honor her ex without using the child's name. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. His feelings are valid, and he's justified in not wanting to proceed with that name.\n"
