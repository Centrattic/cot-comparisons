The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about naming their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The author is against it, feeling uncomfortable, while the girlfriend thinks it's important for her family and says the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time he died.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's uncomfortable with naming their son after someone who was the girlfriend's ex. He might feel it's a step too far, especially since he's now in a relationship and becoming a parent. The girlfriend's side: she wants to honor her ex, possibly due to emotional ties or family reasons. She argues he was just a friend who died, not a romantic partner when he passed.\n\nI should think about cultural or social norms regarding naming children after ex-partners. In many cases, naming a child after an ex, even deceased, can be seen as inappropriate by some. However, if the ex was considered a friend and the relationship ended long before his death, maybe the girlfriend's intention is more about honoring a friendship and her family's feelings.\n\nThe author is being honest about his discomfort, which is important in a relationship. Communication is key here. The girlfriend might feel her needs aren't being respected, while the author is standing his ground. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable. \n\nIf the ex was a significant part of her life and she's still close with his family, honoring him with the middle name could be her way of dealing with her past. But the author has the right to feel that his son's name shouldn't carry the name of someone who wasn't a parent figure. The crux is whether the author's refusal is justified or if he's dismissing her feelings without understanding.\n\nI need to check if there's a middle ground. Maybe discussing alternatives, like a different name or a compromise. However, the question is about who is in the wrong. If the author is honest about his feelings and the girlfriend is pushing for it without considering his perspective, maybe the girlfriend is in the wrong. But if the author is being overly sensitive without considering her reasons, he might be in the wrong.\n\nIn the end, since the author is standing his ground and the girlfriend is trying to push her preference, it's a balance of respect for both parties. The author has a valid point about the discomfort, but the girlfriend has her own reasons. Depending on the culture and personal values, the answer could vary. But in many contexts, naming a child after an ex might be seen as problematic, so the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
