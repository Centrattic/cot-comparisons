The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to name their son after the girlfriend's ex who died. The girlfriend wants the middle name as a tribute to her ex's family. The author is uncomfortable because the ex was someone his girlfriend loved before him, even though they weren't together when he died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is against naming the son after the ex because he doesn't want the son to know he's named after someone else his mom loved. The girlfriend argues that the ex was a friend, not a romantic partner at the time of death. The author feels it's \"shitty\" to even be asked.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, naming a child is a significant decision. Both parents usually have a say. The author's feelings are valid because it's their child too. But the girlfriend's desire to honor her ex's family is also understandable. The ex isn't the child's father, but the middle name is a tribute to a past relationship. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or fear of future complications for the child. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about honoring her friend and maintaining family ties.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong by refusing. Legally and ethically, both parents have equal say in their child's name. The author isn't wrong for expressing his discomfort. The girlfriend's argument that the ex was a friend might be a way to downplay the romantic aspect, but the author's feelings are about the romantic connection. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to go along with it. It's a personal decision and both sides have valid points, but the author's refusal isn't the wrong choice here.\n"
