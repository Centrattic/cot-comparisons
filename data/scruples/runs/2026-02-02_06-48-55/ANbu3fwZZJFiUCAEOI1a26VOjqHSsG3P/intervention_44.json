The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with.\n\nI said that makes me really uncomfortable and don't want to do it. I don't want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mom loved before me. She said, \"why can't you say he is named after my friend who died? We weren't even together when he died\". I continued saying no to the name and that it feels pretty shitty to even be asked to name him that. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to name his son after the girlfriend's ex, who has died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend wants the middle name of her ex because it's important to his family, and she's still close to them. She argues that they weren't together when he died and that he was just a friend. The author feels uncomfortable because it makes him feel like his son is partly named after someone else his mom loved before him. He doesn't want to tell people or his son that.\n\nNow, thinking about naming a child. Parents typically have a say in their child's name, and it's a significant decision. The author is uncomfortable with it, which is a valid feeling. But the girlfriend is advocating for her own reasons, which are also important to her. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to refuse? Well, the name is a personal choice, and both parents should have a say. The girlfriend's argument is that the ex was a friend, but the author feels it's about someone she loved before him. That could be a point of contention. \n\nLegally, both parents usually have to agree on the child's name. Emotionally, the author's discomfort is understandable. But the girlfriend's desire to honor her friend's family might also be important. \n\nI need to consider if there's a compromise. Maybe they could find another way to honor the friend without using the name. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If he's being reasonable and standing his ground on something that's important to him, maybe not. But if he's dismissing her feelings without considering alternatives, then maybe he is. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. If the author is firm without being dismissive, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's not open to discussion, perhaps he is. The story doesn't mention if they tried to find a middle ground. \n\nIn the end, naming is a personal decision. The author's feelings are valid, but so are the girlfriend's. If he's not willing to compromise, but the girlfriend insists, there's a conflict. The AITA question hinges on whose feelings are more important. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his own feelings about the name. It's a joint decision, and he's not dismissing her reasons entirely but stating his discomfort. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
