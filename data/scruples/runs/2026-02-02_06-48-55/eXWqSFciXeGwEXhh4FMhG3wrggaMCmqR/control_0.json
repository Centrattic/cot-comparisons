  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for installing a lock on my bedroom door, and keeping it locked when I'm not there?\nMy wife has a nasty habit of biting her nails. And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is between a husband and wife. The husband is upset because his wife doesn't wash her hands after biting her nails and then puts her hands into his cheese. He tried various solutions like labeling bags, getting a mini fridge, but she still ends up taking his cheese. Then he locks his bedroom door. The wife is upset, but he thinks he's justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The husband wants his cheese to be clean and uncontaminated by his wife's unwashed hands. He's taken steps to prevent this, including physical barriers. The question is whether he's overstepping.\n\nSo, the options are A (he's in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Let me break it down.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He's concerned about hygiene. His wife's actions are causing him discomfort. He's tried multiple solutions, but the problem persists. Locking the door is his final measure to protect his personal space and belongings. He's not denying her cheese, just his own.\n\nThe wife's perspective: She's being accused of taking his cheese but maybe doesn't see the issue. Her argument about kissing implies she doesn't see the problem with saliva transfer, but the husband is concerned about germs. They might have different views on what's acceptable.\n\nNow, considering societal norms. In a marriage, sharing living spaces and resources is common. However, personal boundaries can vary. The husband's actions might be seen as excessive if the wife isn't aware of the labels or if she's not intentionally taking them. On the other hand, if the husband has communicated clearly and the wife still ignores his requests, he's within his rights to protect his belongings.\n\nThe key points: The husband's actions are to protect his personal hygiene. He's not cutting off his wife from cheese entirely. The lock is a personal space issue. The wife might feel disrespected if the husband locks her out of his room, but they have separate bedrooms, so maybe that's acceptable.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the husband could communicate better or the wife could be more careful. But the husband has tried multiple solutions. The lock might be the only way he sees to ensure his cheese stays clean.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband's actions are a reaction to his wife's habits that he finds unhygienic. Unless there's a violation of a specific agreement, he's acting to protect his own preferences. While some might find the lock extreme, others might see it as necessary. The wife's reaction might indicate she doesn't understand his perspective, but that doesn't make him wrong.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). He's taking reasonable steps to maintain his hygiene standards in their shared living situation, especially since they have separate bedrooms. The lock is a personal choice to protect his belongings without harming the wife's access to her own cheese.\n"
