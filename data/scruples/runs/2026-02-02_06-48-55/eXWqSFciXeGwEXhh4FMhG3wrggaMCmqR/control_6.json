And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese. He's installed a lock on his bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his mini fridge where his cheese is stored. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then puts her fingers into his cheese right after her mouth. He finds this gross and wants his cheese to be clean. He buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she ignores the labels. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still takes his cheese. So he locks his room. \n\nThe main issue here is about boundaries and personal space. They have separate bedrooms, so maybe he's within his rights to have his room locked. He's not hiding something illegal or harmful; it's about personal hygiene preferences. The wife is upset, but he's justified because of his health/sanitation concerns. \n\nBut maybe there's a communication problem. Did he talk to her about his feelings before taking the extreme step of locking his door? If he didn't, that could be a problem. However, the story says he tried labeling and even gave her her own cheese, but she didn't respect that. So he escalated to a mini fridge and then a lock. \n\nIs locking his own bedroom door unreasonable? If they have separate bedrooms, then yes. It's his space; he can lock it. The fact that she's entering his room without permission is the bigger issue. But maybe the wife feels it's okay because they're married? Still, if she's intruding without asking, that's crossing a boundary.\n\nThe author's main argument is about food safety. He doesn't want to consume something that's been contaminated by her unwashed hands after biting nails. That's a valid health concern. Even though they kiss, which involves sharing saliva, that doesn't mean he's okay with her hands in his food. \n\nSo, the wife is violating his personal space and his food. The author is trying to protect his belongings and his hygiene. Installing a lock is a response to prevent further intrusion. Unless there's something else, like the wife has a legitimate reason to be in his room, but the story doesn't mention that. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He's defending his personal boundaries and health. The answer should be B.\n"
