And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. The situation involves a shared fridge, the wife taking the husband's cheese after using her unwashed hands post-nail-biting, leading to the husband's solution of a mini fridge in his room. Then the wife takes the cheese from his room, prompting the lock.\n\nFirst, the husband's concern about hygiene is valid. He doesn't want his food contaminated by someone else's germs. Using a mini fridge in his bedroom was a step to isolate his food. When the wife accesses it anyway, he locks the door. The key issue is ownership and boundaries in a shared household.\n\nIn many relationships, especially married ones, there's an expectation of sharing and mutual respect. However, individual preferences and boundaries can vary. The husband is trying to protect his personal space and preferences, which is understandable. But locking the bedroom door might be seen as overreacting, especially since they have separate bedrooms. The wife might feel that his actions are unnecessary or exclusionary.\n\nThe wife's argument is that they kiss, implying she doesn't see the issue with germs. However, the husband's stance is about personal hygiene preferences. The core conflict is about differing standards of cleanliness and how to address them without infringing on each other's space.\n\nThe husband's solution of a mini fridge was a reasonable step. But adding a lock might be crossing into territory where the wife feels her actions are being controlled. It's possible that communication could have resolved this earlier. However, the husband's actions are primarily to protect his own preferences, not to harm the wife. Since they have separate bedrooms, the lock might be a way to maintain personal space without affecting others. \n\nConsidering all that, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's asserting his right to personal space and hygiene preferences. The wife's actions have led to the need for such measures. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
