And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese. The main issue is about personal boundaries and shared living spaces.\n\nFirst, the wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which the author finds unhygienic. The author likes to eat shredded cheese and buys separate bags, labeled, but the wife ends up using the labeled one. Then the author gets a mini fridge, but the wife still accesses the cheese. Finally, the author locks the bedroom door to prevent this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. From a personal hygiene standpoint, the author's concern is valid. They want their food to be clean, especially considering the wife's habits. However, in a shared living situation, locking the bedroom door might be seen as creating a physical barrier that's more restrictive. The wife might feel disrespected or that her partner is being unnecessarily controlling. \n\nBut the key points are that the author isn't restricting the wife's access to food entirely\u2014she still has her own cheese. The lock is just to protect the author's personal food from contamination. The wife's actions are contributing to the problem by not respecting the labels and accessing the mini fridge. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to maintain personal hygiene standards. While the lock might seem extreme, it's a solution they came up with after previous attempts failed. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering misses the point about food safety. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a response to their own hygiene concerns and the wife's repeated disregard for their system. The lock is a personal choice to protect their own food, not to prevent the wife from eating. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
