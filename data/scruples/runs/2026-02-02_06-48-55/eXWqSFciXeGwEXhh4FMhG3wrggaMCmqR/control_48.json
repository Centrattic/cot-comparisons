And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese. The situation involves the wife's habit of biting her nails and not keeping her hands clean, which the author finds disgusting, especially when she puts her hands into his cheese after touching her mouth. The author tried several steps: labeling the cheese, getting a mini fridge, but eventually locked the door. The wife is upset, but the author stands by their decision for sanitation reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is about personal boundaries and food safety. The author feels their health and food hygiene is compromised. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being overly controlling or distrustful. \n\nIn a relationship, mutual respect and communication are important. The author tried to address the problem step by step, starting with labeling the cheese, then getting a mini fridge. However, when the wife continued to access his cheese, locking the bedroom door seems like a measure to protect his personal space and food. \n\nBut, the wife has access to her own cheese, so it's not about scarcity. The author's main concern is about germs and cleanliness, which is understandable. However, in a shared home, there might be expectations of shared spaces. Having separate bedrooms already suggests some level of separation, but locking the door could be seen as creating an unnecessary barrier. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are reasonable. From a food safety perspective, preventing contamination is valid. However, the social aspect\u2014locking the wife out of the bedroom when they aren't home\u2014might be seen as excessive. It could be interpreted as a lack of trust or creating distance in the relationship. \n\nIn many cultures, sharing a home involves some compromises. While the author has the right to protect their own food, the method chosen (locking the bedroom) might be seen as an overreaction. The wife's argument about kissing not being a problem contrasts with the author's specific issue with the cheese handling. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they have a legitimate health concern. However, the solution might be seen as extreme. The answer might hinge on whether the action taken is proportionate to the problem. Locking a bedroom door could be justified if there's a serious health issue, but in this case, it's about personal preference. \n\nSo, the author's actions are based on a reasonable desire for cleanliness, but the method of locking the door might be seen as too harsh. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance where the approach might be too extreme, leading to potential relational issues. However, given the options, the answer is likely B, as the author's intent is to protect their own food, which is their right.\n"
