And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe author is married and has a problem with his wife's nail-biting and not washing her hands. He likes to eat shredded cheese as a snack. The issue is that his wife takes his cheese from the fridge, uses her unwashed hands (right after biting her nails) to grab the cheese, which he finds disgusting. He started buying separate bags and labeling them. But she ended up taking his labeled bag, ignoring the labels. Then he bought a mini fridge for his bedroom, but she still came into his room and ate his cheese. So he locked his door. Now the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe wife's argument is that they kiss all the time, so it shouldn't matter. The author's stance is about food safety and not wanting someone else's saliva on his food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and mutual respect. The wife is entering his private space (bedroom) without his consent after he explicitly set up measures (mini fridge and then a lock) to prevent her access. Even if they share a home, having separate bedrooms doesn't automatically mean she has the right to enter his room. Locking the bedroom door is a reasonable way to enforce personal space and privacy.\n\nHowever, the author's behavior might be seen as overreacting if the wife didn't know that the cheese was off-limits. But in this case, the author took steps to separate his cheese, which was ignored. Then, after she accessed his room to take the cheese, he locked the door. If the wife was unaware of the need to respect his private space, maybe there was a lack of communication. But the author did take measures that should have been clear.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions are the initial problem. She's contaminating his food, which is a valid concern. The author has a right to expect that his food remains uncontaminated by others' hands, especially when they have known hygiene issues. The response of locking the door is a way to protect his personal items and space. While it's extreme, it's a response to repeated violations.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect. If the wife is entering his room without permission after he's set boundaries, that's a problem. But the author might have a point in needing to protect his personal space. However, the way he's handling it might be seen as isolating or not addressing the core issue. Maybe he should talk to her about the hygiene issue instead of just locking himself in.\n\nBut given the information, the author's actions are a direct response to his wife's repeated disregard for his preferences. He's taking steps to protect his belongings and personal space. So, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. He's protecting his own space and health concerns, even if the solution seems extreme.\n"
