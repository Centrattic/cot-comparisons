And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who's upset because his wife is using his cheese without washing her hands after biting her nails. He's taken steps to label the cheese, bought a mini fridge, and even locked his bedroom door to keep his cheese safe. His wife is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's main issue is hygiene. He's concerned about his wife's unwashed hands contaminating his food, specifically cheese. He's tried several solutions: labeling, separate fridge, and finally a lock. The wife argues that since they kiss, it shouldn't matter. The husband is asserting his need for food safety, while the wife feels it's an overreaction.\n\nNow, looking at the principles of right and wrong. Is the husband's action reasonable? He's trying to protect his health, so his motivation is valid. However, the method he uses\u2014locking his bedroom door\u2014might be seen as extreme. In a shared living space, especially in a marriage, privacy expectations can vary. If they have separate bedrooms, maybe a lock is less of an issue. But the wife might feel that the lock is a barrier to their relationship or a sign of distrust.\n\nThe wife's actions, putting unwashed hands into his cheese after biting nails, are indeed unsanitary. So her behavior is part of the problem. The husband's response is to physically block her access. But is there a middle ground? Maybe discussing the issue openly and finding a compromise, like ensuring hands are washed before handling food. The husband's solution of a lock might be effective but could create tension in the relationship, which is a social aspect to consider.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have some. The wife didn't respect his boundaries by taking his cheese, but the husband's response of locking the door might be too drastic. The question is whether the husband has the right to lock his room in a shared home. If they have separate bedrooms, the husband's room is his private space, so locking it is a reasonable privacy measure. But if they don't have separate bedrooms, it might be different. The scenario states they have separate bedrooms, so the lock is within his right.\n\nThe wife's argument about kissing is not valid because the issue isn't about sharing saliva through kissing but about hygiene when handling food. The husband's concern is legitimate. However, the lock might be an overreaction. Maybe there's a better way to communicate his needs without physical barriers. But given that he's tried other methods and the problem persists, the lock is a final step to protect his preferences.\n\nIn summary, the husband's actions are driven by a valid health concern, and the lock is a personal choice to protect his food. While the wife's actions are inconsiderate, the husband's solution is a boundary he's entitled to set in his own space. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
