And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife taking his cheese, even after he bought her her own. He took steps to keep his cheese safe by getting a mini fridge and then locking his room. The wife objects, but he's sticking to his position about food safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's main issue is about hygiene. He doesn't want his cheese contaminated by his wife's unwashed hands after she bites her nails. He's taken steps to prevent this, including providing her with her own cheese and then physically securing his room. On the other hand, the wife might feel that this is overreacting or that they should share, especially since they live together. \n\nThe question is whether his actions are justified. From a hygiene standpoint, he's trying to avoid health risks from contaminated food. It's his right to maintain personal safety standards. However, the method he used\u2014locking his door\u2014might be seen as an overreaction. But given that they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's reasonable. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing implies that they share germs otherwise, which is true, but food and kissing are different in terms of how germs spread. The husband's stance on food safety seems valid. \n\nConsidering his actions were to protect his own property and health, and he's not preventing her from accessing her own cheese, maybe he's justified. The labels were ignored, leading to the need for a mini fridge and then a lock. Since he's not violating any laws or obvious social norms by securing his personal space, the answer might be B. But some might argue that locking the bedroom door is excessive. However, given the context, it's his room, and he's using it to store his belongings. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
