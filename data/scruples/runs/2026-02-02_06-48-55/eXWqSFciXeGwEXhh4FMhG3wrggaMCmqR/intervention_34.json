And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who installed a lock on their bedroom door to prevent their wife from eating their cheese. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, and the author is really bothered by her putting her hands into the cheese after her mouth. \n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and shared responsibility in a relationship. The author mentions that they have separate bedrooms, which might mean they already have some separation. But the key issue is the cheese. The wife is taking the labeled cheese, leading the author to buy a mini fridge and then lock the door. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a legitimate concern about food hygiene. If someone with unwashed hands, especially after nail-biting, is putting their fingers into the cheese, that's a health issue. The author is trying to protect their own food from contamination. However, the solution they chose was to lock the bedroom door. That might be an overreaction, especially since the wife is a partner in the relationship. \n\nIn a shared living situation, there can be compromises. The author tried labeling, then a mini fridge, but when that failed, they resorted to locking the door. The wife's side of things isn't fully explained\u2014maybe she doesn't see the issue with her hygiene or doesn't understand why it's such a big deal. But the author's actions might be seen as extreme. Locking the bedroom door could be seen as cutting off shared space and possibly being controlling. \n\nEven though the author says it's not a money issue, the act of locking the door could lead to resentment. The wife might feel that the author is being unreasonable or not addressing the problem through communication rather than physical barriers. The author could have discussed their concerns more directly, maybe set clearer boundaries or found another solution that doesn't involve locking the door. \n\nThe author's reasoning about food safety is valid, but the method to enforce it might be too harsh. The wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the response of locking the door might be seen as the author's overreaction. So, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they took an extreme measure that affects their wife's access to a shared space, even if their initial concern is understandable.\n"
