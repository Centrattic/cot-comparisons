And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's wife takes his cheese after putting her unwashed hands in it after biting her nails. He buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she still takes his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still comes in and eats his cheese. So he locks his door. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal boundaries and food safety. The author has a legitimate concern about hygiene. He's not just being petty; he wants his cheese to be clean, free from germs. The wife isn't respecting his preferences even after he's made efforts to accommodate her by buying separate bags. The mini fridge was a step taken to maintain separation, but she still accesses it. \n\nThe author is protecting his own belongings and health. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the wife is entering his room and taking his food despite his attempts to prevent that, locking the door seems like a reasonable measure. \n\nHowever, some might argue that separate bedrooms are unusual for a married couple, but the question states they already have separate bedrooms. So the mini fridge in his room is his space. Locking it isn't about keeping her out entirely but protecting his personal items. \n\nThe wife's argument that they kiss all the time doesn't address his specific concern about the cheese. Kissing and sharing food can be different in terms of hygiene expectations. He's not against sharing; he just wants to know his cheese is his own. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are about maintaining personal space and hygiene. The answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe some would say communication failed, but he did take steps, and she didn't respect them. Locking the door is a final step after other measures failed. So yes, B makes sense.\n"
