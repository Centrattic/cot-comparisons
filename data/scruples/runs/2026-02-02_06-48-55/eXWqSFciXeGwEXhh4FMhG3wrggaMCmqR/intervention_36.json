And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese from being accessed by their wife. The situation involves the wife taking the husband's cheese after handling it in a way he finds unhygienic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's main issue is about hygiene. His wife's habit of nail-biting and not washing hands before handling his cheese is a concern for him. He tried several steps: buying her her own cheese, using a mini fridge in their separate bedroom, and finally locking the door. The wife, on the other hand, seems to not care as much about the hygiene aspect and might see the cheese as shared property in a marriage.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and boundaries. In a shared living space, especially in a marriage, there's an expectation of shared resources. But personal boundaries can vary. The husband is trying to protect his personal space and his food from what he perceives as contamination. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as excessive or a lack of trust, especially since they live together. The wife's reaction might be hurt or feeling excluded, even if the husband's intentions are about hygiene.\n\nLegally, if the husband paid for the cheese, he owns it. But socially, in a marriage, there's often an unspoken agreement to share food. The husband's actions could be seen as reasonable from a personal hygiene standpoint, but the method of locking the door might be where the issue lies. It's a matter of personal boundaries versus shared life. The husband's explanation about not wanting someone else's saliva on his food is a personal preference, but others might argue that in a committed relationship, some sacrifices are expected.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. From a hygiene perspective, he's protecting his own health, but the solution of locking the door might be seen as overstepping. The wife might feel that the husband isn't respecting their shared life by keeping things so separate. However, if the wife is not respecting his boundaries by taking his cheese despite his efforts, maybe the husband isn't wrong in trying to enforce them. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal values. But generally, in shared living, some compromise is expected. The husband's solution might be too extreme, leading to AITA (Am I the Asshole) status. So I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because his actions are to protect his hygiene and his stuff, but others might see it as A (in the wrong) for locking the door. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
