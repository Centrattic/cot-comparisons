And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, the situation: the wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. The husband likes to eat shredded cheese, but she uses her unwashed hands after biting her nails to take his cheese. He buys separate bags and labels them, but she ends up taking his. So he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still accesses it. Finally, he locks the door.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband has a valid concern about hygiene. His desire for his food to be clean is reasonable. The wife's actions are indeed unhygienic, especially since he's concerned about germs. He tried multiple solutions like buying separate bags and a mini fridge, but she still took his cheese. Locking the door seems like a last resort to protect his personal space and belongings.\n\nOn the other hand, they are married, which implies a level of shared living. If they have separate bedrooms, maybe there's an existing level of separation. But the wife might feel that the husband is overreacting or being possessive. However, the husband's actions are framed around health and safety, which is a legitimate concern. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering might be dismissive of his specific discomfort with germs on his food.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's right to personal hygiene and his attempts to resolve the issue without conflict. Locking the door is a way to prevent contamination, not to exclude her from the room otherwise. The wife has her own cheese, so it's not about scarcity. The husband's main issue is control over his own food's cleanliness.\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong here. His actions are a reasonable response to protect his health preferences, especially after multiple attempts to resolve the issue failed. The wife's behavior is the root cause, not the husband's solution. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
