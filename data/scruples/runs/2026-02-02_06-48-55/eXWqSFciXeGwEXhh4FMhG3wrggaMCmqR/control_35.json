And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's actions. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands. She uses the husband's cheese without washing her hands after her mouth, which he finds gross. He labels the cheese, but she still ends up taking his. He buys a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she accesses it anyway. So he locks the door.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The husband's main issue is food safety and hygiene. He's not against her eating cheese; he just wants his own to be untouched by her unwashed hands. He's taken steps to separate their food, but she's not respecting the boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he owns the cheese, so he's not wrong to protect his property. But in terms of relationship dynamics, maybe there's a different angle. The wife might feel that since they're married, they should share food, and locking the bedroom door could be seen as cutting her off. However, the husband's actions are to maintain his personal hygiene standards, which are valid.\n\nThe wife's actions are the root problem here. She's repeatedly taken his cheese despite his attempts to prevent it. The husband's solution is a personal choice to protect his preferences. Unless there's a cultural or social norm that I'm missing where couples must share all food without restrictions, the husband's actions are reasonable. \n\nSo, he's not in the wrong because he's defending his personal space and hygiene. The answer is B.\n"
