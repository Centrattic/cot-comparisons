And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's issue is with their wife putting unwashed hands into their cheese after biting her nails. They tried labeling the cheese, then a mini fridge, but she still took the wrong one. The final step was locking the bedroom door. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they are asserting their right to personal space and hygiene. They want their food to be clean and uncontaminated. The wife's actions are seen as a violation of that personal boundary. The author is trying to protect their own food without preventing the wife from having her own, just keeping their own separate.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not trusting. Installing a lock could be seen as an extreme measure, especially since they live together. The wife might argue that shared living spaces require some compromise and that the author's actions are unnecessary given their marital relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is based on hygiene concerns, which are valid. They've tried multiple solutions without success. The lock is a last resort to maintain their personal space. Since the author is not denying the wife access to her own cheese, just their own, the primary issue is about personal boundaries and health preferences.\n\nIn many relationships, it's common to have personal items kept separate. The use of a lock here is a way to enforce that separation. Unless there's a broader pattern of controlling behavior, this specific action seems reasonable. The wife's reaction might indicate a need for communication about boundaries, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to protect their own food preferences and hygiene.\n\nSo, considering the context, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
