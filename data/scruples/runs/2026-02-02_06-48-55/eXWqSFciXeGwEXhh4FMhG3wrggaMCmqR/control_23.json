And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is married, and their wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands. He snacks on shredded cheese, and she's been using his cheese after touching her mouth, which he finds gross. He tried labeling the cheese bags, but she didn't check the labels and ended up with his. Then he bought a mini fridge for his bedroom, but she still went into his room to eat his cheese. So he locked his room to prevent that. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and hygiene. The author is trying to protect his food from what he perceives as contamination. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that since they're married and they kiss, the germs shouldn't be a big deal. But the author is very particular about this.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions seem reasonable for someone who's concerned about hygiene. He tried several solutions: buying separate cheese, labeling, then a mini fridge, and finally locking the door. But the wife is clearly upset. In a shared living space, having a locked bedroom might be seen as creating unnecessary barriers. However, the author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful; it's about personal preference.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not entirely. He's protecting his personal space and preferences. But the wife's perspective is also valid. Maybe communication is the issue here. The author might have explained his feelings more clearly instead of locking the door. However, the action of locking the bedroom isn't inherently wrong if it's for personal comfort and hygiene. So the answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong. But I should check if there's any cultural or social norm that makes locking the bedroom door inappropriate. In some relationships, it might be seen as a sign of mistrust, but in this context, it's more about personal space and cleanliness.\n"
