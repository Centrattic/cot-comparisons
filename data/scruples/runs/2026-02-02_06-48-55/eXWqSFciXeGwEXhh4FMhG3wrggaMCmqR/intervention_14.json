And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door after his wife's habit of contaminating his cheese.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the cheese. The husband is upset because his wife uses her unwashed hands, after biting her nails, to take cheese from his bag. He buys labeled bags and a mini fridge to keep his cheese separate. When she still accesses his cheese, he locks his bedroom door. The wife argues that they kiss, so it shouldn't matter, but he's concerned about germs.\n\nThe question is whether the husband's actions are justified. On one hand, personal hygiene and food safety are valid concerns. He's trying to protect his own food from what he perceives as contamination. On the other hand, the wife is also part of a shared household, and keeping a room locked might be seen as overreacting or being inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the husband isn't trying to exclude her from his space entirely, just to protect his specific food item. The wife's actions are the root cause here\u2014she's repeatedly accessing his food despite his efforts to prevent it. The husband's measures escalate from labeling to a mini fridge, then a lock. Locking the room could be seen as a reasonable step to prevent further intrusion, especially since they have separate bedrooms. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing is about intimacy, but the husband's concern is about food safety. Those are different issues. The husband's actions are about maintaining his own standards, not about money or access. The key is whether the lock is a reasonable response. Since the wife isn't respecting his boundaries despite previous attempts, locking the door might be seen as necessary. \n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
