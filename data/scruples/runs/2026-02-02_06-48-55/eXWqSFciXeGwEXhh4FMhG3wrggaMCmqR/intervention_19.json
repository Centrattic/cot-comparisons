And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habit of putting unwashed hands into it after biting nails.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wife takes the husband's cheese with unwashed hands right after biting her nails, which he finds disgusting. He buys separate cheese, labels them, but she still ends up with his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still takes it. So he locks his room. He's not against her eating cheese but wants his own to be uncontaminated. She argues that since they kiss, it shouldn't matter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The husband's actions are meant to protect his own food preferences and hygiene. He's not denying her food, just separating his own. The wife, however, is disregarding his efforts by taking his cheese, which he's clearly marked. The lock is a response to her continued interference.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband has a right to his own preferences. However, the act of locking the bedroom door might be seen as excessive or creating a barrier in their relationship. But considering the context, his actions are a culmination of her not respecting his boundaries. The wife's argument about kissing doesn't address his specific hygiene concerns.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often have different thresholds for cleanliness. The husband is within his right to set boundaries for his own comfort. The lock is a personal space issue. Since they have separate bedrooms, the lock doesn't affect her access to her own space. The problem arises from her not respecting his clear boundaries (labels, mini fridge). \n\nSo, the husband is trying to enforce his own boundaries after repeated issues. While the wife's actions are inconsiderate, the husband's response, while extreme, is a reaction to her not respecting his preferences. The key here is mutual respect. If both parties can't communicate and find a middle ground, but the husband's actions are a direct response to her ignoring his requests, then he's not in the wrong. The wife is the one who repeatedly violates his boundaries, leading him to take more drastic measures.\n"
