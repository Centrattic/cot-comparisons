And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door and keeping it locked to prevent their wife from taking their cheese.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. The author likes to eat shredded cheese, and the wife takes his cheese with her unwashed hands right after biting her nails. He buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she ends up taking his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still takes the cheese from there. So he locks his door. The wife is upset, but he argues it's about food safety and personal preference.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting their personal space and food preferences. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the measures are excessive and that they should compromise. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and find solutions that respect each other's needs. The author's actions are driven by a legitimate concern about hygiene and food safety, which is a personal preference. However, installing a lock might be seen as an overreaction. While it's understandable that he wants his cheese to be untouched, the response of locking the door could be perceived as creating a barrier in their shared living space. \n\nBut, considering that they have separate bedrooms, the mini fridge was already a step to separate their belongings. Locking the door might be a reasonable next step for him to protect his food. The wife's actions (taking his cheese despite labels and a separate fridge) might be seen as disregarding his boundaries, so his response of locking the door is a way to enforce his boundaries. \n\nOn the flip side, the wife might feel that the author isn't considering her needs or that he's being overly controlling. The argument about kissing not making a difference in food safety might be her way of saying that they share things, so individual food preferences shouldn't matter. But the author's point is that it's not about sharing, but about personal health and comfort.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong: If the wife is repeatedly ignoring his attempts to set boundaries (labels, separate fridge), then locking the door is a logical step to maintain those boundaries. However, the appropriateness might depend on cultural or personal expectations of shared living spaces. Some might see locking the bedroom door as creating unnecessary separation, while others see it as a necessary action to respect personal space.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to protect his personal preferences and health, and the wife isn't respecting his boundaries. The author's actions are a response to her not respecting those boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
