And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is about hygiene. Their wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then takes her fingers out of her mouth and into the cheese. The author finds this gross and wants their cheese to be clean. They tried labeling the cheese, which didn't work, then bought a mini fridge in their bedroom. The wife still accessed it, leading to the decision to lock the door. \n\nSo, the author's actions are driven by personal hygiene issues. They aren't trying to prevent the wife from eating cheese generally but to ensure their own is uncontaminated. The wife, however, might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not respecting shared space. Even though they have separate bedrooms, the mini fridge was in the author's room, and locking it could be seen as reasonable if the author is trying to protect their own belongings. \n\nThe author isn't denying the wife food entirely; they even mention buying her own cheese. The problem is about control over their own space and possessions. The wife's actions of ignoring labels and entering the room might have escalated the situation. Locking the door seems a logical step to prevent further issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might argue that they are in a relationship, and sharing resources is part of that. But the author's stance is about personal hygiene, which is a valid concern. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to solve a problem caused by the wife's habits. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a response to their own discomfort and attempts to address a recurring issue. While the wife might feel wronged, the author's right to protect their personal space and belongings is understandable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
