And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to determine if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese. He installed a lock on his bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his mini fridge where his cheese is stored. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue is the hygiene aspect. His wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses them to take cheese from his bag right after her mouth. He finds this gross and wants his cheese to be clean. He tried labeling and even getting a separate fridge, but she still took his cheese. Now he locks his room.\n\nOn the other side, the wife might feel that this is an overreaction. They live together, share a home, and the idea of separate belongings can be contentious. The husband's solution of a mini fridge in his room might be seen as creating separate living spaces too much, especially if they have separate bedrooms already. Locking the room could be perceived as being controlling or making it harder for her to access shared items.\n\nThe question is whether the husband's actions are justified. He's trying to protect his personal space and his food from what he sees as contamination. However, locking the door might infringe on the wife's access to the room they share. Even if they have separate bedrooms, the bed is a shared space. If she's sitting on his bed, eating his cheese, does he have the right to lock her out of his room entirely?\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he doesn't care about the cost; he just wants his cheese to be his. But by locking the room, he's preventing her from accessing his personal space, which might be beyond just about the cheese. It could be a boundary issue. The wife's perspective is that they kiss all the time, so why the cheese is different. She might not see the same hygiene issue he does.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might think the husband is being overly particular, while others would support his right to have control over his personal belongings and space. However, locking the door might be seen as an extreme measure. It's possible he could have found another solution, like using a more secure container for the cheese instead of locking the entire room. The fact that he's taking such a step could be seen as making it harder for her to access the room, which might not be fair, especially if the room is shared.\n\nSo, the key points are hygiene concerns vs. personal space boundaries. The husband's actions are to protect his personal hygiene, but the method could be considered excessive. The wife's actions might be seen as careless, but the husband's response (locking the door) might be more about control than just the cheese. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for taking such an extreme measure when the issue could be resolved with less intrusion into shared living space.\n"
