And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The main issue is about the author installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands properly. She takes his cheese from the fridge, uses her hands that were in her mouth, and then he gets upset. He buys her her own cheese bags, labels them, but she still ends up with his. So he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still goes in and eats his cheese there. Then he locks the door.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author is clearly frustrated because he wants his cheese to be safe from his wife's hands, which he finds unhygienic. He's taking steps to protect his personal food preferences. On the other hand, the wife might feel that sharing food is normal in a relationship, and the fact that he's locking the door could be seen as overreacting or being possessive. \n\nThe key points here are personal boundaries and shared responsibilities. In a marriage, there's often an expectation of sharing, but there's also the right to personal preferences. The author's issue isn't with the quantity of cheese but the hygiene aspect. He's not saying she can't eat cheese, just that his should be kept separate. \n\nHowever, installing a lock on the bedroom door might be seen as extreme. While it's his room, sharing a room is common in marriages, and locking it could create distance. The wife's reaction might be that she's not respecting his boundaries, but his actions might be seen as unnecessary. \n\nBut then, hygiene is a valid concern. If he's uncomfortable with her hands in his food, especially when they're not clean, that's a legitimate issue. The wife might not realize the extent of his concern. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the wife is being considerate and he's being overly controlling, maybe. But if hygiene is a genuine issue, he's protecting his health. The line between reasonable and over-the-top is blurry here. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's addressing a legitimate personal hygiene issue and taking steps to protect his own preferences. However, there might be a more diplomatic way to handle it rather than locking the door. But given the situation, he's within his rights to set boundaries regarding his own food.\n"
