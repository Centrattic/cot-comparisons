And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's issue is that their wife handles the cheese after biting her nails and not washing her hands. They clearly label the cheese, but she ignores the labels. So they get a mini fridge in their room, but she still comes in and eats it. Then they lock the door. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that they share a household, and maybe she sees the cheese as a shared resource. The author is prioritizing their personal space and hygiene, which is understandable. But locking the bedroom door might be an overreaction. \n\nIn a shared living situation, there's an expectation of mutual respect. If the author wanted to keep their cheese separate, maybe they could have communicated better. The wife might feel that the lock is unnecessary and a bit extreme, even if the cheese issue is valid. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't mind her eating cheese, just not their specific bag. But by locking the room, they're restricting access to their personal space, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, while the author's hygiene concerns are valid, the solution of locking the door might infringe on the wife's expectations of shared space. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for taking such a drastic measure. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
