And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is that their wife takes their cheese after using her hands in her mouth, which they find unsanitary. They tried labeling the cheese bags, then a mini fridge, but the wife still ended up with their cheese. So they locked the door to prevent access. \n\nOn the wife's side, she's not respecting the author's request to keep their cheese separate. Even with labels and a mini fridge, she didn't check and took the wrong one. The author's solution of a locked bedroom might be seen as extreme, especially since they live together. But the key here is about personal boundaries and health concerns.\n\nThe author is concerned about food safety and their own preferences. They mention not caring about the cost, just wanting their cheese to be theirs. The wife argues that they share saliva when kissing, so it shouldn't matter. But the issue is about hygiene and the author's comfort with the food they eat.\n\nIs locking the bedroom door a reasonable step? It might come off as overkill to some, but if the wife is repeatedly not respecting the author's wishes, maybe it's a necessary measure. The author isn't trying to cut the wife off from food, just their own portion. However, keeping a bedroom locked when not present might cause friction, especially if the wife needs access or feels excluded.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are justified. While the initial problem is valid (personal hygiene and food safety), the response of locking the bedroom door could be seen as taking it too far, especially if there's no prior discussion about the issue. Maybe the author should have communicated better or found a different solution. But considering the repeated failures of other methods, the lock might be their last resort to protect their personal space and belongings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions might be seen as a way to enforce personal boundaries. However, in a shared living space, locking a room entirely could be perceived as inconsiderate. The wife's actions are inconsiderate too, but the solution might not be the best approach. The answer might depend on whether the author's method is proportionate to the problem. Since the author isn't trying to prevent the wife from eating anything, just their own cheese, the lock might be a reasonable boundary despite seeming extreme.\n"
