And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about the author installing a lock on their bedroom door because their wife keeps taking their cheese. The wife's problem is that she bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then put her hands into the cheese. The author wants their cheese to be clean and safe, so they bought a mini fridge and locked their room.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points here. The wife's actions are causing the author discomfort because of hygiene issues. The author is trying to protect their personal space and food. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not communicating properly. \n\nThe author argues that it's a food safety issue, which is a legitimate concern. However, their solution is to lock the bedroom door. Now, separate bedrooms are common in some marriages, but using a lock might be seen as creating a barrier where there shouldn't be one. The wife might feel that the author is keeping secrets or being possessive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they clearly labeled the cheese bags, but the wife ignored the labels. So the author tried non-confrontational methods first. Then the mini fridge, which the wife still accessed. At that point, the author took the step of locking the room. \n\nBut is locking the room over cheese a reasonable response? It might come across as extreme. The wife's actions are considered rude, but the author's response might be seen as overreacting. The wife might not understand the severity of the hygiene issue. \n\nHowever, the author explains their deep concern about food safety, which is about health. If the wife isn't respecting boundaries despite clear communication, maybe the lock is a way to protect their health. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's solution might be creating more conflict. Instead of discussing the issue, they took a unilateral action. The wife's argument that they kiss all the time implies she doesn't see the same issue with saliva exchange, but that's different from food handling. \n\nSo, the author's actions are driven by personal health concerns, but their method of solving the problem might be problematic. The lock could be seen as a sign of mistrust or control. However, if the wife isn't respecting boundaries, maybe the author has a right to protect their space. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The author tried multiple steps before locking the room. The lock is a last resort to protect personal items. The wife's actions are indeed inconsiderate, but the author's solution might be excessive. However, the author's perspective is about health, so it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their health and personal space. But some might argue that the lock is too harsh. But given the wife's repeated disregard for the author's preferences, the lock could be justified.\n"
