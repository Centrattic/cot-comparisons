And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person installed a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese. The wife does this because she bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, and he's concerned about hygiene. He's bought her her own cheese, labeled them, but she ends up taking his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still goes in and takes his cheese. So he locks the door.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's trying to protect his personal stuff and his health. He's justified in wanting his food to be clean. On the other hand, installing a lock on the bedroom door might be seen as cutting off shared access. But wait, they have separate bedrooms? So maybe it's not about marital space but his personal belongings. However, if they're in a shared home, is it unreasonable for her to enter his bedroom? Maybe she's used to it since they live together. But he's making it clear that his cheese is off-limits. \n\nThe wife's actions are the trigger\u2014she's taking his cheese despite the labels and the mini fridge. So he's trying to enforce his own boundaries. He's not keeping her out of the entire house, just his room when he's not there. Is that overkill? Well, if they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's reasonable for him to want his space secure. The key issue is consent and mutual respect. Did he communicate his boundaries? The labels and fridge steps were attempts, and when those failed, the lock. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing is a bit dismissive. Just because they share saliva sometimes doesn't mean he's okay with her hands in his food. The health concern is valid. So maybe he's not in the wrong. The lock is a last resort after she ignored his efforts. So answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
