And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's upset because his wife is using his cheese after she bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands. He's taken steps to keep his cheese safe by getting a mini fridge in his bedroom and then installing a lock.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is about hygiene and food safety. He wants his cheese to be uncontaminated, which is a reasonable personal preference. On the other hand, the wife might feel that his actions are overreacting, especially since they live together and share a fridge. Installing a lock on the bedroom door could be seen as an extreme measure, but it depends on the context. They have separate bedrooms, so maybe that's normal. But sitting in his bed and eating his cheese without permission might trigger his decision to lock the door.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The husband didn't ask his wife if installing a lock was okay. He did it unilaterally. While his intentions are to protect his personal stuff, the method might be seen as infringing on her access or privacy. However, the fridge is in his room, so he owns that space. But the wife might argue that she's sharing a home and should be able to access shared spaces.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband tried labeling and getting a mini fridge, but maybe he should have talked to his wife first before locking the door. The wife's reaction (\"shouldn't matter\") shows a difference in perspective. The husband's need for hygiene is valid, but the solution's impact on their relationship is important. Locking the door might be seen as unnecessary if it's causing tension.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, protecting personal property is reasonable. On the other hand, the method might be excessive without discussing it with his wife. The answer hinges on whether the husband's actions were a reasonable boundary or an overreach. Since they're married, shared spaces are expected, but separate bedrooms can allow for personal space. The lock itself might not be wrong, but the lack of communication could be. However, the original question is about being in the wrong, not just the method. Given that the husband's intent is valid, and the lock is a personal choice in his own room, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that the lock is extreme. I think the answer depends on cultural norms and the couple's specific dynamics. Since the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I'm supposed to evaluate, I'll go with B (No, he's not in the wrong) because it's about personal hygiene and boundaries he's setting in his own space.\n"
