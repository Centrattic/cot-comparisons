And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author installed a lock on their bedroom door to prevent their wife from taking their cheese, which she does after biting her nails and without washing her hands. The author finds this behavior gross and wants their cheese to be clean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main concern is about hygiene and personal boundaries regarding their food. They've tried several steps to address the issue\u2014buying separate cheese, labeling, a mini fridge\u2014but the wife still takes their cheese. The final step was locking the bedroom door to keep it secure. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that since they are in a shared household, personal belongings like a mini fridge in a bedroom should be accessible when the other person is there. The wife's argument is that they kiss, so sharing germs shouldn't matter, but the author disagrees based on food safety.\n\nLegally, the author owns their own property and can lock their bedroom. However, in a marriage, expectations of shared living might mean that certain actions could be seen as overstepping. The key issue here is whether locking the bedroom is a reasonable response to a hygiene concern. \n\nThe author isn't at fault for wanting their food to be clean, but locking the door might be seen as isolating or not considering the wife's perspective. The wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not communicating the issue properly. The author could have tried more communication instead of resorting to locking the room. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have valid hygiene concerns, but the solution might be excessive and potentially hurtful in a marital context. However, the right to personal space and protecting personal items could justify the action. The answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. The author's actions are within their rights, but the approach might lack empathy. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. Given that the author is protecting their own belongings and health, they might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
