And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, let's read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole for installing a lock on their bedroom door and keeping it locked when they're not there. The problem started with the wife biting her nails and not washing her hands. The husband likes to eat shredded cheese, but his wife would take the bag from the fridge, put her unwashed hands (right after biting her nails) into his cheese. He finds this disgusting and starts buying her separate bags, labeling them. But she ignores the labels and takes his cheese again. Then he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still comes in to eat his cheese. So he locks the door. Now she's upset, saying they kiss all the time, so it shouldn't matter. The husband insists on food safety.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for taking these steps to protect his cheese.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and shared living situations. In a marriage, there's usually an expectation of shared space and certain compromises. However, everyone has different boundaries, especially regarding personal hygiene and food. The wife's actions are objectively unsanitary from the husband's perspective, which is a valid concern. Food safety is a legitimate issue here\u2014introducing unwashed, potentially contaminated hands into food can spread bacteria, even if the wife isn't ill.\n\nThe husband's attempts to solve the problem escalate from buying separate bags to a mini fridge and finally locking the door. Each step is a response to the previous failure. The first step, buying separate cheese, was a reasonable compromise, but the wife didn't respect the labels. The mini fridge was an attempt to physically separate the food, but she still accessed it. Locking the bedroom door seems like a more extreme measure, but it's to protect his personal items. \n\nHowever, in a shared living situation, completely locking oneself off might be seen as overreacting. The wife might feel that the husband is being unreasonable, especially since they share other aspects of their lives, like kissing. But the husband's stance is about food safety, which is a health concern. The wife's behavior is contributing to the problem, so the husband's response is about protecting his own health and preferences.\n\nAnother angle: in many relationships, partners respect each other's preferences, even if they don't share them. The husband's preference for clean, uncontaminated food is valid. If the wife can't respect that, then the husband has a right to take measures to protect his own space. However, the deadbolt might be seen as cutting off access to a shared space, which could be an issue if they need to access that room for other reasons. But the husband mentions they have separate bedrooms, so maybe the bedroom is considered his personal space, and locking it isn't unreasonable if they don't need to share it.\n\nThe wife's argument about kissing is a bit weak\u2014kissing is different from handling food. Saliva transfer in kissing is a different context than someone putting their hands into food after biting nails and not washing. The husband's concern is about germs on hands entering food, which is a valid hygiene issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's actions seem like a reasonable escalation to protect his own health and preferences. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries, so he's taking steps to enforce them. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
