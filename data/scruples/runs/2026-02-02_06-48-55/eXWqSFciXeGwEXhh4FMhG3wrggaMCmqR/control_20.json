And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. Hmm. So the main issue here is about boundaries and personal space, right?\n\nFirst, the author's wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which leads to her putting her hands into the author's cheese after her mouth. The author finds this gross and starts labeling cheese bags. The wife ignores the labels and takes the author's cheese. Then the author gets a mini fridge in their shared bedroom, but the wife still takes the cheese. Finally, the author locks the door to prevent this.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is trying to protect their personal space and food preferences. But they're in a shared living situation, so installing a lock might be seen as an overreaction by some. The wife is upset because she feels it's unnecessary, especially since they kiss, implying she doesn't see the issue. The author argues about hygiene and food safety.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, everyone has the right to their own preferences and boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with their food being touched in a certain way, they have the right to set those boundaries. On the other hand, in a shared home, creating a locked space might be seen as isolating or not considering the partner's feelings. The wife might feel disrespected or that the author isn't compromising.\n\nBut the author's actions seem to be about their own comfort and hygiene. They mentioned they don't care about the cost, just want their cheese untouched. The lock is a solution to protect their personal space. However, maybe there were other ways to handle this, like talking more openly with the wife, maybe finding a better storage solution that doesn't involve locking the door. But the author tried previous steps like separate fridges. The final step was locking the door, which might be seen as extreme but could be justified if all else failed.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. They're asserting their right to personal space and hygiene, but the method might be seen as harsh. But if all other options were exhausted and the wife wasn't respecting the boundaries, then the lock is a self-protective measure. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the situation is perceived. In many cases, people might say the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their own space, even if it's a shared home. So maybe answer B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
