And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who locked their bedroom door to prevent their wife from taking their cheese is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the husband has a legitimate issue with his wife handling his cheese in a way he finds unsanitary. He's tried several steps: buying her her own cheese, labeling them, then getting a mini fridge. When that didn't work, he locked his room. \n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The husband's actions stem from a desire for hygiene and control over his own food. However, installing a lock might be seen as an extreme measure, especially since they live together. While the wife's actions are inconsiderate, the husband's solution of locking the door could be perceived as overreacting or creating a barrier in their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband has a right to his personal space and preferences. If the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, his actions might be a necessary step to protect his health and peace of mind. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife isn't respecting his efforts to maintain hygiene, and the husband's actions are to protect his own health, it's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. The husband might have been better off discussing the issue rather than resorting to a lock. But given the situation, he's taken steps that others might see as reasonable for personal hygiene. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because he's protecting his own health and preferences, even if the method is extreme.\n"
