And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to prevent his wife from taking his cheese. \n\nFirst, the husband's main issue is his wife's habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which he finds unhygienic. He dislikes her putting her fingers into his cheese after her mouth, which he finds disgusting. He tried labeling cheese bags, giving her her own, and even getting a mini fridge in his bedroom. However, she still took his cheese, leading him to lock his room.\n\nThe key points to consider are boundaries in a marriage, shared household responsibilities, and the appropriateness of the solution. While the husband has a valid concern about hygiene and personal preferences, using a deadbolt to lock his bedroom might be seen as an extreme measure. In a marriage, there's an expectation of shared space and mutual respect. Locking the bedroom could be perceived as creating a barrier that wasn't there before, potentially affecting trust and openness.\n\nThe wife's actions, while unhygienic to the husband, might not be malicious. She might not realize the extent of his discomfort. The husband's solution, while practical for his needs, might come off as overreacting. Communication seems to be a missing element here. Instead of locking the door, discussing the issue and finding a compromise, like using separate storage without isolation, might have been a better approach.\n\nHowever, the husband isn't wrong in wanting to maintain his hygiene standards. The problem is more about how he addressed it. The question is whether the lock is an unreasonable reaction. Since they have separate bedrooms, a lock might be practical, but in a marital context, it could still be seen as excessive. The answer hinges on whether the husband's actions are proportionate to the issue. Given that he took steps to provide alternative solutions before locking the room, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the final measure of installing a deadbolt might be where the line is crossed, making him partially at fault.\n"
