And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who keeps his cheese in a mini fridge in his bedroom and installed a lock after his wife ate his cheese despite labels. The wife's habit of biting nails and not washing hands is a key point here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid concern about hygiene. If his wife is putting her unwashed hands into his cheese after biting her nails, that's unsanitary. He's trying to protect his food from germs. But the wife might feel that since they're married, sharing food is normal, and the husband's reaction is too extreme. \n\nThe husband's actions include buying separate cheese and a mini fridge, which seems reasonable. But when she still took his cheese, he locked the door. The question is whether locking the door is overstepping. In a shared home, does either spouse have the right to lock their bedroom? Generally, yes, because it's their private space. However, some might argue that in a marriage, there's an expectation of access to each other's rooms, especially if the reason for locking is to keep something away. \n\nBut the husband's reasoning is about food safety, which is health-related. He's not keeping something secret but trying to avoid contamination. The wife's actions are the cause of the problem, so the husband's solution might be justified. However, the wife might feel disrespected or that her partner's habits are being criticized, even if that's not the intention.\n\nThe key points are food safety, personal boundaries, and shared living arrangements. The husband is within his rights to lock his room, but whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on cultural or societal norms. Some might say he's being overly cautious, while others support his right to control his own space and health choices. Since the story is from his perspective and he's taking measures to protect his food, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a chance the community might think he's being too controlling. However, given the context of hygiene, it's more about personal health than control. So I think the answer is B.\n"
