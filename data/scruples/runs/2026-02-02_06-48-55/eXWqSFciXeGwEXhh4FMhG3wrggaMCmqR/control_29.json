And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's upset about his wife using his cheese in a way he finds unhygienic. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband has a separate bedroom. He keeps a mini fridge there with labeled cheese bags. The wife takes his cheese despite the labels and the fridge being separate. He then locks his room to prevent access. The question is whether he's overstepping.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is about hygiene. He doesn't want his food contaminated by his wife's unwashed hands after she bites her nails. That's a valid health concern for some people. On the other hand, the wife might feel that sharing a home includes sharing resources, and the husband's solution of locking his room might seem extreme. \n\nIs locking the bedroom a reasonable action? Since they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's his space to secure. But if they live in the same house, expecting complete privacy might be an issue. However, the husband's actions are to protect his personal preferences, not to exclude his wife unnecessarily. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing not being a problem might not address the specific issue of food contamination. The husband's need for cleanliness in his food isn't unreasonable. So, he's trying to respect her by buying her her own cheese but she's not respecting his labels. \n\nLocking the room is his way to enforce boundaries. If it's his room, he has the right to lock it. The problem might be if the wife felt her actions were harmless, but the husband's reaction is about his personal standards. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's taking steps to protect his own preferences without denying her access to her own cheese. The labels were ignored, so the lock is a logical next step. Therefore, answer B.\n"
