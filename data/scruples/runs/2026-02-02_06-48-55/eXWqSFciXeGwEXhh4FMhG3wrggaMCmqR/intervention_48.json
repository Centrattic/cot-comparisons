And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to prevent his wife from taking his cheese. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, which he finds disgusting. He buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she ends up taking his. He then gets a mini fridge and locks his room, which she still accesses. Now he's installed a deadbolt and keeps his room locked when he's not there. The wife says it shouldn't matter because they kiss, but he's concerned about germs and food safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband has a legitimate hygiene concern. Nail biting can introduce germs, and if he's concerned about cross-contamination, that's a valid health issue. He tried to solve the problem by buying separate cheese and a mini fridge, but the wife didn't respect the boundaries. The deadbolt is a more extreme measure, but is it reasonable?\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the wife is taking his cheese despite his efforts, maybe she isn't respecting his preferences. However, the husband's actions of locking the bedroom door might be seen as overreacting. Bedrooms are typically shared spaces, and locking it could be perceived as secrecy or lack of trust. But since they have separate bedrooms, maybe that's different. Wait, the scenario mentions they have separate bedrooms. So the husband's bedroom is his private space. If he's not in the same room, then locking it makes sense for him to protect his belongings and personal hygiene. \n\nBut the wife is entering his room and taking his cheese. Even if it's her home, entering someone's private room without permission might not be okay. So maybe the husband has the right to lock his room. However, some might argue that it's an unnecessary step, but given his specific concern, it's a solution he found to protect his food. The wife's argument about kissing is dismissive of his actual concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband could have communicated better. He might have discussed the issue with his wife instead of taking unilateral action. But he did try to label the cheese and buy a mini fridge. The wife's behavior is the root problem here. The husband's actions are about personal space and hygiene, which are his rights. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions, while perhaps extreme, are a reasonable response to his wife's repeated disregard for his preferences. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Some people might think that locking the bedroom door is too much, but given the context of separate bedrooms and his specific issue, it's a way to enforce his boundaries. His intent was to keep his food clean, not to harm the relationship. The wife's actions are the ones causing the problem. So I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
