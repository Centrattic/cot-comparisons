And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to prevent his wife from eating his cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is upset because his wife uses her unwashed hands, right after biting her nails, to take cheese from his fridge. He's concerned about hygiene and doesn't want her saliva or germs on his food. He's tried labeling the cheese bags, even bought a mini fridge, but she still ends up eating his cheese. So he locks his room to keep it safe.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that she's being excluded or that her partner isn't considering her needs. They share a home, so having separate fridge access might be seen as creating unnecessary boundaries. The husband's actions could come off as controlling or not trusting her, even though his primary concern is cleanliness.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are hygiene concerns versus shared living space norms. The husband has valid food safety issues, but his solution might be over the top. Installing a lock could be seen as an extreme measure, especially since they have separate bedrooms. However, if he's genuinely uncomfortable with the hygiene aspect, maybe it's reasonable. But there might be less confrontational ways to handle it, like talking to her again or finding another storage solution. \n\nThe wife's argument that they kiss all the time implies that she doesn't see the issue, but the husband's discomfort is about the specific context of handling food. It's a matter of personal boundaries. The husband's actions might be justified if the problem persists and he's tried other solutions. But the lock might infringe on the wife's access to shared space, even if they have separate rooms. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's actions are proportionate. He's taken several steps to protect his food, and the lock is a final measure. While his intention is to maintain hygiene, the method could be seen as excessive. However, if he's not causing financial strain and is providing her with her own cheese, maybe it's justified. Still, the installation of a lock might be an overreaction. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting his personal space and health. Hmm.\n"
