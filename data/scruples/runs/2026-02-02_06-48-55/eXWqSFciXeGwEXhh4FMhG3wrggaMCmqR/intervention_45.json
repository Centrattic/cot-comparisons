And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife eats his cheese without washing her hands after biting her nails. He's taken steps to buy her her own cheese, then a mini fridge, and now a lock on his bedroom door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband has a legitimate concern about hygiene. His wife's habit of biting her nails and not washing hands could introduce germs. He's trying to protect his food, which is understandable. But the measures he's taking\u2014like locking the bedroom door\u2014might be where the issue lies. \n\nIn a marriage, there's usually an expectation of shared space and resources. Having separate bedrooms is a bit unusual, but the user mentions that they do. However, installing a lock to prevent his wife from entering might be overstepping. Even if they have separate rooms, the act of locking the door when he's not there could be seen as excluding her completely from his personal space, which might not be necessary. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also part of the equation. She doesn't see the issue, given they kiss often. But personal boundaries can vary. The husband's actions are about his comfort with germs, which is his personal choice. However, locking the door might be an extreme solution that creates more tension than it solves. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's acting on his own needs, but the method of resolving the conflict might be problematic. Communication could have been a better approach. Maybe discussing the issue instead of using locks would be more constructive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer often depends on cultural and relational norms. Some might see his actions as reasonable self-care, while others might think he's being overly controlling. \n\nIn many cases, Reddit discussions like this often result in mixed opinions. But the key here is whether the husband's actions are justified. He's not harming her, just protecting his food. However, the lock might be a privacy or boundary issue. Since they're married, there's an expectation of shared life, and locking the door could be seen as creating unnecessary barriers. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is eating his food despite his efforts to separate it, he's within his rights to take stronger measures. The lock ensures his personal items are safe. But it could be argued that the problem isn't the cheese itself but the wife's behavior, which he hasn't addressed directly. Maybe he should confront her about washing hands rather than locking the door. \n\nIn summary, the husband's actions are a response to his hygiene concerns, but the method of using a lock might be seen as extreme. However, if he's not infringing on her rights and is just protecting his personal property, some might defend him. The answer hinges on whether the lock is an overreaction or a reasonable step. Given the context, it's possible he's not entirely in the wrong, but his approach could be improved. The final answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's acting to protect his own preferences, but there's room for discussion on the method.\n"
