And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to prevent his wife from taking his cheese. The wife takes his cheese after biting her nails and not washing her hands, which he finds gross. He buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she ignores the labels. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still takes his cheese. So he locks his door.\n\nHmm. I need to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue is about personal boundaries and shared living space. In a marriage, sharing space is normal, but so is respecting personal preferences. The husband has a strong aversion to his wife handling his food in a certain way. He's taken steps to separate their belongings, but she's not respecting that. Installing a lock might seem extreme, but maybe he's within his rights to protect his own property.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is in their shared home. Using a bedroom door as a lock might be seen as excluding her from a part of the house they both own. However, separate bedrooms aren't uncommon, and if they're in separate rooms, maybe it's more acceptable. The key points are consent and mutual respect. If the wife didn't agree to the lock, that could be an issue. But the husband's reasoning is about hygiene, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe not. The answer hinges on whether locking the bedroom door is an unreasonable action given the circumstances. If the husband is protecting his own belongings in his own room, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The wife's actions (ignoring labels, taking the cheese) might justify the husband's response. So maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural or social norm that makes the lock inappropriate. In some contexts, locking a spouse out might be seen as cold, but if it's about personal space and hygiene, it's more about individual rights. So I think the answer is B.\n"
