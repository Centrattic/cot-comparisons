And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the described situation is in the wrong. The author installed a lock on their bedroom door to prevent their wife from taking their cheese, which they consider contaminated by her unwashed hands after biting her nails.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate concern about hygiene. Eating food that someone else has touched with unwashed hands, especially after nail-biting, could be unsanitary. They tried solutions like buying separate cheese and a mini fridge, but their wife still accessed the cheese. The final step was locking the room, which the author feels is necessary to protect their personal food.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions might be seen as a matter of habit and perhaps lack of awareness. The author's response of locking the room could be seen as extreme, creating a physical barrier in their shared living space. The wife's argument that they kiss all the time implies she doesn't see the same level of risk, which is a common perspective in relationships where shared intimacy is considered hygienically acceptable.\n\nNow, the key points are consent and mutual respect. The author's actions are about personal boundaries regarding food, which is important. However, locking the bedroom door might infringe on the wife's expectations of shared access to common areas. In many relationships, bedrooms are considered shared spaces, so locking it could be seen as isolating or distrustful. The author's justification is about hygiene, but the solution might be disproportionate. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because their actions stem from a reasonable concern for their health and personal space. They've made multiple attempts to resolve the issue without confrontation before taking the final step. However, the lock might be seen as an overreaction. But considering the context\u2014trying to protect their own food from contamination\u2014it's a valid personal choice. The wife's actions are the initial problem, so the author's response is a defense of their personal boundaries.\n"
