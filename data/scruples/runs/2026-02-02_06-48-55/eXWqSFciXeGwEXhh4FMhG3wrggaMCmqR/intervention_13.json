And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. Their wife takes their cheese and contaminates it with her unwashed hands right after biting her nails. The author buys a separate fridge and labels the cheese, but the wife still ends up with the author's cheese. So they lock the door to prevent it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and shared living spaces. The author clearly has a strong aversion to the way their wife handles the cheese, which they find unhygienic. They took steps to separate their belongings, but the wife didn't respect that. The author's solution was to lock their bedroom door, which is where their fridge is. \n\nNow, in a shared home, people usually share common areas like the kitchen and living room. Bedrooms are typically considered more private. The author's fridge is in their private space, so locking the door to keep their belongings safe might be seen as reasonable. However, the wife might feel that the author is being overly possessive or not considering her needs. The author's motivation is hygiene, which is valid, but the solution involves restricting access to a private room, which could be seen as an overreaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife isn't respecting the author's efforts to maintain hygiene. She's using the author's resources without consent. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect their personal space and belongings. So while the author's actions might seem extreme, they are trying to maintain their own standards of cleanliness. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and mutual respect. If the wife is using the author's fridge in their bedroom without permission, then the author is within their rights to lock it. But if the fridge is in a shared space, maybe it's different. In this case, the fridge is in the author's bedroom, which is their private area. So locking it isn't necessarily wrong. The wife's actions of taking the cheese without consent are the issue here. The author is defending their personal space and hygiene, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
