And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands properly. The author likes to snack on shredded cheese. The wife takes his cheese, uses her unwashed hands (after her mouth) to grab it, which he finds gross. So he buys her her own cheese, labels them, but she still ends up taking his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, which she ignores and eats the cheese from. Finally, he locks his bedroom door to prevent her access. The wife is upset, but he argues it's about food safety and cleanliness.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and shared living space. The author wants to maintain personal space for his snacks, but does locking his bedroom door go too far? Well, they have separate bedrooms, so maybe that's a given. But the mini fridge in his room is his way of keeping his stuff. However, when the wife enters his room and eats the cheese despite the lock, he locks it. But wait, he initially left it open, right? Then after she took it, he locked it. \n\nI think the author's actions are about personal hygiene and boundaries. He's not preventing her from eating cheese in general, just his own. The wife might feel it's unfair, but the author's reasoning is about cleanliness. However, using a deadbolt might be seen as overreacting. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using a lock without a deadbolt, or better communication. But in terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to protect his personal space and health. The wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the author's response could be seen as necessary. On the other hand, maybe there's a lack of compromise. But overall, if they have separate rooms, having a lock isn't unreasonable. So I think the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
