And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is about a husband who is upset because his wife is taking his cheese from the fridge. He mentions she has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which he finds disgusting when she puts her hands into his cheese. He tried several steps: buying her her own cheese, labeling them, then getting a mini fridge in his bedroom. But she still took his cheese, so he locked his room. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is about personal space and food preferences. The husband is concerned about hygiene and wants to ensure his food isn't contaminated. The wife, on the other hand, seems to not understand or care about his specific concerns. \n\nHe tried multiple solutions: buying separate bags, labeling them, and even a mini fridge. But she still ended up taking his. That shows he's made efforts to accommodate her while maintaining his own preferences. The final step was locking his room, which is where the conflict arises. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong for locking his room? Well, if they have separate bedrooms, then his room is his private space. Locking it when he's not there is a way to protect his belongings. However, some might argue that it's an overreaction or creates a barrier in their relationship. Others might see it as a reasonable step to respect his hygiene needs. \n\nThe wife's argument is that they kiss, so it shouldn't matter. But he's clear that it's about food safety. So it's a matter of differing standards. The question is whether his actions cross a line. Locking the door is a personal choice, especially if it's his own space. Unless the wife has a right to access his room, which might depend on their living arrangements and agreements. \n\nIn many cases, people have separate private spaces and lock them. So unless there's a specific reason (like safety concerns, or if it's a shared space), he's probably within his rights. The problem might be more about communication. Did he talk to his wife first? The story suggests he tried multiple steps before locking the door, so communication might have been attempted. \n\nBut some might say that locking the door is extreme and could cause more issues. However, from his perspective, it's necessary. The answer depends on whether the actions are seen as reasonable. Given that he's taken steps to accommodate her and still needed to protect his own food, many would side with him. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
