And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses her fingers in the cheese. The author is really put off by this because of hygiene. They tried labeling the cheese, but the wife still took the wrong one. Then they got a mini fridge in their bedroom, but the wife still accessed it. Finally, they locked the door. The wife is upset, saying they still kiss, so it shouldn't matter. The author argues about food safety.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their personal space and food from what they see as a hygiene issue. They've made compromises by buying separate cheese and a mini fridge. The lock seems like a personal boundary to protect their belongings. On the other hand, their wife might feel that the lock is cutting her off unnecessarily, especially since they share a home. The issue here is about mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nBut the key point is that the author's actions are about personal hygiene and food safety. They\u2019re not keeping the wife from having cheese; they\u2019re just securing their own. The wife's actions are what's causing the problem. However, installing a lock might be seen as an overreaction or creating a physical barrier that wasn't there before, which could affect trust or intimacy. But if the author is not using the lock to keep the wife out of the room entirely but just to protect their cheese, then it's more about personal space and belongings.\n\nAnother angle: in a shared home, there's an expectation of shared access to common areas. But since they have separate bedrooms, the author's bedroom is their personal space. Locking the door isn't unreasonable if it's their room. However, the wife might feel it's a step back from sharing the space. But the author's primary concern is about their own food safety, which is a valid personal preference.\n\nIn many relationships, people have different boundaries. The author is setting a boundary to protect their comfort, which is understandable. The wife's reaction could be about feeling that the author is being overly controlling, but the author is just trying to accommodate their own needs without affecting the wife's access to her own cheese. The fact that the author is buying separate cheese shows they're making an effort, but the wife isn't respecting the labels, leading to the lock as a final measure.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're protecting their own space and hygiene preferences. While the lock might be seen as a bit extreme, it's a response to a persistent problem they've tried to resolve in other ways. The wife's actions (eating from the mini fridge despite it being in the bedroom) are what started the issue, so the author's reaction is about self-respect and health concerns. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
