And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his cheese safe from his wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the situation: the wife takes the author's cheese after using her hands in her mouth, which he finds unsanitary. He tried labeling, then a mini fridge, but she still took his cheese. Now he locked his room.\n\nThe main points to consider are boundaries, shared living space, and mutual respect. In a shared home, people usually expect some compromise. The author's solution of a locked room might be seen as overreacting. While his desire for clean food is valid, using a deadbolt could be perceived as isolating himself, which might strain the relationship. \n\nHowever, the wife's actions are also problematic. She's not respecting his preference and is using his cheese despite his efforts. The author isn't keeping her out entirely; he's just securing his own space. But locking the bedroom could lead to feelings of being excluded or not trusted. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing and saliva might not address the actual issue of hygiene and contamination the author is concerned about. Still, the solution (locking the room) might cross a line. \n\nBalancing both sides, the author's actions are extreme but stem from a legitimate concern. However, in a relationship, communication and finding a less drastic solution might be better. So, the author is in the wrong because a deadbolt is an extreme measure that could harm their relationship more than the initial issue.\n"
