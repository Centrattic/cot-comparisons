And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is the person asking the \"AITA\" question) is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door. The scenario involves the author's wife taking his cheese after using her hands, which he finds unhygienic because she bites her nails and doesn't wash them. He's tried several steps to prevent this, including buying her her own cheese, getting a mini fridge, and finally locking the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken by the author. The core issue is about personal boundaries and hygiene. The author feels that his food should be uncontaminated, which is a valid health concern for many people. However, the solution he's taken\u2014locking the bedroom door\u2014might be seen as extreme.\n\nThe wife's actions of taking the cheese could be seen as inconsiderate from the author's perspective, but maybe she's not aware of how it's affecting him. The author has tried multiple steps before locking the door, which shows he's made an effort to resolve the issue amicably. The final step, locking the door, is a physical barrier that might be necessary for him to feel in control of his space and food.\n\nOn the other hand, having separate bedrooms and then locking the door could create tension. The wife might feel that her partner is being overly controlling or that there's a lack of communication. The fact that the author mentions they kiss often but still has hygiene concerns about the cheese might be a point of contention. However, the author's justification is about personal hygiene, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nThe question is whether his actions are wrong. Since the author explains his reasons clearly and has taken steps to accommodate both parties (buying her own cheese, mini fridge), the final act of locking the door is a reasonable measure from his perspective. The wife's reaction might be part of the problem if she's not respecting his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people have different levels of personal space and hygiene. What's considered reasonable can vary. However, the author hasn't acted out of malice but to protect his own preferences, even though the solution might seem drastic. Therefore, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's asserting his right to personal space and food hygiene, even if the method is extreme.\n"
