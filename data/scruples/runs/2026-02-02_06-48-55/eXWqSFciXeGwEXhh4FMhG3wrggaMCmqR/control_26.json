And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses them to take cheese from his bag in the fridge. He starts labeling bags, but she still ends up with his cheese. Then he buys a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still accesses it. Finally, he locks the door.\n\nThe main issue is about personal boundaries and food safety. The author is concerned about germs and wants his cheese to be untouched. He's not stopping her from eating, just protecting his own. \n\nNow, considering the options. If the answer is A (author is wrong), maybe it's about overreacting or not considering the wife's perspective. If B (not wrong), it's about respecting boundaries and personal preferences.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be about personal hygiene and autonomy. Even though they share a home, having separate spaces and food storage isn't unreasonable. The wife's actions are invasive to his personal items. Locking the room is a way to enforce that boundary. \n\nBut some might say it's excessive, but food safety is a valid concern. He's not cutting her off entirely, just keeping his cheese separate. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering doesn't address the specific issue of food contamination. \n\nSo, the author's actions are about protecting his own preferences and health, which isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
