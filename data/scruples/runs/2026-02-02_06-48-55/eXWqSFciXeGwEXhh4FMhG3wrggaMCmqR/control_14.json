And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. The husband likes to eat shredded cheese, but the wife uses his bag after her nails, which he finds gross. He starts labeling bags, but she ignores the labels. He buys a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still takes his cheese. Finally, he locks his room when he's not there.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, the core issue is about personal boundaries and shared living spaces. The husband is trying to protect his personal food from what he perceives as contamination. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that since they're married and share a home, his actions are over the top.\n\nIn a shared living situation, people often have different levels of cleanliness and personal space. The husband's actions are about maintaining his own standards, which is reasonable. However, installing a lock might be seen as extreme because bedrooms are typically considered private spaces. But since they already have separate bedrooms, maybe the husband's need for privacy is justified. He's not keeping her out of the room, just securing his belongings when he's not there. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. If she respects the labels and the fridge but still takes his cheese, maybe she's not being considerate of his preferences. The husband's main issue is the hygiene of his food, which is a valid concern. So, he's trying to solve the problem by securing his food. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the husband should communicate his feelings more clearly or find a compromise. But he has tried labeling and separate storage. Locking the door is a final step to protect his personal stuff. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The husband isn't doing anything illegal or unethical, just protecting his belongings. The wife's actions are the root of the problem, but the husband's response is about maintaining his personal standards. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
