And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese away from their wife. The key points here are about personal boundaries, shared living space, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is with their wife's habit of using her fingers in her mouth and then handling their cheese without washing her hands. They find this disgusting and want their cheese to be clean. They tried labeling the cheese, giving her her own, and even getting a mini fridge. But when that didn't work, they locked their room to keep the cheese safe.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they have a legitimate concern about hygiene. Everyone has different comfort levels with personal space and cleanliness. The author is trying to protect their own food from what they perceive as contamination. They are also not cutting off their wife from food; they're just keeping their own portion safe.\n\nOn the other hand, installing a lock on the bedroom door might be seen as overstepping. In a shared living situation, especially in a marriage, there's an expectation of shared access to common areas. Bedrooms can sometimes be more private, but if the couple is sleeping in separate rooms, maybe the expectation of privacy is different. However, locking the door could be seen as creating a barrier that wasn't there before. The wife might feel that her access to the husband's space is being unfairly restricted, even if it's just for the cheese.\n\nThe author's wife is upset because she can't access his cheese, but she's also not respecting his boundaries regarding hygiene. The author is trying to enforce their own standards, which is their right. But at the same time, the wife might feel disrespected or excluded. The fact that they kiss and share intimacy complicates things because the author's argument that germs matter for food but not for kissing could be a point of contention. However, that's a personal preference and doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nThe wife's actions of taking the labeled cheese and not respecting the labels could be the root of the problem. The author is reacting to her not following the rules they set up to protect their food. The lock is a final measure to prevent further issues. While it's a drastic step, it's a solution that works for the author to solve the problem without causing conflict over the cheese itself.\n\nIn terms of shared living, everyone has to compromise. The author is compromising by buying extra cheese for the wife, but she's not respecting his boundaries. The lock is a way to maintain that compromise without further arguments. It's a bit of a humorous situation, but the core issue is about mutual respect for each other's preferences and boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky call. The action of locking the door is a personal choice to protect their own property and hygiene standards. However, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not considering her perspective. But given the context, the author is trying to solve a problem that the wife isn't addressing. The answer might depend on whether the lock is seen as a reasonable measure given the circumstances. Since the author isn't preventing the wife from accessing food in general, just their own portion, it's a bit of a gray area. But I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a valid concern and are setting boundaries to address it.\n"
