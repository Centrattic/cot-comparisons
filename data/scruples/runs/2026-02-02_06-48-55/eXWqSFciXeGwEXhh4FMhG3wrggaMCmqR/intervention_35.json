And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is married and has a problem with their wife eating their cheese. The wife bites her nails and doesn't keep her hands clean. The author likes to eat shredded cheese, but the wife takes the cheese from the fridge and sticks her unwashed hands into it after licking her fingers. The author started labeling the cheese bags, but the wife still took the wrong one. Then the author bought a mini fridge and put it in their separate bedroom, but the wife still accessed the cheese. So, the author installed a lock on the bedroom door to keep their cheese safe. Now the wife is upset, and the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is about personal hygiene and food safety. They feel disgusted by the wife's actions, which they see as unsanitary. Their solution was to lock the bedroom door to protect their cheese. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not trusting her. The author's action of locking the door could be seen as a personal choice, especially since they mention that they have separate bedrooms, which might be common in some marriages. However, is there a point where personal boundaries become unreasonable?\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't mention discussing the issue with their wife before taking such steps. The wife might feel that the locking of the door is an overreaction, especially if they are married and sharing a home. While food safety is a valid concern, the solution of locking the door might be seen as extreme. It could also create tension in the relationship. However, the author's emphasis is on their own comfort and health, which they have a right to prioritize. \n\nBut the line between personal space and overstepping might be a factor here. In a shared living situation, having separate bedrooms isn't unusual, but locking the door could be perceived as cutting off access to a shared space. The author might be justified in wanting their own space, but the method they chose could be problematic if it's causing unnecessary conflict. The wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the response of locking the door might be seen as an overreaction, especially if there wasn't a prior discussion to address the issue mutually.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be in the wrong because they took a drastic measure without trying to resolve the issue through communication first. While their concern for hygiene is valid, the solution they chose could be seen as excessive and potentially hurtful to the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
