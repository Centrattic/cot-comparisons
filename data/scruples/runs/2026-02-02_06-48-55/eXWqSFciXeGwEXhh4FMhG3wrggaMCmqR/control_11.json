And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about the wife taking his cheese, and he's installed a lock on his bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his fridge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not keeping her hands clean. She puts her fingers into his cheese after her mouth, which he finds disgusting. He's tried labeling the cheese, buying her her own, and even a mini fridge in his room, but she still ends up taking his. Now he's locked the door to keep her out.\n\nFrom his perspective, it's about personal hygiene and food safety. He wants his cheese to be clean, free from germs. That's a valid concern for him. But from her side, she might feel that he's being controlling or not trusting her. The question is whether his actions are reasonable.\n\nSeparate bedrooms might make the mini fridge setup a bit unusual, but maybe they have a specific living arrangement. However, locking the bedroom door when he's not there seems a bit extreme. It's his room, so he has the right to privacy and security. But does locking the door prevent her from accessing his fridge? If the fridge is in the bedroom, then yes, it's his space. But maybe she has a key or another way in?\n\nHe says it's not about money, just about his personal preference. She argues that since they kiss, it shouldn't matter. But he's not against kissing; it's about the specific contamination he's worried about. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's taken steps to protect his food from his own habits. The wife's actions are causing the problem, but he's responding in a way that's isolating. Is it fair for him to lock her out? Well, he owns the room, so he can lock it. But maybe there's a middle ground. Maybe discussing the issue more, finding another solution instead of locking the door.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's just trying to protect his own property (the cheese) in his own room, then technically he's not. However, some might argue that the solution is over the top and could be hurtful to the relationship. But others might say he has every right to his personal space and preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because he's protecting his own space and hygiene. But some might say A because it's an extreme measure. However, the key here is that it's his room and his fridge, so locking it isn't against any rules. The main issue is mutual respect and communication. If he's not violating any rights, then he's not in the wrong.\n"
