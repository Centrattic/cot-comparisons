And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps using his cheese. He's installed a lock on his bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his fridge where his cheese is stored. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then uses her hands to get cheese from his fridge. The husband is disturbed by this because he wants his cheese to be clean. So he buys a mini fridge for his room, but she still goes in and takes his cheese. Then he locks the door.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife is using his cheese despite him setting boundaries. He's provided her with her own cheese, but she ignored the labels. He even went as far as getting a separate fridge, which she bypassed. The lock is the next step to protect his personal space and items. \n\nFrom a personal property standpoint, the husband has a right to control access to his room and his belongings. His main concern is hygiene, which is a valid personal preference. The wife's actions are crossing his boundaries, so locking the door to prevent her from entering seems like a reasonable step to protect his own items. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of marriage and shared spaces. In many relationships, partners share some resources. However, the husband is not stopping her from eating her own cheese; he's just securing his own. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering is dismissive of his personal boundaries. \n\nSo, considering the actions taken, the husband's actions are about respecting his own boundaries and health concerns. Unless there's a cultural or legal expectation that they share all food equally, which isn't mentioned here, the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
