And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband who keeps his cheese locked in his bedroom to prevent his wife from eating it, after she contaminates it by using her hands after biting her nails and not washing them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband has a legitimate concern about hygiene. His wife's habit of not washing hands after biting nails and putting her fingers into his cheese is causing him discomfort. He's tried several solutions: buying her her own cheese, labeling them, getting a mini fridge. But she keeps accessing his. So he locks his bedroom door.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong for doing so. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, it's his home, and he has a right to privacy and to set boundaries to protect his personal items and health. Everyone has different tolerance levels for cleanliness. If her actions are making him sick or causing him significant stress, he's justified in taking measures to protect himself.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the husband is being overly controlling. While the husband's intention is to maintain hygiene, the action of locking the bedroom could be seen as cutting off shared access to common areas or items. However, since they already have separate bedrooms, the husband's decision to lock his room might not be unreasonable. The key point is that the husband is not restricting her from her own space or basic needs, just preventing her from accessing his personal stash.\n\nAlso, the wife's argument about kissing doesn't address the husband's specific concern about the cheese. Kissing doesn't equate to eating from a shared, contaminated food source. The husband's request is about his personal preference for cleanliness, which should be respected unless it's causing harm beyond his own preferences.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's actions are reasonable. He tried multiple steps to resolve the issue, and the lock is a final measure to protect his personal property. The wife's actions are the ones causing the problem, not the husband's solution. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
