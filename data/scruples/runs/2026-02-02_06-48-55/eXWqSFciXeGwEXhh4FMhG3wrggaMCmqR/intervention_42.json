And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who is upset because his wife takes his cheese from the fridge after handling her nails and without washing her hands. He tries several solutions, including buying her her own cheese, a mini fridge, and finally locking his bedroom door. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions taken by the author. The main issue here is about personal boundaries and shared living spaces. The author is concerned about hygiene and wants to ensure his food isn't contaminated. On the other hand, the wife's actions are seen as intrusive. \n\nThe author starts by labeling cheese bags, but the wife ignores the labels. Then he gets a mini fridge, but she still accesses his cheese in his bedroom. The final step is installing a lock on his bedroom door. Now, in many households, sharing a living space might require some compromise. The act of locking the bedroom door could be seen as an overreaction, especially since the couple kisses each other, implying they share bodily fluids. But the husband's concern is about food safety and personal preference, which is valid for some people.\n\nHowever, the wife's perspective might be that the husband is being possessive or overly controlling. The husband's solution of locking the door might be seen as unnecessary because the cheese was in a shared space. The wife might feel that he's making it more difficult for himself to access his own space or that he's treating her unfairly by restricting her access to his room. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect some level of privacy in their bedrooms, but the way the husband handled the situation\u2014especially after the wife had access to his room\u2014could be seen as an escalation. The wife's actions, while unhygienic in the husband's view, aren't necessarily malicious. The husband's solution, while solving his problem, might be causing tension in the relationship by creating physical barriers. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect in a shared living situation. The husband's need for cleanliness is understandable, but the way he addressed it might have crossed a line. He could have tried communication or other non-intrusive methods before resorting to locking her out. The wife's not respecting the labels and accessing the cheese despite the mini fridge might show a lack of consideration, but the husband's response of locking the door could be seen as an overreach. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he took an extreme measure (locking the door) that affects the wife's access to a shared space, even if the underlying issue is valid. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, if the husband's actions are seen as necessary for his personal comfort and he's not harming the wife, some might argue it's not his fault. But typically, in such scenarios, the solution that causes more friction (like a lock) is considered a problem.\n"
