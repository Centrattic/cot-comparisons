And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is upset because his wife takes his cheese, opens it after biting her nails and not washing her hands, then later eats his cheese again. He tries to solve this by buying separate bags, labeling them, but she still takes his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still eats his cheese. So he locks his room to stop her. The wife thinks it's not a big deal.\n\nHmm. The core issue is about personal boundaries and food safety. The husband has a legitimate concern about hygiene. He's not just being petty; he's trying to protect his health. The wife's actions are causing him distress. But the solution he took (locking the bedroom door) might be seen as extreme. \n\nWait, they have separate bedrooms. So the husband's bedroom is his space. If he locks it, that's his right. But maybe there's a social expectation that sharing a home allows some access? But they already have separate rooms. So maybe the lock is justified.\n\nBut the wife might feel that the husband is being overly controlling. However, the husband's main point is about food safety, not controlling her. The cheese is a personal item for him, and he's trying to ensure it's not contaminated. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's actions stem from a valid concern. He's not harming her by locking his room; he's protecting his own belongings and health. The wife's actions (eating his cheese without consent after contaminating it) are the initial issue. So the husband's response is a reasonable boundary, given the circumstances. \n\nBut maybe some would say that the husband should have communicated better or found another solution. However, he did try separate bags and a mini fridge, which she ignored. Locking the door is the next step to protect his space and food. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries for his own comfort and hygiene. The wife's actions are the problem here, not the husband's solution. Unless there's a cultural or social norm that deems locking the bedroom door as unreasonable in a marriage, but since they have separate rooms, it's probably acceptable.\n"
