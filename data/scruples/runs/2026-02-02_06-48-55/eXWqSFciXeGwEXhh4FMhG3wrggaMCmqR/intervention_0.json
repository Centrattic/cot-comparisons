And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who installed a lock on their bedroom door because their wife keeps taking their cheese. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which the author finds gross. The author tried several steps: labeling the cheese bags, getting a mini fridge, but the wife still took the cheese from the bedroom. Now the room is locked, and the author is justifying it by saying they want their cheese to be clean.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's main issue is about food safety and personal space. The wife isn't respecting the author's request to not touch their cheese, leading to the author taking extreme measures. But is locking the bedroom door over cheese reasonable?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid point about wanting their food to be clean and uncontaminated. They've made efforts to accommodate their wife (buying her own cheese, using labels, even a mini fridge). But when those didn't work, they resorted to locking the door, which the wife might see as overreacting or being controlling. The wife might feel that the author is being possessive or not considering her needs. Also, the fact that they have separate bedrooms adds context. Maybe the wife didn't realize the author was so sensitive about the cheese, or perhaps she didn't think locking the room was necessary.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author might have failed to communicate their feelings effectively. Instead of locking the door, maybe a discussion could have resolved the issue. The wife's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but the author's solution is extreme. However, the author's actions are a response to their wife's repeated disregard for their boundaries. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Locking the bedroom door could be seen as a reasonable measure if all other attempts to resolve the issue failed and the author feels their personal space is being invaded. However, it might also be seen as unnecessary and creating more separation in the relationship. The wife's argument about kissing (implying oral contact is similar) is a counterpoint, but the author's concern is about germs in food, which is a valid health concern for some people.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions might be justified from their perspective, but they could be seen as overreacting. The wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the author's solution is extreme. However, since the author has tried multiple solutions and the wife continues to ignore the boundaries, the author's final step might be a reasonable last resort to protect their own preferences and health. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground they didn't consider, like open communication. But given the scenario, the author's actions are a response to the wife not respecting their wishes, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
