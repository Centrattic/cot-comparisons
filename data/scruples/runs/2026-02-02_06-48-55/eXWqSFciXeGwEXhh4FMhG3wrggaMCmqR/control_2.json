And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who's frustrated with his wife's habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which leads to her contaminating his cheese. He buys a mini fridge, puts it in his bedroom, and eventually locks his door to keep her from taking his cheese.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's main issue is about personal boundaries and food safety. He's clearly communicated his discomfort, labeled the cheese, moved it to a mini fridge in his room, and then locked his room. The wife, however, still takes the cheese from his room, even though there's plenty in the main fridge. \n\nThe wife's perspective isn't fully given, but she argues that they kiss all the time, implying she doesn't see the issue. The husband's stance is about hygiene and control over his own food. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong for installing a lock. \n\nLegally, in most places, a married couple shares a home, but they do have separate bedrooms here. If the mini fridge is in his room, then physically, he's within his right to lock his door. The problem is more about the marital dynamic. The wife might feel that locking the door is a form of separation or exclusion, which could be seen as a breach of trust or shared living. However, the husband is trying to protect his personal space and preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a marriage, you should consider each other's habits and find compromises. The husband's solution is to lock his door, which is a physical barrier. Maybe there's a lack of communication or understanding. But the husband has tried several steps before locking the door: buying separate cheese, labeling, moving the fridge. The wife didn't respect those boundaries, so the lock is a final step.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's actions are reasonable for maintaining his personal space and health standards. Since he's not restricting her access to food entirely but just his own, and he's in his own bedroom, legally and in terms of personal rights, he's probably not in the wrong. However, in terms of marital harmony, there might be issues. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the relationship's health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). His actions are about protecting his personal space and health preferences, and he's taken steps that are within his rights as a homeowner or resident.\n"
