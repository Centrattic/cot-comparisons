And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the main issue is the wife taking the cheese. The author is concerned about hygiene because she puts unwashed hands into his cheese after biting her nails. He tried labeling the cheese and even got a separate fridge, but she still took his. Then he locked his room to prevent access.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, he's trying to protect his personal item (the cheese) from being used without his consent. He's not being violent or harmful, just setting boundaries. The wife, however, might feel disrespected by being locked out. But the author's main point is about hygiene and personal choice. \n\nIn terms of rights, people generally have the right to control their personal space and belongings. The author isn't hoarding or being unreasonable about the cheese; it's about his preference for cleanliness. The wife's actions are intrusive, so the author's response is a reasonable way to enforce his boundaries. \n\nThe wife's argument that they share saliva through kissing doesn't address the specific issue of germs from hands in the cheese. The author's need for his cheese to be clean is a legitimate personal preference. So, he's not in the wrong for taking steps to protect his property and health.\n"
