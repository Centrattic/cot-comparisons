And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese with unwashed hands after biting her nails. He goes through several steps to prevent this, like buying her her own cheese, then a mini fridge, and finally locking his bedroom door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his motivations. He's concerned about hygiene and food safety. That's understandable, especially if he's particular about what he eats. The wife's habit of not washing hands after biting nails and then putting her fingers into his cheese is definitely a hygiene issue. So his actions are driven by wanting to protect his own food from contamination.\n\nNow, the wife's perspective: maybe she doesn't see the problem as big as he does. She might not realize how important it is to him, or she might think they're already intimate enough that sharing food isn't an issue. But from his point of view, the fact that they kiss a lot doesn't negate his need for his cheese to be clean. People have different thresholds for hygiene, right?\n\nHe took steps to address the issue first by labeling the cheese, then getting a mini fridge. But the wife still took his cheese. So he locks his room to prevent access. Is that over the line? Well, he mentions they have separate bedrooms, so locking his door to keep her out isn't about controlling her, but protecting his personal space and belongings. If the bedrooms are already separate, then having a lock for privacy is reasonable. Unless she has a key or access, which he's now preventing by locking it when he's not there.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for doing that. On one hand, he's protecting his own preferences and health. On the other, maybe he's being too controlling. But since it's his room and he's not restricting her from her own space, just his, it's more about personal boundaries. The problem is mutual respect\u2014does she have a right to access his room, or is he within his rights to keep it locked?\n\nLegally, in a shared home, each person might have the right to lock their private space. Emotionally, maybe there's a communication gap. But the author's actions seem to be about personal hygiene and protecting his own property. The wife's actions (taking his cheese despite labels and a mini fridge) might be inconsiderate, but he's responding in a way that's reasonable for his needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong). He's taking reasonable steps to protect his own preferences and hygiene without infringing on her rights beyond his own space.\n"
