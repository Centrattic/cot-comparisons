And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then puts her hands into the author's cheese. The author is bothered by this and starts buying separate cheese, labeling them, but the wife keeps taking the wrong ones. Eventually, the author gets a mini fridge in the bedroom and locks it to prevent her from accessing his cheese.\n\nThe author's main issue is about personal space and food safety. He wants his food to be clean and uncontaminated. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that sharing food is normal in a marriage and that the author is being overly restrictive. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms and relationships. In many relationships, sharing food is common, especially in shared living spaces. The author is taking steps to separate his food to the extent of having a separate fridge and locking his room. That might be seen as extreme by some, as it creates a barrier that wasn't there before. The wife's argument is that they kiss, implying that they exchange saliva anyway, so the cheese shouldn't be a problem. The author counters with food safety concerns.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's actions are to protect his personal preferences and health concerns. If the wife isn't respecting his boundaries (like using the labels), then the author has a right to take further steps to protect his belongings. However, locking the bedroom door and creating a physical barrier might be seen as overreacting and could harm the relationship. The question is whether personal choice and boundaries override the expectation of shared space in a marriage.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to his own personal space and food, the wife's right to shared space, and the escalation from separate labels to a locked room. The author's actions are a response to a problem he's facing, but they might be seen as unnecessary if the wife isn't respecting his initial boundaries. However, if the wife is repeatedly violating his wishes, then the author's actions are a form of self-preservation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting his own preferences, but the method of doing so might be seen as excessive. However, since the problem started with the wife's actions (taking the cheese), the author's response is a way to enforce his boundaries. The answer might depend on cultural context, but generally, people might sympathize with both sides. However, the act of locking the bedroom door might be seen as taking it too far, hence the author could be in the wrong.\n"
