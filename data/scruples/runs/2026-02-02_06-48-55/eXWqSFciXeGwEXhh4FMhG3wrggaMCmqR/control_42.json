And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese separate from their wife's. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, then puts her hands into his cheese. He buys separate bags, labels them, but she ignores the labels and takes his. He gets a mini fridge in his room, but she still takes his cheese. So he locks the door to prevent that.\n\nNow, determining right or wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries, shared living spaces, and mutual respect. The author has a valid concern about hygiene and personal preferences. However, the wife might feel that the solution (locking the bedroom door) is excessive, especially since they have separate rooms. \n\nIn a shared household, there's an expectation of respecting each other's preferences without causing undue inconvenience. The author tried several steps before locking the door. The lock might be seen as overreacting because it's a bedroom, which is typically a private space. However, the wife's actions (ignoring labels, eating from the mini fridge) might justify the author's need for control over his own space.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the author's solution might infringe on the wife's access to a shared space. However, since they have separate bedrooms, the author's room is his private space, so locking it isn't inherently wrong. The main issue is the cheese contamination, which the author is trying to address. \n\nIn terms of food safety, the author's concern is legitimate. The wife's habit is unsanitary, and the author has the right to protect his food. The lock is a direct response to a recurring problem. While it might seem extreme, it's a solution the author came up with after other attempts failed. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering doesn't address the specific hygiene issue with the cheese. \n\nSo considering all factors, the author's actions are a reasonable response to protect his personal health and preferences, even if the method seems harsh. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
