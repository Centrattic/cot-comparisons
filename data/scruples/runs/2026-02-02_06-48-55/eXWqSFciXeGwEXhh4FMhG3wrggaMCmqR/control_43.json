And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who installed a lock on their bedroom door is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife taking his cheese after handling her nails and not washing her hands. He's tried various things like labeling the cheese, getting a mini fridge, but she still ends up with his cheese. Now he's locked the door to keep his cheese safe. The wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The husband is concerned about hygiene. His wife's behavior is making him uncomfortable. He's taken steps to separate their belongings, but she's not respecting that. The key issue here is about personal boundaries and respect for each other's preferences.\n\nIs it reasonable for him to want his food to be untouched by others? Well, food safety is a valid concern for many people. Different people have different standards, and if he's uncomfortable with her germs on his food, that's his right. On the other hand, the wife might feel that since they're married, sharing food is normal. But he's not stopping her from eating cheese; he's just keeping his own separate. \n\nHe installed a lock in their shared bedroom because she kept entering and taking his stuff. Wait, they have separate bedrooms now? The user mentions they have separate bedrooms, but she went into his room. If they're in separate bedrooms, then her entering his room without permission is an issue. However, if they're married, the house is shared, so maybe he can't lock her out entirely? But he's only locking it when he's not there, so she can't take his cheese. \n\nIs locking the door an overreaction? Maybe. Some might see it as unnecessary, especially if communication failed. Did he talk to her about his concerns before taking these steps? He tried labeling and buying separate fridges, but she didn't respect that. The mini fridge in his room was supposed to solve it, but she still took it. So he's escalating to prevent her access. \n\nThe wife's argument is that they kiss, so germs shouldn't matter. But that's not a valid argument for his personal standards. The problem is about his comfort with germs, not hers. \n\nIs the husband wrong for wanting his food to be clean? Probably not. He's justified in his hygiene concerns. The real question is whether locking the door is a reasonable response. If they have separate bedrooms, then locking his door when he's not there is his right, as it's his personal space. However, if the bedroom is considered a shared space, locking her out might be an issue. But the user states they have separate bedrooms, so maybe it's his own room. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his personal space and hygiene preferences, which is reasonable. The wife should respect his boundaries. However, communication is key here. If he didn't discuss his feelings with her, that's a separate issue, but the actions he took are a response to her not respecting his wishes. \n\nSo the answer is B.\n"
