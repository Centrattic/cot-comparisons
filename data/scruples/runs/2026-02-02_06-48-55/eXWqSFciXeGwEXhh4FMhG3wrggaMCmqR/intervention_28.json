And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their wife from eating their cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is that their wife takes their cheese after touching it with her unwashed hands and bitten nails. They took steps like buying separate bags, a mini fridge, and finally locking the bedroom door. The wife feels it's not a big deal because they kiss, but the author is concerned about hygiene.\n\nThe wife's habits are clearly a problem for the author's personal comfort and hygiene. But when it comes to the solution, installing a lock on the bedroom door\u2014especially if they have separate bedrooms\u2014might be seen as overreacting. Even though the author has their own room, locking it completely when not there might be an unnecessary escalation. \n\nSeparate bedrooms aren't common in many relationships, so maybe the expectation of privacy is already there. However, the wife might feel it's an overreaction to lock the door just to protect cheese. The author's actions could be seen as being overly controlling or not communicating the issue properly before resorting to drastic measures. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author has tried other solutions first: labeling the cheese, putting it in a mini fridge. When that failed, the lock was the next step. The wife's actions of ignoring labels and taking the cheese repeatedly might justify the author's need to secure their belongings. \n\nI need to think about personal boundaries and shared living spaces. In a shared home, even with separate bedrooms, there's an expectation of not interfering with each other's personal items unless it's a safety issue. The author's issue is more about personal preference, not a health hazard. So locking the door to prevent the wife from accessing the cheese might be crossing a line into being overly possessive or not respecting the shared space.\n\nBut the author's reason is hygiene, which is a valid personal standard. However, the solution (locking the door) might be too extreme. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss the issue more openly, maybe find a different storage solution, or maybe compromise on how the cheese is handled. The lock seems like a last resort after other steps failed, but it's possible the author could have communicated more effectively before taking that step.\n\nSo the question is whether the lock is an unreasonable action. The answer might hinge on whether locking the bedroom door is an excessive measure for the problem. Since the wife is eating from the mini fridge in the room, the lock is to prevent access. If they have separate bedrooms, the author has the right to privacy there, but maybe the wife feels it's an overreaction. However, the author's action is to protect their own property and personal preferences. \n\nConsidering all that, I'm leaning towards the author is not in the wrong because they were protecting their personal items from what they perceive as contamination. But some might argue that locking the door is too much. But given the steps taken and the personal hygiene concern, maybe it's justified.\n"
