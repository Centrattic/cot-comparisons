And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for locking their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife who bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands. \n\nFirst, the wife is taking his cheese after using her hands in her mouth, which he finds gross. He tried labeling the cheese, but she didn't check the labels. Then he bought a mini fridge in his room, but she still got into it. Now he's locked the door when he's not there.\n\nHmm. On one hand, he's trying to protect his own food and personal space. He has a valid concern about hygiene. Maybe he's justified in wanting his food to be clean. On the other hand, installing a lock in a shared home might be seen as overreacting. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like talking to her or using separate storage that she can't access without permission. But he's already tried several steps. \n\nThe wife's actions could be considered inconsiderate, but the solution might have strained their relationship. Locking the door might be a privacy issue, but if they have separate bedrooms, maybe it's his space to control. However, is it reasonable to lock the room to the point where his partner can't enter when he's not there? It might come off as exclusionary or distrustful. \n\nBut the core issue is his personal boundaries around food. If he's okay with his wife having her own cheese, but not contaminating his, then the lock is a way to enforce that. The problem is whether the means he used are reasonable. It's a balance between personal preferences and respecting shared living spaces. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because he's protecting his own belongings. However, maybe there's a more collaborative approach. But since he's already tried multiple solutions and the lock is the last step, it might be his right to secure his room. So, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit unsure because it's a personal relationship matter. Maybe the wife's frustration is valid too, but the question is about the author's wrongness.\n"
