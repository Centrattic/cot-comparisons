And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. The situation involves the wife taking the author's cheese, even after labels and a mini fridge were set up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is the hygiene aspect. They don't want their cheese contaminated by the wife's unwashed hands after she bites her nails. That's a valid concern for some people. The steps they took\u2014buying separate cheese, a mini fridge, and locking the room\u2014are measures to protect their personal space and food. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is sharing the same space and might not understand the author's specific hygiene needs. The author's solution of locking the bedroom door could be seen as extreme. It might create tension or a sense of separation in the relationship. The wife might feel excluded or that the author isn't considering her actions' impact. \n\nBut the author's actions are driven by personal health concerns, which they have the right to have. The key here is whether the solution is reasonable. Installing a lock isn't inherently wrong if it's about personal safety or health. However, in a shared living situation, it's important to communicate and find a solution that respects both parties' needs. The author might have tried to address the problem on their own without discussing it with the wife first, which could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about maintaining personal hygiene, which is their right. The wife's habit is a personal choice, but it's affecting the author's food. The fact that they have separate bedrooms might justify the mini fridge, but then the lock on the bedroom door seems like an escalation. It's possible that the author should have discussed the issue more openly instead of taking unilateral steps. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't in the wrong if their actions are to protect their health and they're not infringing on others' rights. However, the method of resolving the conflict by locking the door might not be the best approach. But the question is whether they're at fault. Since the author's actions are based on their personal boundaries and hygiene, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
