And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife is eating his cheese after biting her nails and not washing her hands. He's taken steps to label the cheese, get a mini fridge, and even locked his bedroom door to keep his cheese safe. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife's actions are causing the husband distress because of hygiene issues. He wants his food to be clean, specifically the cheese. His responses include buying her her own cheese, then a mini fridge, then locking his room. The wife is upset because he's keeping her out of his room, even though they have separate bedrooms.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's desire for hygienic food is reasonable. People have different thresholds for what's acceptable, and if the wife's habits make him uncomfortable, he's within his rights to set boundaries. However, installing a lock on a bedroom door might be seen as an overreaction, especially if they live in the same house and the fridge is shared. But since they have separate bedrooms, maybe the lock isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe wife's argument that they kiss, implying that germs aren't a big deal, might not address the husband's specific concern about the cheese. The husband's main issue is the cheese being contaminated by her unwashed hands and the immediate hand movement from mouth to cheese. This is a specific hygiene concern, not just general germs.\n\nThe husband isn't preventing her from eating cheese entirely; he's just protecting his own. He's even bought her her own bags, so she has access. The lock is just to prevent her from entering his room to take his cheese. Since they have their own rooms, locking his door might be his right. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in a shared living space, completely restricting access to a room could be problematic, especially if it's a marital home. But the husband's actions seem focused on protecting his personal food, not excluding her from his space in general. The key point is whether his actions are reasonable given his specific needs and hygiene concerns.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife isn't wrong for having her habits, but the husband isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to protect his food. The locks are a solution he found to maintain his comfort. Unless there's a cultural or legal expectation I'm missing, the husband's actions seem like reasonable self-advocacy for his personal space and hygiene preferences. So, the answer would likely be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
