And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who's upset because his wife keeps taking his cheese, even after he tried multiple solutions like labeling and getting a mini fridge. He eventually locks his bedroom door to prevent her from accessing his cheese. The wife argues that it shouldn't matter since they kiss, but he's concerned about hygiene.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband has a legitimate concern about hygiene and food safety. His wife's habit of biting nails and not washing hands before handling his food is a health issue. He's tried several steps to address this, including buying separate cheese and a mini fridge. When that didn't work, he locked his room. The wife now is upset because he's locking her out of his room.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. The husband's right to control access to his personal belongings, especially in his own room, is a factor. If they have separate bedrooms, then his room is his personal space. Locking it is a reasonable way to protect his belongings. However, maybe there's a communication breakdown. Did he discuss his concerns with her first? The story doesn't mention that, but maybe he did. The wife's argument about kissing is a bit dismissive of his hygiene concerns. However, the act of locking the door might be seen as extreme, but given his repeated attempts to solve the issue without success, it could be justified.\n\nAnother angle is that they are married, so there's an expectation of sharing and mutual respect. But personal boundaries and health concerns are also valid. The husband's actions are about maintaining personal hygiene, which is his right. The wife's actions of taking his cheese repeatedly despite his efforts might be inconsiderate. The question is whether locking the door is a fair response. Since the problem persists even after multiple attempts to solve it, the lock is a final measure to protect his own space and belongings.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that in a marriage, such actions could create distance. But the husband's main issue is about his own health and comfort. If he's not infringing on her rights (since it's his room), then locking it isn't wrong. The wife has access to her own cheese, so it's not about denying her food but about keeping his separate.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's actions are a reasonable response to protect his personal space and hygiene, given the wife's repeated disregard for his preferences despite his efforts. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
