And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who locks his bedroom door to prevent his wife from taking his cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is upset because his wife takes his cheese with unwashed hands after biting her nails. He labels the cheese bags, but she ignores the labels. So he gets a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still takes it. Finally, he locks the door to keep his cheese safe. He argues that it's about food safety and he doesn't want his cheese contaminated.\n\nNow, considering the options: AITA? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my take. \n\nI need to analyze both sides. The husband's actions are about personal hygiene and food safety. He's not trying to be mean but to protect his health. On the other hand, his wife might feel that sharing space and resources is part of marriage. But the husband clearly states he's okay with her eating cheese, just not his. The lock is to protect his specific preferences.\n\nIs locking the door reasonable? Maybe. He has separate bedrooms, so the mini fridge was already a step. The lock is just an extension to prevent the wife from accessing his personal items. The wife's argument about kissing might downplay his concerns, but he's justified in wanting his food to be clean. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe, but the husband is taking steps to meet his needs. He's not denying her cheese, just protecting his own. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's asserting his right to personal space and cleanliness. The wife's actions are the initial problem, so the husband's response is a way to enforce boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
