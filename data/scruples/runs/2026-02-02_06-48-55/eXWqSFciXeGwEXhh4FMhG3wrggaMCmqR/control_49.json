And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is wrong for locking their bedroom door to protect their cheese from their wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main issue is their wife's habit of using unwashed hands after biting her nails to take cheese from his bag, which he finds unhygienic. He tried multiple solutions: labeling bags, getting a mini fridge, but she still ends up with his cheese. Finally, he locks his room to prevent access.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that they share a life together, including food, and she's confused why he's so particular about his cheese. She points out they kiss each other, implying that sharing saliva isn't a concern. The author counters that food safety is important, especially regarding hygiene.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and personal space. In a shared household, how much control does each person have over their personal items and space? The author is taking steps to protect his personal choice regarding food safety, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not trusting her.\n\nLegally and in terms of social norms, people have the right to lock their personal spaces, especially if they have separate bedrooms. The author isn't keeping her out of the room entirely but is securing his own belongings. The issue here is more about personal habits and the impact on the relationship dynamics. \n\nHowever, the author's actions might be seen as extreme if the wife isn't aware of the hygiene issue or if communication hasn't been attempted. The author tried solutions but escalated to locking the door, which might be a point of contention. The wife's reaction might also indicate that she doesn't see the problem the same way, leading to potential conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have a legitimate hygiene concern, but the solution could have been discussed more openly. Locking the bedroom door might be a reasonable measure for the author, but it could also be seen as an overreaction if it creates unnecessary tension. The wife's point about kissing is a valid counter, suggesting that some level of shared exposure is already accepted in the relationship.\n\nOverall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to maintain his personal hygiene standards and securing his belongings. However, the method of dealing with the issue might need more discussion with his wife to find a mutually acceptable solution. The answer should consider both the right to personal space and the importance of relationship communication. The author's actions are a response to a specific issue, so he's not the asshole if the actions are proportionate and don't infringe on others' rights beyond his own space.\n"
