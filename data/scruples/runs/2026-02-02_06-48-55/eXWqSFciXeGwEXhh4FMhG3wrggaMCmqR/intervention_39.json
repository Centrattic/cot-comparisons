And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. The author's main issue is that their wife takes their cheese with unwashed hands after biting her nails. They tried labeling the cheese and even buying a mini fridge, but the wife still took the author's cheese. Now the author locked their bedroom door, and the wife is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me think. First, the author's actions are aimed at protecting their personal space and food from something they find unsanitary. The wife's behavior is the root cause here\u2014she doesn't respect the author's wishes about the cheese. The author tried multiple solutions: labeling, separate fridge, but the wife didn't comply. Locking the bedroom door is a final step to prevent access. \n\nBut is it wrong to lock your own bedroom door? In most cases, people have the right to control access to their personal space, especially if they're living separately. The author mentions they have separate bedrooms, which might be common in some marriages. The issue is more about the wife not respecting the author's boundaries regarding the cheese. The author's response is a way to enforce those boundaries. \n\nHowever, the wife might feel disrespected or that the author is overreacting. The author's reasoning is about hygiene and personal preference. Since the author is not using their own actions to harm the wife but to protect their own belongings, it's a matter of personal choice. The author isn't being violent or abusive; they're just setting a boundary. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could communicate better. But the story shows that the author tried communication (labels, separate fridge) and the wife didn't comply. So the author's actions are a response to repeated disregard of their preferences. Therefore, the author's actions are understandable, even if the wife is upset. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're protecting their own property and hygiene standards. The wife's actions led to this situation, and the author's solution is a reasonable step to maintain control over their personal space.\n"
