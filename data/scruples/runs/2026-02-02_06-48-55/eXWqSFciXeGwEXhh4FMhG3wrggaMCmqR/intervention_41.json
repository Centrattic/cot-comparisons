And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's actions.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about personal space and boundaries versus the wife's actions. The author is frustrated because their wife takes their cheese after using her hands (which they consider contaminated) to handle it. They tried solutions like labeling and a mini fridge, but the wife still accessed it. Now, the author locks their room when away to prevent this.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're protecting their personal belongings and health concerns. They mention the cheese is ruined by her hands and they want to avoid germs. They also clarify it's not about money but about food safety. The wife shares a bedroom, but he moved the cheese to his own room, which he now locks.\n\nThe wife's side is that she shouldn't matter since they kiss, implying she doesn't see the issue with sharing food. The author's response is that personal hygiene matters, even in a relationship. They're trying to maintain cleanliness for their own peace of mind.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. They did take steps to solve the problem, but when those failed, they resorted to locking the room. Is that over the line? In a shared living situation, especially married, there's an expectation of shared spaces. Locking a bedroom door might be seen as creating a private area where the other person isn't supposed to enter. However, if the wife is sitting on the bed eating cheese that was placed there, maybe the author should have communicated more or found another solution.\n\nBut the author's intention is to protect their own items, which they have a right to. The wife's actions are the problem here\u2014taking without asking and ignoring boundaries. The author's final step is to lock the room, which is a reasonable measure if the wife isn't respecting their space or belongings. The wife might feel it's unreasonable, but the author has a legitimate concern about hygiene and personal property.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried multiple solutions, and locking their room is a final step to protect their own space. The wife's actions are the root issue here, not the author's defense of their property.\n"
