And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the husband installing a lock on his bedroom door to keep his wife from taking his cheese. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which he finds gross when she uses her hands in his cheese. He tried labeling the cheese bags, but she still took his. Then he bought a mini fridge in his bedroom, but she still came in and ate his cheese. So he locked the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid concern about hygiene. If someone with unwashed hands after biting their nails uses their fingers in food, that's definitely a hygiene issue. The wife's actions are causing him discomfort, and he's trying to protect his own food. On the other hand, the wife might feel that since they live together, sharing some things is normal, especially since they kiss and share other things.\n\nBut wait, the key here is that the husband is trying to prevent contamination, not just being picky. He's not the one sharing his food with her; he's just trying to keep his own separate. The wife, however, is taking his clearly labeled cheese, which he's put effort into separating. The fact that she didn't check the labels and took his bag is her fault. Then he goes to the mini fridge, which is in their shared home, but since they have separate bedrooms, maybe that's acceptable. But when she went into his room to eat his cheese, that's where it escalates. \n\nNow, installing a lock might seem extreme, but if the wife has been repeatedly accessing his private space without permission, locking the door could be a reasonable step to protect his belongings and his hygiene. The husband isn't keeping her out of their home; he's securing his own room. The wife's argument about kissing not mattering doesn't address the hygiene aspect of his cheese being contaminated. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband's response is overreacting. But given the repeated issues and the wife not respecting his efforts (like not checking labels, even after he tried to accommodate her), the lock might be a necessary step. So, the husband's actions are about protecting his own health and preferences, which are valid. The wife's actions are the ones that are causing the problem here. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He's taking reasonable steps to address a recurring issue that's affecting his personal hygiene and comfort. The answer should be B.\n"
