And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door and keeping it locked to prevent their wife from taking their cheese. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands properly. She uses the author's cheese without washing her hands after touching her mouth. The author tried labeling the cheese, but the wife ignored the labels. Then the author got a mini fridge in their bedroom, but the wife still found a way to take the cheese. Now the author locked their room to prevent access.\n\nThe author's main argument is about personal space and food safety. They want their cheese to be free from germs. The wife argues that they kiss, so it shouldn't matter. \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author is trying to maintain hygiene, which is understandable. But locking the bedroom door might be over the top. In a shared living space, some boundaries are normal, but complete isolation might affect the relationship. \n\nThe wife's actions are inconsiderate, but the author's solution of locking the room could be seen as extreme. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using separate storage in a common area but with clear labels. \n\nThe key points are consent and mutual respect. The author has the right to their own space, but creating a deadbolt might be an excessive measure that infringes on the wife's access without discussing it. The wife might feel disrespected if the author didn't talk to her first. \n\nHowever, the author's hygiene concerns are valid. If the wife isn't respecting the labels, maybe the author should communicate better. But since they've tried multiple steps and the problem persists, the deadbolt is a final solution. \n\nI think the author is justified in wanting their food to be clean, but the method used might be too harsh. The answer could be AITA depends on whether the action is reasonable. Since the author took it to an extreme without addressing the root issue, maybe they are in the wrong. However, there's also a valid point about personal boundaries. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because locking the bedroom door is a strong measure and they should have communicated better. But maybe not. It's a bit of a toss-up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
