And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the cheese story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who's upset because his wife is using his cheese without washing her hands. He goes through several steps to prevent her from accessing his cheese, including buying a separate fridge and eventually locking his bedroom door. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife's habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands is a concern for the husband. He's specific about wanting his cheese to be untouched by her hands after she's in her mouth. He tries labeling the cheese, then a mini fridge, and finally locks his room. The wife argues that they kiss all the time, so it shouldn't matter.\n\nFrom a personal boundaries perspective, the husband has a right to his own space and preferences. If he's uncomfortable with her handling his food in that way, it's reasonable for him to take steps to protect his personal belongings. However, the act of locking his bedroom door might be seen as an overreaction by some. But considering the repeated issues he's had\u2014like her ignoring labels and accessing his fridge even after the mini fridge\u2014it seems he's escalating to protect his personal space and hygiene.\n\nThe wife's argument about kissing might be a dismissal of his valid concerns. Just because they share bodily fluids during kissing doesn't mean he's okay with her hands in his food. Hygiene is subjective, and if he's particularly averse to it, his actions are his way of maintaining cleanliness.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that they are in a shared living situation, and expecting complete separation might not be reasonable. But the fact that they have separate bedrooms already suggests they have some level of privacy. The husband is just extending that privacy to his personal items, which isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's taking reasonable steps to protect his personal space and hygiene preferences. The wife could address the issue by either respecting his boundaries or discussing it if she feels they're too strict. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
