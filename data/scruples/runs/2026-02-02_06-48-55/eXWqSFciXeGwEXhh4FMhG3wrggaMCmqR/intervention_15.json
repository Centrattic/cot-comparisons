And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife. The author's main issue is that the wife uses their cheese after touching it with unwashed hands, which they find unhygienic. They took steps like buying separate fridges and even locking their bedroom door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's concern is about hygiene and personal boundaries with food. Food safety is a legitimate worry, especially if someone's hands aren't clean. The wife's behavior seems to be a recurring problem that the author has tried multiple times to address without success. The steps taken\u2014labeling, separate fridge, locking the door\u2014could be seen as reasonable measures to protect their own preferences, especially if it's not about money but about cleanliness and personal choice.\n\nHowever, installing a lock on the bedroom door might be seen as extreme. If they have separate bedrooms, the author might have a right to privacy and control over their own space. But the act of locking it could be perceived as cutting off shared access to a part of the house, which might affect the wife's freedom to move around. However, since the author is keeping the room locked when not present, it's more about protecting their personal items rather than excluding the wife entirely. \n\nThe wife's argument about kissing not being an issue might not address the specific concern about germs and food safety. The author is prioritizing their own health and hygiene, which is understandable. The key here is whether the measures taken are proportionate. Since the author has tried other solutions and the problem persists, locking the door could be a logical next step to enforce their boundaries regarding their own belongings. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the solution is over-the-top and could be causing unnecessary tension in the relationship. But given the persistence of the issue and the author's clear communication through labeling and separate storage, their actions seem justified. The author isn't preventing the wife from having cheese but is ensuring their own is kept according to their standards. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the context and the author's efforts to resolve the issue, their actions seem reasonable. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
