And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's habits. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife bites her nails and doesn't wash her hands, which the author finds gross. She takes his cheese with her unwashed hands, leading to contamination. The author buys separate bags, labels them, but she still ends up with his. Then he gets a mini fridge in his room, but she accesses it anyway. So he locks the door.\n\nNow, the question is about right and wrong. The key points here are shared living space and personal boundaries. The author is trying to protect his personal food, which is understandable. However, the response of locking the bedroom door might be seen as extreme, especially since they live together. Bedrooms are typically considered private, but if they have separate bedrooms, maybe the expectation is different. \n\nThe wife might feel that the author is being controlling or not respecting shared space. Even if the cheese is personal, the method of locking the door could be seen as overreacting. The author's main issue is about food safety, which is valid, but the solution might infringe on the wife's access to the room. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions are also problematic. Taking someone else's labeled food without permission is not okay. The author has a right to feel his food is being contaminated. But the lock might be a privacy issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have some fault. The wife shouldn't be taking labeled items, but the author's solution is restrictive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's protecting his own space and personal items, and the wife is not respecting boundaries, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut in terms of shared living, maybe the lock is an overreaction. It's a balance between personal hygiene and shared space etiquette. The author's actions are to protect his own health, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
