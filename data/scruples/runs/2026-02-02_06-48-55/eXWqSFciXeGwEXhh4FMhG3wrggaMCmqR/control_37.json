And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese safe from their wife's unwashed hands.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is annoyed because his wife takes his cheese, uses her unwashed hands after biting her nails, which he finds disgusting. He tried labeling the bags, but she didn't check the labels and took his cheese. Then he got a mini fridge in his separate bedroom, but she still took his cheese. Now he's locked the bedroom door. The wife is upset, but he's standing by his decision because of food safety.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and shared space. They live together, but they have separate bedrooms. He's trying to protect his personal food from contamination. The wife's actions are the initial problem, but the husband's solution is locking the bedroom door. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's taking steps to protect his own food. If the wife is eating from his private fridge without permission, maybe he's justified in locking it. On the other hand, they are a couple, and maybe there should be some compromise. But he's not stopping her from eating cheese; he's just keeping his own separate. \n\nThe labels didn't work, so he tried a mini fridge, which she bypassed. Now the lock is a logical next step. The wife might feel disrespected, but he's not being violent or harmful beyond protecting his property. The main issue is hygiene, which is a personal preference. The wife's actions are the problem, but he's responding to protect his own interests. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong. He's taking reasonable steps to protect his personal items from what he perceives as contamination. It's about personal choice and boundaries in a shared living situation.\n"
