And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who installed the lock on their bedroom door is at fault. The situation involves their wife taking his cheese after putting her fingers in her mouth, which he finds disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue here. The husband is upset because his wife contaminates his cheese by using her unwashed hands after biting her nails. He's tried solutions like buying separate bags and a mini fridge, but she still ends up taking his. Then he locks his door to prevent access. The wife is upset because they kiss, so she thinks it's fine, but he's concerned about hygiene.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, locking his own room seems like a reasonable step for him to protect his personal belongings, especially when he's expressed his discomfort. People have different standards of cleanliness. If he's particularly sensitive about germs, that's his right. But maybe there's a lack of communication. Did he talk to her about his feelings before taking the extreme step of a lock? Maybe he should have discussed it more, but the actions he took are to protect his own stuff. On the other hand, sharing a home means some compromises. However, given the specific issue isn't about money but about hygiene, and he's providing her with her own cheese, locking his room could be seen as his way of maintaining his personal space and health boundaries. So, maybe he's not in the wrong here. The answer might be B.\n"
