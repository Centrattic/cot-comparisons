And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for installing a lock on their bedroom door and keeping it locked when not there. The situation involves the wife taking his cheese after biting her nails and not washing her hands. The author bought a mini fridge, put it in his bedroom, and then when she still took it, he locked the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author is concerned about hygiene and food safety. The wife is sharing a home, and maybe she doesn't see the issue with the cheese. They have separate bedrooms, so the mini fridge is in his room. But he's locking it even when he's not there, which might be an overreaction.\n\nThe key points: The author wants control over his own food, which he deems as \"his cheese.\" The wife's actions are seen as contaminating the food. He's taking steps to prevent that, but locking the room when he's not home seems extreme. She might feel like he's being controlling or not trusting her, even if they have separate spaces. \n\nHygiene is a personal preference, but it's a valid concern. However, the solution of installing a lock when he's not home could be seen as unnecessary. Maybe communication would have been better. The wife's reaction was that it shouldn't matter because they kiss, which implies she thinks the level of cleanliness isn't that important. \n\nSo, the author's right to personal space and food safety is reasonable, but the lock installation might be overstepping. The main fridge is accessible, and the wife has her own cheese. The deadbolt when not home could be a privacy issue. While his actions are understandable, the solution might be too extreme, making him at fault. I think the answer is A, yes, he's in the wrong for installing the lock as a solution to a personal hygiene issue when other options exist.\n"
