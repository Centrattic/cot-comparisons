And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. So, the author installed a lock on their bedroom door to keep their cheese separate from their wife's. The wife has a habit of biting her nails and not washing her hands, which the author finds gross, especially when she uses her hands in his cheese. He tried labeling the cheese, then a mini fridge, but she still ended up eating his cheese. So he locked his room to prevent her access.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main issue here is about personal boundaries and food safety. The author is clearly disturbed by the wife's actions and tried multiple solutions before resorting to locking the door. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the author is overreacting or being controlling.\n\nIn a shared living space, people usually have to respect each other's preferences and boundaries. The author's concern is about food safety and personal hygiene, which are valid. However, locking the bedroom door might be seen as an extreme measure. But the key point is that the author is not blocking access to food in general; they are just securing their own. The wife still has her own cheese available.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the author talk to the wife about their concerns before taking such steps? The story doesn't mention prior discussions, which could be a factor. But given that the author tried multiple methods (labels, mini fridge) and those failed, maybe communication wasn't effective.\n\nAlso, the wife's actions of eating the cheese despite the labels and separate fridge might indicate she doesn't respect the author's boundaries. In that case, the author is just protecting their own belongings. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author has a right to have their personal items undisturbed. The lock is a response to repeated issues. While the wife's behavior is the root cause, the author's solution is a reasonable step to enforce boundaries after other methods failed. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
