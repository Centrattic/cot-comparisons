I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who refused to pay for a dinner at a friend's house is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast and charged attendees. The author thought it was ridiculous and rude to charge people, so they declined the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Usually, when someone hosts a dinner at their home, guests aren't expected to pay unless it's a specific event like a fundraiser or a paid dinner party. But the line can be blurry. The key points here are that the host is not in financial need, and the author found the charging aspect rude. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their choice to attend or not. If the host charges, then the guest can decide to pay or not attend. Since the author didn't attend, they aren't in the wrong for not paying. The host might feel offended, but the guest's right to choose is a factor here. \n\nHowever, maybe there's an expectation when you accept an invitation that you'll contribute in some way, but if the host explicitly states it's a paid event beforehand, then guests should be aware. The author declined before attending, so there's no issue of not paying after the fact. \n\nAnother angle: the author's perception of rudeness. If the host made it clear it's a paid event, then the author's refusal isn't about the host's actions but their own discomfort. The host might have had a reason, like covering costs or making a profit, but that doesn't necessarily make it right or wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for declining an invitation they found objectionable. They didn't attend, so there's no obligation to pay. The host's action of charging might be questionable, but the author's response is within their rights. The answer should be B (No).\n"
