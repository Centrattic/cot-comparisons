About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to at a friend's house.\n\nSo the situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged people to attend. The author initially agreed to go but changed their mind when they found out there was a charge. They turned down the invite with an excuse. The author isn't saying they can't afford it, just that they think charging is rude and the friend isn't in need of money. They also mention the friend made a profit from the event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around hosting events. Typically, when someone invites you to their home for a dinner, it's understood that they're hosting and covering the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a potluck or some kind of event where contributions are expected. However, if it's a private dinner, charging could be seen as a business transaction rather than a social gathering. \n\nThe author's reason for refusing is based on the principle that they shouldn't be charged for a social event. They find it rude and unnecessary since the friend isn't in financial need. The fact that the friend made a profit (40 pounds) adds another layer. If the event was more of a business venture, maybe the friend should have been explicit about that. \n\nBut from the friend's perspective, hosting a dinner with a charge could be their way of recouping costs or even making a profit. If they clearly communicated this before the event, perhaps the author's decision is their choice, but the author might have felt misled if the charge wasn't mentioned upfront. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't attend and didn't pay, but they didn't owe any money in the first place unless they agreed to contribute. If the friend charged everyone, then maybe the author was under the impression it was a free event. If the charge wasn't part of the original invitation, then the author had a right to back out. \n\nSocially, the friend might have overstepped by charging, especially if it's a casual gathering. So the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. They followed through on their decision to not attend when they found out about the charge. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about principle, not financial inability. That's a key point. People can choose not to attend events that don't align with their values, even if they can afford it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay if the charge wasn't communicated beforehand and if they found it inappropriate. The friend might have handled the situation differently by stating the charges upfront. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
