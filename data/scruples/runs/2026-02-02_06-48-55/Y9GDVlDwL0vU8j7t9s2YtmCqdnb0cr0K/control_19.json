I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were invited to a friend's Christmas roast dinner, but when they found out the friend was charging people to attend, they turned down the invite. The person argues that it's ridiculous and rude to charge guests for a dinner, especially since the friend isn't in financial need. They also mention the friend made a profit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone hosts a dinner, they cover the costs themselves, and guests aren't charged. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a paid event, which isn't common for private gatherings. The host here might have expected guests to pay for their share of the food and drinks, but that's not standard. So the person's refusal could be justified because the host shouldn't charge guests for a private dinner.\n\nBut maybe the host thought the group would split the costs to share the burden. If that's the case, the host might not have intended to make a profit but just cover expenses. However, the person in the story says the host made a profit of \u00a340, which complicates things. If the host is making money, that's more like running a business, which is different from a casual dinner. \n\nThe person's reasoning is that it's rude to charge for a private party. Socially, guests aren't expected to pay unless it's a specific event like a paid dinner party. So if the host is charging for a regular gathering, guests might feel it's unreasonable. The person in the story felt that way and declined the invitation, which is their right. They didn't cancel last minute or flake out; they just refused to attend once they found out about the charges. \n\nOn the other hand, if the host clearly communicated that there would be a contribution from guests before sending the invites, maybe the person should have known. But in this case, they received the invite and then found out about the charges later. The person might not have been aware upfront, so their refusal when they found out is a valid response. \n\nCharging guests can be seen as inconsiderate because the host should bear the cost of hosting. Making a profit is even worse because it's not a business event. The person's actions of declining the invitation when they found out the host was charging isn't in the wrong. They had the right to decline based on their discomfort with the host's decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably that the person isn't in the wrong. They didn't have to attend if they found the host's behavior unacceptable. So the answer should be B.\n"
