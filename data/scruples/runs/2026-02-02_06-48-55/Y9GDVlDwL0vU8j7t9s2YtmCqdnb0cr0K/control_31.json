I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who refused to pay for a dinner at a friend's house is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged people to attend. The author initially agreed to go but changed their mind when they found out about the charge, making an excuse to decline. They don't think they can't afford it, but they find it rude to charge guests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, it's common for hosts to cover the cost of a dinner, especially if it's a social gathering. Charging guests might be seen as unusual unless it's a formal event or a fundraiser. The host here made a profit of \u00a340, which might indicate they expected guests to contribute, but that's not typical for a casual dinner.\n\nThe key points are: the host invited people over and then charged them, which the author thinks is rude. The author's reasoning is that if you can't afford to host without charging, you shouldn't host. The friend isn't in financial need, so the charge isn't out of necessity. The author's refusal is based on principle, not inability to pay.\n\nIs the author wrong for declining? Well, when someone invites you to an event, you're expected to accept the terms of the invitation. If the host made it clear beforehand that there would be a charge, the author should have known. However, the host didn't mention the charge until after the author agreed to come. The author found out later and then backed out. The problem is whether the host should have disclosed the charge upfront. If they didn't, maybe the author had a right to decline upon learning that. Also, the author's stance is about being rude to charge friends, so their refusal is based on that belief. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the host didn't mention the charge in the initial invite, the author might not be wrong for changing their mind. However, if the host expected guests to know beforehand, the author might be in the wrong for not confirming. But since the host didn't disclose it until the author was already committed, the author's reaction is understandable. The host's action of charging might be the issue here, not the author's refusal. The author isn't obligated to pay unless it's a formal arrangement. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
