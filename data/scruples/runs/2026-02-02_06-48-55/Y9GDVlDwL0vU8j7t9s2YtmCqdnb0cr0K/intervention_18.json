About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was invited to a friend's Christmas dinner but refused to pay and thus declined the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around hosting events. Typically, when someone hosts a dinner at home, they cover the costs themselves. Charging guests is unusual unless it's a formal event like a restaurant. The friend here charged guests, and the author found that rude. The author didn't decline because of financial reasons but because they think it's inappropriate.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend isn't in need of money, so charging is unnecessary and rude. The friend made a profit, which adds to the author's frustration. The key points here are expectations of a host and the social contract of attending events. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for refusing to pay? If the invitation was presented without mentioning a charge, the author might have a point in feeling misled. However, once the charge was known, declining the invitation is a personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for declining because they were uncomfortable with the setup. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought the charge was reasonable, maybe to cover costs or for a specific purpose. But the author's refusal is based on a disagreement over social norms, not a breach of agreement. So, the author isn't wrong for choosing not to attend under those conditions. The answer is B (No).\n"
