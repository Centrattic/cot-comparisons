About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go.

I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and started charging people. The author thought it was ridiculous and rude, so they declined the invite. The friend isn't short on money, and the author saw that the friend made a profit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Traditionally, when someone hosts a dinner at home, guests don't pay for the meal unless it's a special event, like a paid dinner party. But sometimes, if the host is covering costs for everyone, especially if there are a lot of people, it might make sense. However, the key point here is that the host didn't mention the charge beforehand. The author only found out after agreeing to go and then backed out. That could be seen as the host not being upfront, which is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that it's rude to charge for a dinner invite. They might feel that hosting is the host's choice, and guests shouldn't have to pay. If the host didn't clarify that there's a cost involved before the author committed, maybe the author is justified in their refusal. The host's decision to charge could be seen as unexpected and perhaps inconsiderate, especially if the event isn't a formal or commercial one. However, the host is within their rights to charge if they choose, even if it's a private gathering.\n\nThe author is in a bit of a dilemma. They didn't back out because they couldn't afford it, which might mitigate some criticism. But they did back out after the fact, which could be seen as not being honest with the host. However, if the host didn't communicate the cost upfront, the author's reaction is more about the host's lack of transparency than their own wrongdoing. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The host's actions are questionable because they didn't set clear expectations. The author's refusal is a response to a situation that wasn't properly communicated, so they might not be at fault.\n"
