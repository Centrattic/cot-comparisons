About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to at a friend's house. The author declined the invitation when they found out the host was charging people. They argue it's rude to charge guests for a dinner, especially since the host isn't in financial trouble.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around hosting. Typically, when someone invites you to their home for a meal, it's understood that the host covers the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a paid event, like a dinner party where people contribute for expenses. However, expecting guests to pay could be seen as unexpected unless communicated upfront.\n\nThe author turned down the invite after learning about the charge. They made an excuse instead of confronting the host. Their reasoning is that it's rude and they don't think the host needed the money. The host made a profit, which adds to the author's frustration. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the host didn't mention the charge before the author committed, then the author might feel misled. However, declining an invitation because they don't agree with the host's decision isn't inherently wrong. The author's issue is with the payment aspect, not their ability to afford it. But maybe the host's approach was unorthodox, and the author's response was appropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the host had a valid reason, like wanting to recoup costs for a large gathering. If the host communicated the charge clearly from the start, the author could have declined politely. But since the author found out later, maybe they felt it was a breach of trust. However, the author's refusal to pay isn't necessarily wrong if they believe the host shouldn't charge in the first place. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The host's action might be unconventional, and the author's response is about personal ethics. Whether that makes them wrong depends on cultural norms and expectations. If the host didn't set clear expectations, both parties could have miscommunicated. But the author isn't obligated to pay for an invitation they didn't know had a fee. So, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
