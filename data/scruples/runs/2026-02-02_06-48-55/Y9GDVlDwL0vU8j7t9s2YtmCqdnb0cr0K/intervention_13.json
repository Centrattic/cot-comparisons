About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who refused to pay for a dinner they were invited to is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged guests. The author initially agreed to go but backed out when they found out about the charge. They felt it was rude to charge for a dinner and didn't want to pay, even though they could afford it. They also mentioned the friend made a profit.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending because of the charge. \n\nFrom the friend's perspective, hosting a dinner can have costs like food, drinks, etc. If the friend decided to charge guests to cover these expenses, maybe even make a small profit, that's their choice. The friend isn't poor, so it's not about needing the money. But charging guests might be seen as unexpected, especially if the invite didn't mention it. The author thought it was rude, which is a common reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had agreed to attend before knowing about the charge. Once they found out, they changed their mind. Friends usually don't charge each other for meals, so the friend might have expected a casual gathering without charges. \n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong for not attending. They had the right to decide not to go if they felt uncomfortable with being charged. However, maybe they could have communicated better. Instead of making an excuse, maybe they could have asked the friend why he was charging or expressed their discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are: was the friend's action of charging guests acceptable, and was the author justified in refusing to attend? If the friend's action was considered rude or unexpected, then the author's refusal isn't the issue. But if the friend had a right to charge guests (like splitting costs), then the author might be in the wrong for not contributing. \n\nBut since the friend isn't in need and it's a social gathering, expecting guests to pay might not be standard. So the author's stance is more about differing opinions on social norms. The author isn't wrong for not attending because they found the charge unacceptable. They might not be responsible for paying if it's part of a social event. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they had the right to decline based on their personal beliefs about social gatherings and charges.\n"
