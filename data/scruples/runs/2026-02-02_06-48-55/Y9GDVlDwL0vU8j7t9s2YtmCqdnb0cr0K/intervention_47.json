About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The author's friend hosted a Christmas roast, charged people to attend, and the author declined because they found it rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, when someone invites you to a dinner at their home, it's expected to be a friendly gesture without charging guests. Charging might be unusual unless it's a formal event or fundraiser. The author's reasoning is that it's rude to charge friends, which makes sense because friends usually don't expect to pay for each other's events. \n\nThe author mentions their friend isn't short on money, so it's not about covering costs. The friend made a profit, which adds to the unlikelihood of needing to charge. The author's refusal is based on the principle that friends shouldn't be charged for social gatherings. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're standing by their belief that charging friends is inappropriate. However, maybe the host had a different intention, like a themed party where contributions are part of the experience. But the author's main point is about rudeness, not ability to pay.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the host clearly stated it's a paid event, the author could have declined without an excuse. But the author made an excuse, which might indicate they felt awkward. If the host didn't mention the charge beforehand, the author's reaction is more understandable. \n\nThe key is whether the host communicated the charges upfront. If the invite was conditional on payment, the author's refusal is justified. If not, maybe the host should have been clearer. The author's stance is about principle, so unless there's a cultural expectation I'm missing, they're probably not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
