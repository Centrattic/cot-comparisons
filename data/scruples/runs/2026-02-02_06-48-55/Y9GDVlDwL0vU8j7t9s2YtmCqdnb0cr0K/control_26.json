About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who refused to pay for a dinner they were invited to is in the wrong. The scenario is a friend hosting a Christmas roast dinner and charging guests. The person in question turned down the invite because they found it ridiculous to charge for a dinner, even though they could afford it. They think it's rude and their friend isn't in need of money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around hosting events. Generally, when someone hosts a dinner, it's expected that the host covers the costs. Charging guests isn't typical unless it's a paid event, which is usually communicated upfront. So if the host didn't mention the cost beforehand, the guest might not have accepted if they knew. But in this case, the person found out about the charge and then decided not to go.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that it's rude to charge when the host isn't in need. But maybe the host had different reasons\u2014maybe they wanted to cover expenses, especially if they were making a profit. The guest's action was to decline the invite, not to confront or cause conflict. They didn't go, so maybe they didn't wrong the host directly. However, some might argue that declining after accepting could be seen as inconsiderate, but the key point is the charge itself.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to pay unless it's a contract, but socially, there's an expectation of reciprocity. However, if the host is charging, it's more like a paid event. The guest's refusal is a personal choice based on their values. Since they didn't go, they didn't break any rules, just followed their principles. The host might be upset about losing a guest, but the guest isn't in the wrong for not attending something they find unreasonable.\n"
