      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to at their friend's house. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged the attendees. The author initially agreed to go but changed their mind when they found out about the charge. They turned down the invite with an excuse, not because they couldn't afford it, but because they found it rude to charge for a dinner. They also mention that the host made a profit, which adds another layer to the situation.\n\nThe key points here are whether it's reasonable to charge guests at a dinner party and whether refusing to pay was justified. Let's start with the host's actions. Charging guests for a dinner party can be a gray area. If it's a casual get-together among friends, it's usually expected that the host covers the costs, maybe splitting expenses if it's a larger group. However, if the host is making a profit, that might imply it's more of a business or event, which could change expectations. The author mentions the host made a 40-pound profit, which suggests that the dinner wasn't just a simple meal but perhaps a more formal event where the host intended to make money. In that case, charging guests might be acceptable, especially if it was communicated beforehand. \n\nBut the author didn't know about the charge until after agreeing to attend. That's a big point. If the host didn't mention the charge upfront, that could be seen as misleading. The author's decision to back out after finding out might be justified if the charge was unexpected. However, if the host was clear from the start, the author's refusal could be considered polite but not necessarily wrong.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning: They find it rude to charge guests. In many social circles, it's considered impolite to charge friends for a dinner unless it's a special event or the host is hosting as a business. If the host is friends with everyone and just hosting a meal, charging might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the host is making a profit, maybe they're hosting an event that's more like a supper club or similar, which could be different. The line between a social gathering and a business venture is important here.\n\nThe author's actions: They refused to attend after finding out about the charge. They didn't have to pay, but they also backed out of the event. If the host had communicated the charge upfront, the author could have declined the invite without attending. But since they found out after agreeing, maybe the author's reaction is understandable. However, backing out at the last minute might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the host had already planned for their attendance. \n\nAnother angle: The author is not in the wrong if they believe that charging friends for a dinner is unacceptable. They might have felt that the host's actions crossed a social boundary. On the other hand, if the host was transparent and the charge was part of the event's structure, the author might be overstepping by refusing to pay once they agreed to attend.\n\nAlso, the fact that the host made a profit could imply that the dinner was more of a paid event. In such cases, charging guests might be standard, but if it's presented as a social gathering among friends, it's inappropriate to charge. The author's confusion here might stem from the host not being clear about the event's nature.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, if you invite someone to your home for dinner, charging them isn't customary unless it's a formal event. The host might have miscalculated the event's nature. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for social norms, but it's also possible that the host had a different intention. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the host's intentions and communication. If the host didn't mention the charge beforehand, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out. However, if the charge was part of the event's structure and the host was clear, the author's refusal might be seen as unreasonable. But given that the charge wasn't mentioned until after the author agreed to attend, and the host made a profit, it seems the host might have mismanaged expectations. Therefore, the author's stance could be justified.\n"
