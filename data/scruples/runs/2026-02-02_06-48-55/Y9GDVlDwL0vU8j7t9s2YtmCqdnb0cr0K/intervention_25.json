About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas dinner and charged people, so the author declined the invite when they found out about the charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around hosting. Typically, when someone invites you to dinner, the host covers the cost. But in some cases, maybe people chip in for the food. However, the key here is that the host was charging people. The author refused to pay, so they turned down the invite. \n\nThe author argues it's rude to charge guests. They say their friend isn't in need of money, so the charge is just unnecessary. The friend might have had reasons, like splitting costs if it's a big event, but the author thinks it's unreasonable. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural expectations. In some cultures, it's expected that the host covers everything, and guests don't pay. If the host is charging, the author's refusal could be seen as justified. However, maybe the host expected guests to contribute, especially if the event is large. If the author knew in advance about the charges, maybe they should have clarified. But the friend made an excuse after finding out about the charges. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's rude to charge guests. If the host didn't mention the charges upfront, maybe the author is right to refuse. But if the host did mention it beforehand, the author should have decided then. Since the author turned down after the fact, maybe they should have been more direct earlier. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the profit made. If the host is making money, that could be a red flag. Hosting a dinner for profit isn't typical, so the author's refusal might be reasonable. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, guests usually don't pay unless it's a formal event. So the host charging might be the issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for declining once they found out. So the answer would be B.\n"
