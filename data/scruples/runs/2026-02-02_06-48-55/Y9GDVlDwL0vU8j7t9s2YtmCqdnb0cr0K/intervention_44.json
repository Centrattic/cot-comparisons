About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to at a friend's house. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged guests, and the author declined the invite because they found it ridiculous and rude to charge for the dinner. The author isn't broke but thinks it's wrong to charge friends for attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Traditionally, when you invite friends over for a meal, especially a holiday dinner, it's usually considered the host's responsibility to cover the costs. Charging guests might be seen as unusual unless it's a formal event or a paid gathering. The host in this case might have expected guests to either bring a dish or contribute in another way, but charging for the meal itself could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's rude to charge friends, and they think the host made a profit. If the dinner was a genuine social event, charging for food might not be expected. However, if the host had some kind of business or themed event where guests pay for a meal, that's different. But since the host isn't short on money, it seems more like a personal choice to charge friends, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nNow, the author decided not to attend because of this, which could be seen as being inconsiderate to the host's wishes. However, the host's decision to charge guests might also be questionable. The question is whether the author was wrong to refuse. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, if the host clearly states that there's a charge, guests should respect that unless they can't afford it. But if the host invited people without mentioning the charge beforehand, maybe it's the host's fault. However, the author could have asked about the cost initially or discussed it if they were uncomfortable. Instead, they made an excuse to decline, which might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than addressing it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's stance is that charging for a social event is rude. If the host's intention was to make money, that might not be a social gathering but a business venture, which should be communicated upfront. If the host didn't clarify, the author might be justified in their refusal.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the host's actions were reasonable. If the host charged without prior notice, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the host was clear, then the author should have attended or communicated their discomfort earlier. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides.\n"
