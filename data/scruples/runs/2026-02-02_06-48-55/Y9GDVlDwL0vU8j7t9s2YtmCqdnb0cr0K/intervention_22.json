I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged attendees. The author thinks it's rude to charge guests for a dinner at a friend's house and decided not to attend, making an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you to a dinner at their home, it's understood that they're covering the costs as part of the hospitality. Charging guests isn't common and might be seen as unusual. However, if the host is contributing significantly (like buying expensive food), some might argue that splitting costs is fair, especially if the group is large.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they find it ridiculous and rude to charge friends. They mention that the host isn't short on money, which adds another layer. The author's decision to decline the invite based on this policy might be seen as a personal choice, but could come off as judgmental or dismissive of the host's approach.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: hosting events can be costly, and splitting costs might be a way to share the burden. However, if the host is charging a price that's higher than the actual cost (like making a profit), that could be an issue. The user mentions a 40-pound profit, which might be seen as turning a social event into a money-making venture, which could be off-putting.\n\nThe key points here are: Is charging guests for a social dinner at home socially acceptable? Did the author overreact by refusing to attend? Or is the host in the wrong for expecting payment for a personal event?\n\nIn many cultures, when you host a dinner at home, it's considered a personal gesture, not a service. Charging might be seen as uninviting. However, in some contexts, splitting costs for large groups or expensive events is common. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for what they believe is right in social etiquette, but it might also be viewed as being overly rigid or judgmental.\n\nThe host's profit aspect is a red flag. If the host is charging more than the actual cost, it's not just covering expenses but making money, which could be perceived as a business rather than a friendly gathering. The author's stance might be justified here if the host is exploiting the event for personal gain.\n\nSo, the author's perspective is that charging friends for a dinner is rude and unnecessary. Their refusal is based on this belief. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether charging guests in this context is considered acceptable. Since there's no clear consensus, but the host's profit motive might tip the scales, the author's position could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
