I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged people to attend. The author of the post declined the invite when they found out there was a charge. They argue that it's rude to charge guests for a dinner at a friend's house, especially since the host isn't in need of money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Normally, when you invite someone to your home for dinner, it's understood that you're the host covering the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a formal event or a potluck where people contribute. The host here might have expected guests to chip in for expenses, but that's not a common practice in most social circles. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their belief that the host should cover the costs, but maybe they overreacted.\n\nNext, the reason given is that the host isn't short on money. The author finds it ridiculous to charge when the host can afford it. That adds to the argument that the host's action is unnecessary. However, the author didn't attend, so there's no direct conflict. The question is whether refusing to pay is a valid response. If the invitation was free and the host just expected payment, the guest is under no obligation to pay. The author's stance is that they don't owe money for an event they didn't attend, so they're not in the wrong for declining.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the host made a profit. Charging guests to the point of making profit might be crossing a line, more like a business than a social gathering. That could justify the author's reaction. But if the host is just covering costs, maybe the situation is different. However, since the host made a profit, it's more about charging guests for something they wouldn't typically be charged.\n\nAnother angle: was there prior communication about the cost? If the host mentioned it beforehand, the author could have decided to attend regardless or not. But the author only found out later, which might make the host not entirely at fault for not being up front. Still, the author's decision to decline is their right. They aren't obligated to pay for an event they didn't attend, especially if they disagree with the host's approach.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, charging friends for a dinner party is unconventional. The author's refusal is a personal choice based on their values. Since they didn't attend, there's no direct harm done. The host might be upset, but the author isn't wrong for choosing not to participate in a way that goes against their beliefs. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
