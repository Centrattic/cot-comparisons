About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote an AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The scenario is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast, invited people over, but then charged them. The author of the post decided not to go because they thought it was ridiculous and rude to charge guests. They mention the friend isn't short on money and that they saw pictures of the food, implying the friend made a profit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around hosting. Traditionally, when someone invites you to their home for a meal, especially a social event like a roast, it's customary for the host to cover the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a paid event, like a dinner party where people pay to attend. However, in most casual settings, expecting guests to pay isn't standard. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's rude for the host to charge. They also mention that the host made a profit, which adds another layer. If the host is making money from the dinner, that might cross into something like a business activity, which is different from a social gathering. But the host might not have intended it as a business venture, just a way to cover costs or make some extra money.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of both the host and the guests. If the host didn't mention the fee beforehand, that could be a problem because guests might assume it's free. The author's decision to decline based on the fee could be seen as a valid choice since it's their right to accept or decline invitations based on their comfort. \n\nHowever, from the host's perspective, if they invested time and money to prepare the dinner, expecting guests to contribute could be understandable, especially if they expected a larger turnout. But charging guests might still be considered unusual unless it was a formal event where payment was a condition of attendance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't break any rules by declining the invitation. The issue is whether the host was in the wrong by charging. The author's refusal isn't inherently wrong; they have the right to decline. However, if the host had a legitimate expectation that guests would contribute, then the author might be seen as not honoring the social contract. But given that the host is described as not needing the money and the author's stance on it being rude, the author's position seems reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for declining, especially since the host's approach was unconventional. The answer would be B, meaning they are not in the wrong.\n"
