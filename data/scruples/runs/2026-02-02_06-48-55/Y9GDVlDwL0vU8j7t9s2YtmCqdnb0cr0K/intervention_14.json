About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The scenario is that the author's friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and started charging guests. The author declined the invite when they found out about the charge, even though they can afford it. The author thinks it's rude and unreasonable to charge for a dinner, especially since the host isn't in financial need.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you to their home for a meal, it's understood that they're covering the costs. Charging guests could be seen as unusual, but maybe the host had a valid reason. The author's friend might be hosting a dinner as a social event, and perhaps they're splitting costs because there are a lot of people, or maybe it's a potluck where everyone contributes. However, the host explicitly states they made a profit, which makes it more about generating income rather than sharing costs.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on the belief that it's rude to charge for a social gathering. But if the host is charging, maybe they communicated that upfront. If the host didn't mention the charge in the original invite, that's a problem. However, the author only agreed until they found out about the charge. If the charge was a surprise, the author's reaction might be justified. But if the host did mention the charge beforehand, the author should have known.\n\nAnother angle is the host's intention. If the host is making a profit, that's like a business activity, not a casual dinner. The author might feel that the host is exploiting the event for personal gain. However, the host might argue they're covering costs and contributing to the event. The key here is whether the charge was part of the original invitation. If it wasn't mentioned, the author's refusal is understandable. But if the charge was part of the invite and the author agreed, then their refusal could be seen as breaking an agreement.\n\nSocial expectations vary. In some cultures, splitting costs is common for large events. If the host expects everyone to chip in, that's different from charging for a personal dinner. The author's stance is that it's rude, but others might see it as a way to share expenses. However, the host making a profit (40 pounds) does cross into monetizing a social event, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's refusal might be justified if the charge was unexpected and the host is profiting.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the host didn't mention the charge upfront and the event was for profit, the author's refusal makes sense. However, if the host clearly communicated the charges and the author agreed, then declining might be seen as inconsiderate. Based on the information given, the author's reasoning is valid, but there's a nuance in whether the charge was part of the original invitation.\n"
