About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The situation is a Christmas roast dinner hosted by a friend, which ended up being a paid event. The author declined the invite after finding out about the charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around hosting. Typically, when someone invites you to their home for dinner, it's understood that they're covering the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a formal event like a dinner party with a specific fee. The author thinks it's rude to charge, especially since the host isn't in need. Others might see it as the host's choice, maybe to cover expenses or even make a profit. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's unfair and rude. They could afford it, but the principle is the issue. The host made a profit of \u00a340, which might mean the event wasn't just covering costs. The question is whether the author was wrong to back out.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to pay unless it's a contract, which isn't the case here. Socially, it's about expectations. If the invite was clear about the charge from the start, the author might be at fault for not agreeing. However, the host didn't mention the charge upfront. The author found out later and declined. That's where the conflict lies. \n\nCultural context matters. In some places, charging friends for a dinner might be seen as a business venture, which changes the dynamic. The author's stance is that it's not their responsibility to pay when it's a social gathering. Others might argue that if the host chooses to run it as a paid event, guests should comply if they want to attend. \n\nThe key points are the host's clear communication and the guest's right to accept or decline. Since the host didn't mention the charge initially, the author had the right to decide after the fact. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for declining based on the information they had at the time they accepted the invite. The host's approach might be questionable, but the guest's decision isn't in the wrong.\n"
