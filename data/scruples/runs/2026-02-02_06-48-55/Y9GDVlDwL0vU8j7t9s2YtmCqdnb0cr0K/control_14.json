About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go.

I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying for a dinner they were invited to. The situation is that their friend hosted a Christmas roast and charged people to attend. The author thought it was ridiculous and rude to charge guests, so they declined the invite. They mention that the friend isn't short on money and that the friend made a profit from the event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you to their home for a meal, it's expected that you don't pay unless it's a potluck or some kind of organized event where contributions are expected. However, some people might charge for events to cover costs, like if they're hosting a larger group or have expenses. In this case, the friend charged people, and the author felt it was unreasonable.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that charging guests is rude, especially when the host isn't in need of money. They also point out that the host made a profit, which might imply that the charges were more than the cost of the meal. So, the author's refusal is based on the principle that guests shouldn't be charged for a social event, especially when the host can afford to cover the costs.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the friend made it clear that there would be a charge when extending the invite, then the author could have accepted or declined. But the author says they were invited first and then found out about the charge later. If the charge was not mentioned upfront, that might be an issue. However, the author had the choice to attend and pay or decline. Since they chose not to attend, they aren't in the wrong for not paying. The friend might be in the wrong for not being clear about the charge beforehand, but that's not the author's responsibility.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that once you accept the invite, you should follow through even if there's a charge. But the author didn't accept the invite after knowing about the charge. They turned it down because of that. So they aren't obligated to pay. The key point is whether the charge was reasonable and if the friend was upfront about it. Since the author felt it was unreasonable and the friend wasn't in need, their decision to decline makes sense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
