About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who refused to pay for a dinner hosted by a friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the host charged guests for the dinner, and the author declined the invitation when they found out about the charge. The author argues that it's rude to charge friends for a social gathering, especially since the host isn't in need of money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many social settings, when someone hosts a dinner, especially a casual or friendly event like a Christmas roast, it's generally expected that the host covers the costs. Charging guests could be seen as unusual or even impolite. However, if the event is more of a potluck or if contributions are expected, that's different. But the key here is that the author was informed after accepting the invitation. If the host didn't mention the charge upfront, that's a problem. The author might feel misled, which justifies their refusal.\n\nOn the other hand, if the host clearly stated before the event that there would be a charge, then the author might have accepted or declined based on that. But since the author mentions they turned it down after hearing about the charge, it implies the host didn't communicate this beforehand. That could be a breach of etiquette, as guests should know the expectations in advance.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's rude to charge friends, which is a valid perspective. Social gatherings, especially among friends, are typically about the company and not a business transaction. The fact that the host made a profit might add to the perception that it's more of a commercial event, which could clash with the intended social purpose.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that if the host chose to charge, even among friends, the guests should respect that decision. But given the context of a Christmas dinner, which is usually a festive and generous event, charging guests might be seen as out of place. The author's refusal is based on their belief that the host's action was inappropriate, which is a reasonable stance given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all angles, it seems the host might have been in the wrong for not being upfront about the charges. The author's refusal, while possibly not the most diplomatic approach, is understandable given the breach of social norms. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
