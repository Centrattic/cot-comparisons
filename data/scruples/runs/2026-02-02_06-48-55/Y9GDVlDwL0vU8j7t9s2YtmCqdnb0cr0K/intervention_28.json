About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who declined to pay for a dinner is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged guests. The author thought it was rude to charge for a dinner at someone's home, even though they can afford it. They turned down the invite with an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, when someone hosts a dinner at their home, it's expected that the host covers the costs. Charging guests might be seen as unusual unless it's a paid event like a restaurant. However, some people might argue that splitting costs is fair, especially if the group is large. But the key here is the context of a private dinner, not a formal event. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's rude to charge friends for a meal. That's a common perspective, but others might see it as the host's way to manage expenses. The author didn't attend but didn't confront the friend, just made an excuse. They also mention the host made a profit, which adds a layer of unfairness if the host was using the dinner for financial gain.\n\nIs refusing to pay justifiable? If the invitation was clear about the cost, the author could have declined upfront. However, the friend didn't mention the charge initially, leading the author to believe it was a free event. The author's refusal is based on the principle that friends shouldn't charge each other for such gatherings. \n\nBut legally and socially, if the host chose to charge, guests aren't obligated to pay unless they agreed. However, declining the invitation isn't wrong. The real issue is the friend charging for a private dinner, which might be the host's mistake for not clarifying upfront. The author's stance is about social norms, but their action (not attending) isn't the problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the host didn't disclose the charge beforehand, the author's decision to decline makes sense. The host's approach might be the issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend when they found out there was a charge they found unreasonable.\n"
