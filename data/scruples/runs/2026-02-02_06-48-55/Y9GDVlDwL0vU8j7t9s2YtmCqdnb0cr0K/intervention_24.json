About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to. The scenario is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged people. The author thought it was ridiculous and rude to charge guests, so they declined the invitation with an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Normally, when someone invites you to a dinner at their home, especially a friend, they cover the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a paid event. The author's friend might have had a reason, like covering expenses or making a profit, but the author found it rude. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't think it's acceptable to charge friends for a dinner. They mention the friend isn't in financial need. The key points here are whether charging guests is considered rude in this context and if the author was obligated to pay. \n\nIf the invitation was presented as a social gathering without prior mention of a charge, then the friend might have breached social etiquette by expecting payment. The author declining could be seen as standing by their belief that such a practice is inappropriate. On the other hand, the friend might have expected guests to contribute, perhaps to split costs. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if the friend didn't communicate the charge upfront. However, if the charge was part of the initial invitation, the author might be expected to comply. Since the author turned it down after learning about the charge, it's more about differing expectations. \n\nIn many social circles, expecting payment for a dinner party is uncommon. The author's refusal might be justified if they felt it was an unwelcome imposition. The friend's profit (40 pounds) could be a point against them, suggesting it's more of a business than a social event. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They had the right to decline if they felt the charge was inappropriate. However, the answer depends on cultural norms and the friend's communication. If the charge was unexpected and not discussed beforehand, the author's reaction is reasonable.\n"
