I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who refused to pay for a dinner at a friend's house is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged attendees. The author thought it was rude to charge guests and turned down the invite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around hosting events. Typically, when someone hosts a dinner at their home, it's expected that they cover the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a formal event or there's a specific reason. The friend here seems to have made money (40 pounds profit), which raises questions about whether this was a legitimate dinner or more of a business venture.\n\nThe author didn't attend, which is their choice, but the question is if refusing to pay made them wrong. Since the friend is charging for a social gathering, some might see this as inappropriate. The author's refusal to pay is a rejection of that practice, which others might side with, especially if they agree that hosts shouldn't charge guests for a dinner party.\n\nHowever, if the friend made it clear beforehand that there was a charge, then guests have the choice to attend or not. The author made a choice not to attend, so they aren't necessarily wrong for not paying because they didn't participate. The issue here is more about the host's decision to charge rather than the guest's refusal to pay.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the host isn't short on money, which could imply that the charge wasn't about covering costs but making a profit. This could be seen as taking advantage of the guests under the guise of a social event. The author's stance against this might be justified in the eyes of many.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't attend, so there's no direct wrongdoing in refusing to pay. The host's action of charging might be the actual issue here. The author is not obligated to pay if they didn't agree to it. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because they chose not to attend when they found out about the charges, which they found unacceptable.\n"
