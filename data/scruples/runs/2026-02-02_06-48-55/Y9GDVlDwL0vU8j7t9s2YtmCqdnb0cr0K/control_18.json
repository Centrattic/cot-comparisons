About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go.

I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for a dinner they were invited to at a friend's house. So, the situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast dinner and charged people to attend. The author initially agreed to go but backed out when they found out about the charge. They mention that it's not about not being able to afford it, but that they find it rude to charge guests. The friend isn't short on money either. The author also calculated that the host made a profit of around 40 pounds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when you're invited to someone's home for dinner, it's expected that the host covers the costs. Charging guests could be seen as unusual or unexpected. The author's reasoning is that it's rude to charge, which is subjective, but many people might agree that it's not customary. So if the host is making a profit, that might be seen as monetizing a social event, which could be off-putting.\n\nHowever, the host is allowed to set the terms of their own event. If the invitation was conditional on payment, then the author might have agreed to pay if they had known. The problem here is that the author found out about the charge after agreeing to attend. But if the host didn't mention the charge upfront, maybe that's an issue. The author's refusal is based on the principle that you shouldn't charge guests, but the host's perspective is that they're organizing an event and covering costs, perhaps even making a profit.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the host didn't disclose the charge before the author agreed to come, then maybe the host is at fault for not being upfront. But if the charge was part of the invite, then the author might have declined from the start. Since the author did agree to go before knowing, and then backed out, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's stance is about social etiquette, which is a common viewpoint. People often don't expect to pay to attend a friend's dinner. So the author's refusal might be justified. The host could be seen as overstepping by charging guests, especially if it's a profit-making venture. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
