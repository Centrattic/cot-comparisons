I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who refused to pay for a dinner they were invited to is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend hosted a Christmas roast and charged guests. The author decided not to go because they found it rude to charge for a dinner at someone's home, even though they can afford it. They mention the friend isn't in financial need and that they saw pictures of the food implying a profit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, hosting a dinner at home typically doesn't involve charging guests. It's usually seen as a gesture of hospitality. Charging might be unusual unless it's a paid event or fundraiser. The author's reasoning is that it's rude, which aligns with common social expectations. \n\nThen there's the question of consent and agreement. The invitation didn't mention a fee, so the guest might not have agreed to pay. The host's action of charging after the invitation could be seen as a bait and switch. The author's refusal is based on the principle that the host shouldn't profit from a social gathering. \n\nAnother angle is whether the host had a right to charge. If the host planned the event with the intention of making money, maybe they should have communicated that upfront. The author's excuse for not attending is about the principle of the matter, not the cost. They can afford it, but the act of being charged is the issue.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the host put a lot of effort and money into the dinner, charging guests is fair. But in typical social settings, this isn't standard. It's more like a restaurant or event with fees. If the host is making a profit, maybe it's a business, not a social event. \n\nThe author isn't inconsiderate; they're standing by their belief about social norms. The host's action could be seen as inconsiderate for not clarifying the costs beforehand. The author's response of declining is a personal choice based on their values, not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The host's actions might be questionable, but the author's refusal is justified by their stance on social etiquette.\n"
