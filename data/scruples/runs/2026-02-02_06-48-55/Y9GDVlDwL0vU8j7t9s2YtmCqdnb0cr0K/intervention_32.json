About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author declined a dinner invitation because the friend charged people to attend. The author thinks it's rude to charge guests, even though they can afford it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around hosting events. Typically, when someone hosts a dinner at home, especially a casual gathering like a Christmas roast, it's expected that the host covers the costs. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a paid event or a fundraiser. The friend in this case made a profit, which seems odd for a private dinner.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that charging guests is rude. They didn't attend because of that. But is the author wrong for declining? Well, they didn't attend, so maybe there's no direct conflict. However, if they had committed to going and then backed out because of the charge, that could be seen as being inconsiderate. But in this case, the author turned it down initially when they found out about the charge. \n\nFriendships involve mutual respect and understanding. The friend might have had a reason to charge, maybe to cover costs or for a specific purpose. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as a disagreement with the friend's approach. However, the friend isn't necessarily wrong for charging, and the author isn't wrong for finding it rude. It's more about differing opinions on what's acceptable in social settings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend decided to charge and the author didn't like it, but the author didn't attend, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set their own boundaries. On the other hand, if the author had agreed to attend and then left because of the charge, that might be different. But here, the author just declined the invite. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they made a choice based on their values and didn't attend. But some might argue that declining after accepting could be inconsiderate, but the post says they turned it down initially. So the author isn't in the wrong for declining an invitation they found unacceptable.\n"
