I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who refused to pay for a dinner hosted by a friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend charged guests for the Christmas roast dinner, and the author declined the invite when they found out about the charge.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about social expectations. In many cultures, when someone hosts a dinner at their home, it's common for the host to cover the costs as part of the invitation. Charging guests might be unusual unless it's a paid event. The author thinks it's rude to charge friends, and the host isn't in financial need. The author isn't in a position where they can't afford it, but they find the practice unreasonable. The host made a profit, which adds another layer\u2014maybe the host was using the event as a way to make money, which the author finds off-putting.\n\nNow, considering social norms, if someone invites you over and it's a private gathering, expecting payment is out of the ordinary. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for what they believe is a social norm. However, if the host had communicated the cost upfront, maybe the author would have still attended but with the understanding. The author's main issue is the principle of being charged for a friend's dinner. The host's profit motive might not be transparent to the guests, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't attend, which is their right. They didn't pay, which they weren't obligated to if they declined. The host might argue that since they invited people, they expected payment, but the guests aren't obligated to accept the terms. The author's stance is based on social etiquette, so they're not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
