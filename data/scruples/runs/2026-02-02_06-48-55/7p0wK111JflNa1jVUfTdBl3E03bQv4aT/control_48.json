(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The question is about whether it's her fault for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned that they had talked about their likes and dislikes beforehand, and she made it clear she didn't like it when he was too gentle or passionate. She has a history of an abusive relationship, and she finds that rough sex helps her let go, while gentle, emotional sex makes her uncomfortable.\n\nHer boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, and when she said she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad and left, then hasn't responded to his messages. The user is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider communication. She told him her preferences beforehand. That's important because good communication is key in relationships. If she already expressed her needs, then he should have respected that. But when she told him to stop again during the interaction, maybe he wasn't listening properly. The boyfriend's actions after she told him to stop might be an issue. If he kept trying things even after she said she didn't like it, that's a problem. \n\nHer reaction: getting mad and leaving. In a healthy relationship, expressing discomfort is okay. She didn't stay and talk it out, though. Leaving might be seen as avoiding conflict, but given her past abuse, her sensitivity is valid. However, not responding to his messages could be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions: if he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, maybe he misunderstood what she meant by her preferences. But she had already specified her dislikes, so he should adjust. If he was trying to be gentle because of his own preferences or assumptions, but she had clearly communicated otherwise, then he should have followed her lead. However, if he thought he was being responsive and she suddenly changed her mind, that might complicate things. \n\nThere's also the aspect of her past trauma. Her history with abuse might make her react strongly to certain behaviors. It's important to acknowledge that trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. If he's aware of her history, he might need to be careful. But if he's not, he might not realize the impact of his actions. \n\nIn terms of consent and communication, she has the right to express her boundaries. If he continued after she told him to stop, that's a violation. But if he stopped immediately and tried other things, maybe his intention was good but the execution was off. \n\nThe fact that she left and hasn't responded could be seen as her not taking responsibility for her part in the conflict. Maybe she could have explained her feelings more clearly instead of just leaving. However, given her discomfort, maybe that's her way of handling the situation. \n\nOverall, considering she communicated her preferences, and if he didn't heed her boundaries, she's not in the wrong for getting upset. But not addressing the issue might have made things worse. The answer probably leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because she had communicated her needs and reacted to his not respecting them. But there's also a nuance where communication could be improved from both sides.\n"
