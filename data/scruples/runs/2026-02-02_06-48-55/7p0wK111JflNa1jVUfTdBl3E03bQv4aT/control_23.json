(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21-year-old woman who's upset her boyfriend is being too gentle during sex. They talked about their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. Now, when he tried to be gentle, she got mad and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did communicate her boundaries to him, which is good. But maybe he misunderstood what she meant. When he said he wanted \"normal\" sex, maybe he interpreted her preference for rough sex as seeking something more intense than what he considered normal. However, after she told him she didn't like the gentle stuff and he kept trying, that's a problem. If he was aware of her discomfort, he should have respected her wishes instead of persisting. \n\nHer reaction was to get angry and leave. While it's a strong reaction, her past trauma might influence her feelings. It's important to validate that trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. However, leaving without addressing the issue might not be the best approach for resolving conflicts. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions after being told to stop could be the main issue here. If he continued despite her clear communication, he's not respecting her boundaries. The author's anger stems from her discomfort, which is justified given her history. So maybe the answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't respect them afterward. But I need to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. Did she give him a chance to adjust his behavior? She told him to stop and he kept going, so yes, he didn't follow through. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
