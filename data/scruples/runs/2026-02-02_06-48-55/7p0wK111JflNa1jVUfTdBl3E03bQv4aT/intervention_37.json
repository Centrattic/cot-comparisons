(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, but her boyfriend tried to be gentle and cutesy, which made her uncomfortable. She got mad, left the situation, and hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had communicated her preferences beforehand, so the boyfriend should have known. However, he went ahead with his own approach, which clashed with her needs. She felt uncomfortable and withdrew. The question is whether she's in the wrong for getting angry and leaving.\n\nOn one hand, the author had shared her boundaries, so the boyfriend might have failed to respect them. On the other hand, communication in relationships is two-way. Maybe the boyfriend misunderstood what \"normal\" sex meant. But the author did clarify her discomfort during the interaction. Her reaction of getting angry and leaving could be a valid response to her boundaries being ignored, especially given her trauma background. However, not responding to messages might be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend didn't meet her needs despite prior communication, which is his fault. But the author's response (getting mad and leaving) might have been abrupt, though understandable. Since she had valid reasons rooted in past experiences, it's possible she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs and acted on her discomfort, which is her right.\n"
