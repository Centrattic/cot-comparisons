(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex\u2014it makes her uncomfortable because she had an abusive relationship before. She prefers rough sex to let go and have fun. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being gentle with kisses and cutesy stuff. She didn't like it, told him to stop, got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages since. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The woman had previously communicated her preferences. That's good. The boyfriend, however, might not have understood or respected her boundaries. She mentioned being in an abusive relationship, which adds context. Her discomfort with gentle sex is tied to past trauma, so it's a valid reason. \n\nWhen the boyfriend didn't follow her instructions and continued with the gentle approach, she expressed her discomfort. The problem might be in how she reacted. She got mad, left, and hasn't responded. Maybe he felt ignored or dismissed. But considering her history, her reaction is understandable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she communicated her needs and he didn't respect them, then he's at fault. Her getting mad is a response to his not respecting her boundaries. However, not responding to his messages might be seen as cutting off communication, which is necessary for resolving issues. But given the context of her trauma, her actions could be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have misunderstood \"normal\" sex. Maybe he thought it was a baseline he should follow. But if she had already told him her preferences, he should adjust accordingly. The fact that he kept trying cutesy things after she told him to stop suggests he wasn't respecting her boundaries. \n\nSo, the woman isn't in the wrong for expressing her needs and being upset when they're ignored. The boyfriend is at fault here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
