(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves a 21F and 26M in a months-long relationship. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, which is the opposite of what he did.\n\nFirst, communication is key. She did tell him her preferences beforehand, so he should know. When she asked him to stop the gentle stuff, he didn't comply immediately and kept trying, which could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. That's a red flag. However, her reaction was to get mad and leave without responding to his messages. She didn't explain her feelings to him, which might have led to confusion. But given her trauma, her feelings are valid. He might need to adjust his approach to her needs, but she also needs to communicate better to set clear expectations. It's a two-way street. She's not necessarily in the wrong for getting upset since her preferences are clear, but maybe she could have handled the situation better by discussing it instead of leaving. However, considering her history, her reaction is understandable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
