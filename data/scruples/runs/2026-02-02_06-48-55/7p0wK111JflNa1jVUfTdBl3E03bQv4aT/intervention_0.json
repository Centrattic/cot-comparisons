(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21-year-old woman who got mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She explained that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship and prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. The boyfriend tried to be affectionate, and she got upset, leaving the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman communicated her preferences beforehand, but the boyfriend didn't adhere to them. She felt uncomfortable and left. The boyfriend's actions were based on his understanding, perhaps expecting a more emotional connection, which she doesn't prefer due to her history.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But wait, if she communicated her needs clearly and he didn't respect them, maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong. However, she got angry and left, not responding. But given her trauma, her reaction might be justified. On the other hand, the boyfriend might not have known how to adjust, but since she had told him before, maybe he should have respected that. The question is whether she overreacted or if he was in the wrong for not following her previous communication. The answer might hinge on whether the boyfriend knew her preferences and still proceeded to be gentle. If he did know and ignored her boundaries, he's in the wrong. If she didn't communicate effectively, she's in the wrong. But in the scenario, she did tell him before. Therefore, the boyfriend's actions were a violation of her preferences, leading to her justified anger. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
