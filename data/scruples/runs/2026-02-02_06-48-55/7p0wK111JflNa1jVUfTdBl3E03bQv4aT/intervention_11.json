(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (a 21-year-old female) is upset with her boyfriend (26M) because he was too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, and she had mentioned she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate, preferring rougher sex. She mentioned a past abusive relationship that affects her comfort with gentler sex. \n\nThe last time they had sex, he wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which involved more gentle actions like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but tried other gentle things. Then she got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't replied to his messages.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The person who asked thinks she's in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. She had communicated her preferences before. The boyfriend tried to adjust but maybe didn't fully stop. When she asked him to stop, he continued with other gentle acts. She then left and hasn't responded. \n\nHer reasoning is based on past trauma, which is a valid reason for her preferences. However, the boyfriend might not be aware of the trauma or how to adjust. The fact that she left and hasn't communicated might be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't ideal. But she did tell him she didn't like it and he didn't stop, so maybe she's justified in her reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, walking out and not responding could be seen as abrupt. The question is whether her actions were a reasonable response to his not respecting her boundaries. If he continued after she asked to stop, she's not in the wrong. But maybe she could have handled the communication better. However, given her past, her discomfort is real. \n\nThe key points are: She communicated her preferences. He tried to adjust but didn't fully stop. She got upset and left. She hasn't responded. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If he didn't respect her boundaries after she told him, she's not in the wrong. But if his actions were within the boundaries (maybe she didn't specify that \"gentle\" doesn't include those things), then she might be. However, she did tell him to stop, so he should have respected that. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
