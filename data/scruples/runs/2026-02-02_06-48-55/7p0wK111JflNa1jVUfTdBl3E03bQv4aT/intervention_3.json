(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma. Now, when he tries to be affectionate and gentle, she gets upset and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did communicate her preferences beforehand. That's important because she's not keeping her partner in the dark. But maybe she didn't specify the boundaries clearly enough? Or maybe the boyfriend didn't take her communication seriously enough?\n\nThe boyfriend said he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which might be a term they both understand differently. When she asked, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, and he tried to do other affectionate things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad and left.\n\nThe key points here are mutual communication, past trauma, and how the boyfriend handled her boundaries. The author has a valid reason for her discomfort due to abuse. The boyfriend's actions after she told him to stop might be problematic. If he continued with other affectionate gestures after she expressed discomfort, he might be crossing a boundary.\n\nBut the author also left without answering his messages. While her feelings are justified, walking out might be seen as abrupt. However, considering her trauma, her reaction could be a self-protective measure. The boyfriend should have respected her immediate feedback and adjusted accordingly. If he kept trying to be affectionate after she asked to stop, he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset and leaving. Given the context of her past and the fact that he didn't fully respect her boundaries after she told him to stop, she might not be in the wrong. The main issue could be the boyfriend not adhering to her boundaries post-communication. Therefore, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
