(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is upset because her boyfriend is being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like that and prefers rougher sex. They had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she even told him she's uncomfortable with gentle sex due to past trauma. But when he tried to be gentle last time, she got mad and left.\n\nHmm, so first, she communicated her boundaries clearly. That's a good point. She's justified in her feelings because of her past abuse. But then, when he tried to adjust, she got angry. Wait, she told him she doesn't like gentle, yet he tried to be gentle. That's confusing. Wait, no\u2014the user says she told him she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user says she told him that she doesn't like sex to feel \"too gentle or passionate\" and that it makes her uncomfortable. But she likes rough sex. Then, the boyfriend tried to be gentle (\"normal\" sex, which he defined as gentle), which she didn't like. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. So, she set boundaries, but he didn't follow them. Wait, no\u2014she told him she doesn't like gentle, but he tried to be gentle. So he didn't listen to her boundaries. So she's upset because he's not respecting her preferences. But she's the one who got mad and left. So is she in the wrong for getting angry when he didn't follow her stated preferences?\n\nWait, but maybe the boyfriend was trying to be gentle because he thought that's what she wanted. Wait, the user says she told him she doesn't like gentle. So he was being gentle, which she said to avoid. So he didn't honor her boundary. Therefore, she's justified in being upset. But she reacted by getting angry and leaving. So maybe the question is whether her reaction is appropriate. She did tell him before, but maybe he's not listening. So she's within her rights to be mad if he's not respecting her boundaries. But maybe she could have handled it better. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, considering that she communicated her boundaries, and he didn't follow them, her reaction is understandable. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. So answer B. Unless there's something else. Like, maybe she's being inconsistent. Wait, she said she doesn't like gentle or passionate. Wait, passionate might be similar to rough? Or is passionate different? The user says she likes rough sex. So maybe the boyfriend's attempt at gentle was not connecting. But he was trying to do something she said she didn't like. So she's right to be upset. Therefore, answer B.\n"
