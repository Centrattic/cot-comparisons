(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The author is a 21-year-old woman, and her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly.\n\nShe mentioned that they talked beforehand about her preferences. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it's uncomfortable for her. She has a history of an abusive relationship and finds rough sex more comfortable because it helps her let go and have fun. When he tried to be gentle, with kisses and playing with her hair, she got mad and left.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author clearly communicated her preferences before. The boyfriend, however, didn't adhere to those boundaries during the encounter. He continued with what she found uncomfortable despite her telling him to stop. \n\nHer reaction was to get angry and leave. The question is whether she's at fault. From a communication standpoint, she's not wrong for expressing her needs. People have different preferences, especially after trauma. But maybe she could have handled it more calmly. However, the main issue is that her boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions were in line with his own preferences but ignored what she communicated. That's a problem. The author's anger stems from her discomfort being disregarded. She's not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries. \n\nSo, answer B (No) because she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't respect them. Her reaction is understandable under the circumstances.\n"
