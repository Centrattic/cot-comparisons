(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the 21-year-old woman) is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. The author has a history of being in an abusive relationship and mentioned that rough sex helps her feel more comfortable, whereas gentle or romantic acts make her uncomfortable. She communicated her preferences to him before, but when he tried to be gentle, she got upset and left.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did tell her boyfriend her preferences beforehand, so she's not at fault for not communicating. However, when he tried to be gentle, she got angry. The question is whether her reaction was justified. Since she has a history of abuse, her discomfort with gentle sex might be trauma-related. It's important to validate her feelings. However, the boyfriend might not fully understand her triggers unless she's explained them in detail. \n\nHer reaction\u2014getting angry and leaving\u2014could be seen as a way to set boundaries, but maybe there's a better way to handle it. The boyfriend might feel hurt because he was trying to be considerate. But given her history, her needs are valid. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own comfort, even if it means the boyfriend is caught off guard. However, not responding to his messages might be seen as cutting him off without addressing the issue, which could lead to further problems. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were a reaction to her past trauma and she had communicated her needs. While her abrupt departure might not be the ideal way to handle it, she isn't entirely in the wrong. The boyfriend could also work on understanding her triggers better. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
