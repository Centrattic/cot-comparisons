(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves prior communication where the author clearly stated she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, preferring something rougher. However, the boyfriend's approach last night was more gentle, which upset her, leading her to get angry and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication aspect. The author mentioned they had talked about their likes and dislikes before. She told him she doesn't like gentle sex. So, if he went ahead with a gentle approach, maybe he didn't take her preferences into account. But then again, maybe there's more nuance. Did he not understand her preferences correctly? Or perhaps he had a different intention, like wanting to connect emotionally, which she's uncomfortable with due to her past abuse.\n\nHer reaction: she told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept doing other cutesy things. Then she got mad and left. The key here is whether her communication was clear and if the boyfriend was responsive enough. She did tell him, but he continued with other actions, maybe not respecting her boundaries after she expressed discomfort. However, he did stop the initial action, which might show he tried to adjust.\n\nHer getting angry could be justified if he was ignoring her boundaries. But she left and hasn't responded to his messages. Maybe she should have communicated more clearly instead of just leaving. On the other hand, he might have misread her signals or had his own expectations. \n\nAlso, considering her history of abuse, her preference for rough sex as a way to feel safe might be valid. But if the boyfriend isn't comfortable with that, there's a conflict. The article mentions she said she knows it's strange, but her past trauma influences her preferences. The boyfriend's approach might not align with her needs, and if he's not willing to accommodate, that's a problem on his end.\n\nBut the question is about the author's wrongness. If she communicated her boundaries and he didn't respect them after she told him to stop, then she isn't in the wrong. However, if she didn't give him enough chance to adjust or if her reaction was too harsh, maybe she's partially at fault. But given her history, her discomfort is understandable. So, in this case, the boyfriend might not have respected her boundaries despite prior communication, making the author not at fault. Therefore, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
