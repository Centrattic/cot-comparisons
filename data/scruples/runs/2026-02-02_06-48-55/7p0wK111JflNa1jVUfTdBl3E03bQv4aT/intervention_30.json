(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had already discussed her preferences before, stating she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex due to past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, whereas gentle sex makes her uncomfortable.\n\nThe situation is that the boyfriend tried to have \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing her body and cutesy gestures. She told him to stop, he did, but kept trying, leading her to get angry and leave.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. She had clearly communicated her preferences beforehand. The boyfriend's actions after that might be an issue because he was acting in a way she's already told him she doesn't like. However, maybe he misunderstood what \"normal\" meant to her. But then again, if she's communicated her dislikes clearly, he should adjust.\n\nHer reaction: getting mad and leaving. She did tell him to stop, which he did, but he continued with other actions. She's upset because he didn't respect her boundaries after being told. On the flip side, maybe the boyfriend was trying to connect emotionally, which she's uncomfortable with due to past trauma. Her leaving might be a reaction to not feeling respected, but maybe she could have addressed it more calmly.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she communicated her needs and he didn't respect them, she's not in the wrong. But if she overreacted, maybe she is. However, given her history of abuse and the context that gentle sex makes her uncomfortable, her reaction could be justified. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate of her past and her current preferences. She's in a right to feel uncomfortable and to set boundaries. The fact that she told him to stop and he kept trying could mean he wasn't respecting her boundaries, so she's not in the wrong for being upset. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
