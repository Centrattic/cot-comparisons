(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had talked about her preferences before, and she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. The boyfriend tried to be gentle, even after she told him she didn't like it, and she reacted by getting angry and leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman communicated her preferences initially, which is good. She has a history of abuse, so her discomfort with certain types of intimacy makes sense. The boyfriend, on the other hand, tried to adjust to what he might consider normal or caring sex, but she found that approach off-putting. When she told him to stop, he continued with cutesy gestures, which led to her getting mad and leaving.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, communication is a big part of relationships. She expressed her dislikes upfront, but maybe she didn't communicate her current discomfort during the actual interaction. However, she did tell him to stop. The issue is whether her reaction was justified. She left the situation and hasn't responded to messages. That could be seen as cutting off communication, which might not be the healthiest response. But given her trauma, her emotional reaction is understandable. \n\nThe boyfriend might not have been aware that his actions were triggering her, even though she mentioned it before. But she didn't clearly state during the encounter that his behavior was a problem. However, she did tell him to stop, so he should have respected that. The fact that he kept trying might be the issue. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), it's often about the balance of communication and respect. If she communicated her boundaries and he still continued, he's at fault for not respecting them. But her response of getting angry and leaving without addressing it might be seen as her being in the wrong, as she didn't communicate her needs in that moment. However, considering her trauma history, her emotional reaction is a valid response to feeling uncomfortable or triggered. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. Because she did communicate her boundaries, and her reaction stems from a place of past trauma. The boyfriend should have respected her feedback and adjusted accordingly. The key here is whether the woman acted unreasonably. Given her history and the fact that she told him to stop, her actions are more about self-protection than being the asshole. The boyfriend's actions might be more to blame here for not heeding her signals. But the user thinks she is in the wrong. I need to make sure. The user said they think the author is in the wrong, but the assistant's job is to evaluate. I think the woman isn't in the wrong because she's acting on her communicated boundaries and trauma response. The boyfriend might be the one who didn't adjust properly after her feedback. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
