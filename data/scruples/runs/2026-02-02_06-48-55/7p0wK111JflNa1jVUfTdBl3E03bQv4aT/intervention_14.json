(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman getting upset at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the woman mentions she's 21, and her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She previously told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable because of past abuse. She prefers rough sex to feel like she can let go, while gentle sex makes her anxious.\n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex. When she asked what he meant, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he stopped but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's not answering his messages and is wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nSo, key points here: communication. She had already told him her preferences. He tried something different, and she got upset. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept doing other things. She then left and hasn't responded. \n\nHer reasoning is that she doesn't like gentle sex because of trauma. He might not have realized that his actions were triggering her, even though she had communicated her preferences. But maybe he was trying to be affectionate or change things up. However, since she had already told him her boundaries, and he proceeded with actions she didn't like, maybe he overstepped. But she didn't clarify again or explain why it was a problem. She just told him to stop but he kept doing other things. \n\nHer response was to get angry and leave. Is that justified? If he was following her initial instructions by stopping the kissing but continued with other gestures, maybe she should have communicated more clearly. Alternatively, maybe his actions were not in line with her boundaries, and she's within her right to express her discomfort. \n\nBut wait, she said she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. If he's trying to be gentle, maybe that's conflicting with her needs. However, rough sex requires a safe and consensual environment. If she's uncomfortable with the gentle approach, maybe she needs to communicate that again. But in this case, she already had. \n\nThe problem might be that he didn't follow through on her preferences. If she told him not to do something, and he kept trying different gentle things, that's a problem. However, if he was trying to adjust but she didn't clarify further, maybe there's a communication gap. \n\nAlso, her leaving and not responding could be seen as a harsh reaction. But considering her trauma, maybe her reaction is valid. It's important to consider that past trauma can affect current interactions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual communication and respect for boundaries. If he didn't respect her boundaries by continuing to do things she asked him to stop, he's at fault. But if she didn't explain her trauma and only mentioned her preferences, maybe he couldn't know. However, since she had already communicated her dislike for gentle sex, he should have adhered to that. \n\nTherefore, the boyfriend might be in the wrong for not following her initial boundaries. However, the author's response of getting angry and cutting off communication might be a result of valid discomfort, so she's not entirely wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that she had communicated her preferences and he didn't follow them, even after she told him to stop, she's not in the wrong. She has a right to her boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
