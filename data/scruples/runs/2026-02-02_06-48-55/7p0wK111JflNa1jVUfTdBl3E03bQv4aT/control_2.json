(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend having issues with their sexual preferences.\n\nFirst, the woman (21F) mentioned they had talked about their likes and dislikes beforehand. She specifically told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. The boyfriend then tried to have what he called \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing and cuddling. She got uncomfortable, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and consent. The woman communicated her preferences clearly before. The boyfriend, however, didn't respect her boundaries during the encounter. Even though his intentions might have been good (trying to be affectionate), he didn't take her expressed preferences into account. When she told him to stop, he kept trying to do those things, which escalated her discomfort. Her reaction of getting mad and leaving is understandable because she's standing up for her boundaries. \n\nBut maybe some people would argue that the boyfriend was trying to be caring and that she could have been more understanding. However, since she had already communicated her needs, it's his responsibility to respect them. Also, her past trauma is a significant factor here. It's important to consider that trauma can affect someone's preferences and reactions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't respect them. The boyfriend's actions were the problem, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
