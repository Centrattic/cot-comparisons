(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abuse. The boyfriend tried to be affectionate but she got upset and left.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girl did communicate her preferences upfront, which is good. But then, when the boyfriend tried to adjust, maybe he didn't fully understand her needs. However, the girl got mad and left, which might be a problem. \n\nBut wait, she has a history of abuse. That context is important. Her discomfort with gentle sex could be trauma-related. So maybe she's not wrong for being upset when he's not respecting her boundaries. The boyfriend might have thought \"normal\" sex meant something different, but he should have checked in more. \n\nHowever, after she told him she didn't like it, he kept trying to do things she didn't want. That's not good. He should have stopped immediately. The girl then reacted by getting angry and leaving, not responding. But is that her fault? She's been through trauma, so her reaction might be justified given her past. \n\nOn the other hand, she could have communicated more clearly during the encounter instead of getting angry. But considering her trauma, maybe she's not at fault. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries after she told him. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but considering the trauma aspect, she might not be. The key is whether her reaction was reasonable given her history. The boyfriend should have listened when she asked to stop. So the girl isn't in the wrong.\n"
