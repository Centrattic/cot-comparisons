(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves her previous abusive relationship, which affects her current preferences. She communicated her dislike for gentle sex and a preference for rougher sex. However, the boyfriend tried to be gentle after saying he wanted \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially when it comes to sexual preferences. The author did tell her boyfriend her boundaries and preferences beforehand. But when he didn't follow through, she got upset. The boyfriend might have misunderstood what \"normal\" sex meant to her. Maybe he assumed \"normal\" was more about emotional connection, but she meant it in a different way. \n\nHer reaction was getting mad and leaving, not engaging further. The question is whether her reaction was justified. Given her history of abuse, it's possible that her trauma is affecting her current interactions. She might associate gentle sex with the abuser's behavior, making her uncomfortable. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt that she didn't clarify her needs better or that she left without addressing the issue directly.\n\nIs she in the wrong? It depends on whether she gave him enough information and if her reaction was proportionate. She did communicate her preferences, but maybe not clearly enough. However, given her past, it's understandable she has specific needs. The boyfriend's actions, though well-intentioned, might not align with her needs. Her anger is a reaction to not having her boundaries respected, which is valid. But leaving without addressing it might be seen as cutting off communication. However, considering her trauma, her response isn't entirely her fault. The blame isn't entirely on her. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
