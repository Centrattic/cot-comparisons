(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset because her boyfriend, 26, was too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed preferences, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, preferring rougher encounters. She has a history of an abusive relationship, which she connects to her discomfort with gentle sex. Last night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to her dissatisfaction and her leaving the situation. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. She did mention her preferences before, so that's good. However, when the situation arose, she got mad and left without much communication. The boyfriend tried to adjust after she expressed discomfort but kept attempting to do things she didn't like. She hasn't responded to his messages, which might be cutting off communication. \n\nIt's important to consider consent and mutual satisfaction. Both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. She has valid reasons tied to her past trauma, so her feelings are real. However, reacting by leaving and not communicating further could be seen as not addressing the issue properly. The boyfriend, while not perfect, was trying to adjust after her initial feedback. \n\nThe key points are: prior communication, her trauma history, immediate reaction, and lack of follow-up communication. While her feelings are valid, her response might not be the healthiest way to handle the conflict. The boyfriend might need to be more attentive to her specific needs, but she also needs to express her needs clearly during the situation rather than disengaging. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering she didn't address the issue constructively after the fact, maybe she's partially at fault. However, her trauma history complicates things. The answer might hinge on whether the immediate reaction is judged as wrong. Since she left and didn't communicate further, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. Answer A (Yes) might be appropriate here.\n"
