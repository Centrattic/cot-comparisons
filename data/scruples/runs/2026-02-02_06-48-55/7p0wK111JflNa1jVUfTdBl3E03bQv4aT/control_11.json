(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation is that the author (21F) has a history of an abusive relationship and prefers rough sex, which makes her feel comfortable and lets her let go. The boyfriend, on the other hand, wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved more gentle and affectionate actions like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses. The author told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying, and she got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she hasn't answered his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author had previously communicated her preferences to the boyfriend. He acknowledged that and even when he tried to proceed differently after she told him to stop, he didn't fully respect her boundaries. That's a problem. The boyfriend's actions after being told to stop might be a sign that he's not taking her boundaries seriously, which could lead to issues in the relationship.\n\nThen there's the author's reaction. She got mad and left. But given her history of abuse, her discomfort with gentle sex is understandable. She's trying to communicate her needs, which are different from what the relationship is typically supposed to be. Her anger comes from being frustrated that her boundaries weren't respected, even after she explicitly told him to stop. \n\nThe part about the abusive relationship is important. It might affect her emotional and physical responses. The boyfriend might not fully grasp the trauma she's dealing with, which could make him less sensitive to her needs. However, she did tell him her preferences upfront, so he should be aware. If he still proceeds despite her clear instructions, that's a problem.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's message about wanting \"normal\" sex might imply he has different expectations. But since they had discussed their likes and dislikes, he should have been aware of her preferences. The fact that he continued with actions she didn't like after she told him to stop shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014leaving and not responding\u2014could be seen as a reaction to feeling invalidated. But in relationships, communication is key. Maybe she should have talked to him after the fact instead of ghosting, but given the context, her reaction might be understandable given the stress of her past.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries, and the boyfriend didn't respect them despite knowing. Her history adds context to her preferences. The boyfriend is at fault here for not respecting her wishes after she told him to stop. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
