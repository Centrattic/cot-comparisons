(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman who gets upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She told him her preferences before, but he still tried to be gentle, even after she expressed discomfort again. She got mad, left, and hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author had previously communicated her preferences, which is good. The boyfriend might not have fully understood or respected her boundaries. But he did stop when she said she didn't like it. However, she's now getting angry and leaving, which could be a reaction to her trauma. \n\nHer history of abuse is important here. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. If rough sex helps her feel better, then a gentle approach might trigger her. The boyfriend might be trying to be caring, but it's conflicting with her needs. \n\nBut the boyfriend should have been more responsive. Even if he meant to be gentle, after she expressed discomfort, he kept trying cute things. Maybe he didn't take her feedback seriously enough. The author's reaction is a response to her trauma, not necessarily being in the wrong. She's trying to communicate her needs, and the boyfriend might need to adjust more. \n\nHowever, the author left without addressing it and hasn't responded. That could be seen as avoiding communication. But given her trauma, her reaction is understandable. The key here is whether she's at fault for her needs vs. her actions. She's not wrong for having boundaries, but maybe the way she handled it? But considering the trauma, her actions are a result of her past. So I think she's not in the wrong.\n"
