(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves prior communication about preferences, with the author expressing discomfort with gentle sex due to past trauma. The boyfriend tried to be gentle and affectionate, which the author disliked, leading to her anger and leaving.\n\nFirst, the author had already communicated her preferences. The boyfriend might not have adjusted properly, maybe not understanding the extent of her discomfort. Her reaction\u2014getting mad and leaving\u2014could be seen as a response to his not heeding her boundaries. But is she in the wrong for being upset? She's justified in needing his actions to align with her communicated needs. However, her response of cutting contact might be seen as harsh. But considering her history of abuse, her emotional reaction is understandable. The key is whether she's at fault for reacting to his failure to respect her boundaries. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't meet them, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
