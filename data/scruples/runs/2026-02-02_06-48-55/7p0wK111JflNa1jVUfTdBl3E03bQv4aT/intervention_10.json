(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the 21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves previous communication about preferences, an abusive past, and the recent incident where she left after he was gentle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication aspect. She mentioned they talked about likes and dislikes before, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. So she communicated her preferences. However, when he tried to be gentle, she got upset and left. But he did stop when she told him, which shows he was responsive. \n\nHer background of an abusive relationship might affect her comfort with rough sex versus gentle. She feels that rough sex helps her let go, while gentle makes her uncomfortable. That's a valid personal experience, so her preference isn't arbitrary. \n\nOn the other hand, her reaction was to get mad, put on clothes, and leave without responding to messages. That might be abrupt. Even though she communicated her needs, her response could be seen as not allowing open communication. Maybe she could have discussed it calmly instead of leaving. \n\nBut considering her history, her discomfort is a legitimate feeling. The boyfriend might not fully understand her past trauma, and if he's trying to be gentle because he thinks that's what's needed, but it's actually causing her distress, then the issue is about mismatched understanding. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If she communicated her needs, but when he tried to follow them in a way that still made her uncomfortable, she reacted negatively. However, her reaction might stem from a place of trauma. The boyfriend might need to be more attuned to her specific needs beyond what was communicated. \n\nAlternatively, if she left without addressing it, maybe she's not giving him a chance to adjust. The key is whether she gave him a chance to correct his approach. She told him to stop, but he kept doing cutesy things. Maybe she needs to communicate more clearly when that happens. \n\nBut given her history, maybe she's not wrong for feeling that way. The boyfriend might need to be more flexible and check in with her during the act. So, perhaps she's not in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her communication was sufficient and if her reaction was proportionate. Since she did communicate and he didn't adjust enough, maybe she's not wrong. Answer B.\n"
