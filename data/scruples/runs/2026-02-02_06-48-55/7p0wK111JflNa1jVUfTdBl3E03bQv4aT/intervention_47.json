(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman (21F) and her boyfriend (26M) who have been dating for a few months. She's upset because he was too gentle during sex, which made her uncomfortable. She mentioned she prefers rough sex and that gentle, emotional connections make her anxious due to her past abusive relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The woman told him her preferences beforehand, but maybe he didn't fully understand or adapt. However, during the encounter, she told him to stop when he was being gentle, but he continued with cutesy things. That could be a problem if he didn't respect her boundaries after she asked him to stop. \n\nBut wait, she also said she got mad and left, and hasn't answered his messages. Is she in the wrong for that? If he was responding to her initial preferences but she changed her mind and didn't communicate clearly again, maybe she could have been more explicit. However, she did tell him to stop, so he should have respected that. \n\nHer past with an abusive relationship is a key point. That might explain her preference for rough sex as a way to feel in control or process trauma. The boyfriend might not fully understand her triggers. If he's being gentle and it's triggering her, he should adjust, but she also needs to communicate clearly what's needed. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's trying to connect emotionally and she's rejecting that, maybe she's not being considerate of his needs. But the main issue is her comfort. She has the right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the question is whether her reaction was justified. She told him to stop and he kept trying, so she's within her rights to be upset. However, leaving without addressing it and not responding to messages might be unkind. But given her discomfort and history, her actions could be seen as a valid reaction to her needs not being met. \n\nThe key is whether her initial communication was clear and if he respected her boundaries. If he continued after she told him to stop, he's at fault. If she then retreated without communication, maybe she's also at fault for not addressing it. But considering her trauma, maybe her actions are understandable. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries and he didn't respect them after she told him to stop. Her reaction is a result of her valid needs and past experiences. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
