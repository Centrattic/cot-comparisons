(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the woman (21F) is upset because her boyfriend (26M) is too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed her preferences before\u2014she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate. Her past abusive relationship affects her comfort, and she prefers rough sex. \n\nLast night, when they were about to have sex, he mentioned wanting \"normal\" sex and started doing gentle things like kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did but kept trying with cutesy stuff. She got mad, put on her clothes, and left. Now she's not responding to his messages.\n\nShe thinks she might be in the wrong but is asking for opinions. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's in the wrong. She communicated her preferences, right? She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate, and that rough sex helps her. But when he tried to be gentle, she got upset. However, he tried to be gentle after she told him, but she still got angry. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. When he said \"normal\" sex, maybe he meant his usual style, which is gentle. She might have thought \"normal\" meant standard, but he might have interpreted it differently. Also, she had previously communicated her needs, so he might not have fully understood or adjusted properly. \n\nShe did tell him to stop, and he did, but kept trying with other gentle actions. She got mad and left. Is that a justified reaction? Considering her past trauma, her discomfort is valid. But she didn't give him a chance to adjust again after stopping. Maybe she could have communicated more clearly instead of just leaving. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have felt hurt because she left without explanation. The fact that she's not responding now adds to the tension. \n\nSo, was she in the wrong? She had communicated her needs, but perhaps she didn't handle it as well as she could have. She might be right in her feelings but wrong in the way she reacted. However, given her trauma background, her reaction might be a result of unresolved issues. \n\nBut the question is about right or wrong. If the boyfriend was following her previous instructions, then she's wrong to be upset. But if he misunderstood or didn't adapt properly, then he might have some responsibility. The problem is that she told him her preferences, so if he was being gentle despite that, he's at fault. However, if he was trying to connect emotionally, which she doesn't want, and she's not getting that, maybe it's a miscommunication. \n\nBut she did tell him to stop, which he did, but then continued with other gestures. Maybe he didn't realize those were also gentle. She might need to be more specific about what she wants. But given her history, her reaction is more about her trauma than the actions themselves. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the boyfriend was following her instructions and she still got mad, then she's at fault. But if he didn't follow her boundaries correctly, then he's in the wrong. The key is whether he was adhering to her stated preferences. The user says she told him she doesn't like gentle. So if he was being gentle, he violated her boundaries, making him wrong. However, if she's now acting out because he was following her previous advice but she changed her mind, maybe she's at fault. \n\nWait, no. She said she doesn't like it when it's gentle. So if he's doing gentle stuff, he's not respecting her boundaries. But she said he stopped when she told him. Maybe she's still upset because the initial gentle actions made her uncomfortable, even after he stopped. She might be in the right to be upset because he didn't adjust properly. But then she left without explanation, which could be hurtful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend was being gentle despite her telling him not to, then he's in the wrong. But she might still be in the right to be upset. However, her reaction of getting mad and leaving without addressing the issue might be in the wrong. So it's a bit of both. But the question is if she's in the wrong. \n\nGiven that she had communicated her preferences, and he was being gentle, he's the one violating boundaries. So she's not in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not adjusting properly. However, her reaction of getting mad and leaving without explaining might have been unkind. But that doesn't necessarily make her in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because she communicated her needs and had a valid reason to be upset. Her reaction might not be the best, but she's not in the wrong for being upset given her history. The boyfriend might be at fault for not adhering to her boundaries.\n"
