(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a 21-year-old woman who's been dating her boyfriend for a few months. They've had regular sex and she had previously told him that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She explains that this is because of a past abusive relationship, and she prefers rough sex to feel like she can let go and have fun. Gentle and emotionally connected sex makes her anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nThen, last night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex. She asked what he meant, and he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, and he did but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages since and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong).\n\nLet me consider the key points. Communication is crucial in relationships. The author had previously communicated her preferences, and the boyfriend tried to follow through but maybe misunderstood. However, during the actual interaction, when she told him to stop and he continued with other affectionate but not rough actions, she reacted by leaving. \n\nHer past trauma is a significant factor. People's preferences can be shaped by their experiences, and she's clearly stating that gentle sex triggers discomfort. If the boyfriend was trying to be considerate, maybe he didn't realize that his actions were still making her uncomfortable. But she did tell him to stop, and he didn't completely stop\u2014maybe he thought he was being affectionate in a way that was different from being \"rough.\" \n\nIs she in the wrong for getting upset? If he was following her previous instructions but she still felt uncomfortable and communicated that, then she has a right to be upset. However, maybe there's a communication breakdown. She told him she doesn't like gentle sex, but perhaps he thought the \"normal\" sex he was going for was more about being affectionate but not necessarily the rough kind. Maybe she could have been more specific about exactly what she does want. But given her past, it's her right to communicate her needs. If he continued after she told him to stop, then he's at fault for not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she left might be a valid response to feeling uncomfortable and not respected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she could have handled it more calmly. But given the emotional weight of her past trauma, it's understandable that she reacted strongly. The boyfriend might need to be more attuned to her specific needs beyond just the initial conversation. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her discomfort and boundaries, and the boyfriend didn't fully respect them. Her reaction is a response to being triggered by his actions despite prior communication. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
