(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating for a few months and have been having regular sex. They talked about their likes and dislikes beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like sex to feel too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She mentions a history of an abusive relationship and found that rough sex helps her let go and enjoy it, whereas gentle, emotional sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him doing things like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses. She didn't like it, told him to stop, and then left. She hasn't responded to his messages and is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider communication. The author mentioned they discussed their preferences before. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. That's important because she communicated her boundaries. However, when he went ahead with his own idea of \"normal\" sex, maybe he didn't take her previous communication into account. But maybe \"normal\" for him is different than what she meant. There might be a miscommunication here. \n\nHer past abuse could influence her current preferences. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. If she's been in an abusive relationship, her current preferences might be a way to feel safe. She's trying to avoid situations that trigger her. So, when he deviates from what she's comfortable with, even if they discussed it, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries now. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel that they're in a new relationship, and he's trying to be affectionate. He might not realize that his actions are causing her discomfort. But since she had already communicated her discomfort with gentle sex, his actions could be seen as disregarding her boundaries. \n\nThen there's her reaction. She got mad, told him to stop, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages. Is her reaction appropriate? If he crossed her boundaries despite prior communication, her anger is valid. But maybe there's a need for further discussion instead of cutting off communication entirely. However, given her history, maybe she's dealing with complex emotions here. \n\nThe key points are: prior communication of boundaries, the boyfriend not adhering to them, and the impact on her mental state due to past trauma. If he didn't respect her previously stated preferences, he's at fault. If she's not allowing any form of communication to resolve the issue, maybe she's at fault. But in this case, the author left without explaining further, which might be impeding resolution. \n\nBut given that she's been explicit about her needs and he didn't honor them, maybe the boyfriend is also at fault. However, the question is about the author's actions. She communicated her needs, he didn't follow through, she expressed her discomfort, he kept trying, leading her to leave. So, is she wrong for getting angry and leaving? Or is he wrong for not respecting her boundaries?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she had already told him her preferences, and he didn't listen, then he's the one in the wrong. Her reaction of getting mad is understandable. But maybe she could have addressed it differently. However, given her trauma, her reaction is a valid response to her boundaries being crossed. So the author might not be in the wrong here. \n\nAlternatively, if the boyfriend's actions were a reasonable attempt to connect and she misinterpreted them, but since she had clearly communicated her dislike for gentle sex, that might not be the case. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries and he didn't respect them. Her reaction is a response to her comfort and safety being compromised. However, cutting off communication entirely might hinder resolution, but given her history, it's a reaction to stress and discomfort. So the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
