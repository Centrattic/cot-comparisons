(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have had regular sex. She told him upfront that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable, stemming from an abusive past. She prefers rough sex, which helps her let go and have fun.\n\nThen, last night, the boyfriend said he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being more gentle and affectionate\u2014kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She didn't like it, told him to stop, then left. She hasn't responded to his messages and is asking if she's at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's in the wrong. Key points: She communicated her preferences beforehand. The boyfriend didn't follow her boundaries when they had sex. She expressed discomfort again during the encounter. Then she left, which is a reaction to his not respecting her boundaries. \n\nBut wait, maybe the boyfriend was trying to be more attentive or connect emotionally. However, she had already told him her preferences. If he went against that, then he's the one not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she tried to tell him to stop and he kept going suggests he wasn't listening. She then left, which is a form of self-preservation. \n\nBut is getting mad at him for not following her preferences wrong? If she communicated her needs and he didn't honor them, then she has a legitimate reason to be upset. The question is whether her reaction (getting mad, leaving, not replying) is justified. \n\nAlso, her background with an abusive relationship might affect her current preferences. It's important that her partner respects her boundaries, especially given her history. So if he's not respecting her wishes, she's not wrong for being upset. \n\nThe answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a nuance where she could have communicated better or given him feedback during the act. But she did tell him she didn't like it, and he kept going. So she's in the right to be upset. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
