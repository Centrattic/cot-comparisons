(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 21-year-old woman, is upset with her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, and she told him she didn't like it when sex was gentle or passionate because it made her uncomfortable. She mentioned a past abusive relationship, which affects her preference for rougher sex as a way to feel in control or let go.\n\nThen, when her boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she interpreted as being too gentle with kisses and cuddly stuff, she got mad, told him to stop, and left. She's now wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author had previously communicated her preferences to him. If he understood and respected that, then maybe he made a mistake by not following her boundaries. However, the boyfriend might not have fully understood what \"normal\" meant in her context. She might have different definitions of what's normal compared to him. Maybe she thought \"normal\" meant rougher, but he took it as more gentle. That's a communication breakdown.\n\nHer past trauma from the abusive relationship is a significant factor here. It affects her current sexual preferences. It's important to recognize that people have different needs based on their experiences. If she's honest about her needs, it's up to the partner to adjust accordingly. However, if the boyfriend is doing things that she's explicitly said not to like, then he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt if she left abruptly after he tried to be affectionate. But since she communicated her discomfort, he should adjust. The fact that she had to tell him to stop suggests he wasn't respecting her boundaries. She has the right to set her boundaries, and he should respect them. However, maybe there's a lack of mutual understanding here. Both might need to communicate more clearly about their expectations and comfort levels.\n\nSo, the author got mad because he wasn't respecting her stated preferences. If she had told him again during the act and he kept doing it, then she's justified in her reaction. However, maybe there's a need for more open communication to ensure both are on the same page. The boyfriend might need to ask for clarification on what she means by rough sex or how to adjust. But the key point is that she had communicated her needs before, and he didn't follow through. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. However, the author's reaction of getting mad and leaving might be a bit abrupt, but considering her past, it's understandable. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
