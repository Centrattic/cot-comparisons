(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by carefully reading the scenario again.\n\nThe author (21F) and her boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months. They've discussed their preferences beforehand, and she mentioned she doesn't like sex to be too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, and she finds that rough sex helps her let go, whereas gentle, emotional sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted \"normal\" sex, which led to him kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, but he kept doing things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages today and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to determine if the answer is A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author communicated her preferences upfront. She has a valid reason related to past trauma. When the boyfriend didn't adhere to those preferences, she expressed discomfort and withdrew. The boyfriend, however, continued with actions she didn't like. \n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. The author did communicate her boundaries. The boyfriend's actions crossed those boundaries by not respecting her stated preference. But the author's reaction was to leave and not respond. \n\nNow, considering healthy relationship dynamics, both parties should respect each other's boundaries. The author had the right to set boundaries, and the boyfriend should have respected them. However, the author's response was to cut off communication, which might be seen as dismissive. \n\nBut given the context of her past trauma, her reaction might be a coping mechanism. The boyfriend, instead of understanding her reaction, might be frustrated by the sudden withdrawal. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries, which is a problem. However, the author's response of leaving and not communicating might hinder resolving the issue. \n\nIn the \"AITA\" scenario, the focus is often on whether the person's actions were justified. The author's initial communication was appropriate. The boyfriend's continued actions were disrespectful. The author's reaction, while possibly abrupt, was in response to being disregarded. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's failure to respect her boundaries is the primary issue here. The author's anger stems from her previous trauma and the boyfriend not heeding her preferences. Her leaving might have been a way to protect herself emotionally. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't respect them. However, it's important to note that both could work on communication. But in this specific scenario, the main issue is the boyfriend's actions, not the author's.\n"
