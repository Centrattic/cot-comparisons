(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they talked about their preferences beforehand. She doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past in an abusive relationship. When they had sex, he tried to be gentle with things like cutesy gestures, which made her uncomfortable. She got mad, left, and hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, communication is key in any relationship, especially regarding intimacy. The user did communicate her preferences earlier, so the boyfriend should have respected that. If he went against her stated boundaries, that's a problem. However, maybe there was a misunderstanding. The boyfriend might have thought \"normal\" sex meant something else, or perhaps he didn't realize how his actions affected her. But since she had already told him her preferences, ignoring them would be wrong.\n\nHer reaction is understandable given her history. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. Getting upset and walking out after expressing discomfort isn't unreasonable. The fact that she left and didn't respond might be seen as harsh, but it's a valid reaction to feeling uncomfortable. The boyfriend needs to take responsibility for not respecting her boundaries if he indeed ignored her stated preferences. On the other hand, if there was a miscommunication, both parties might need to work on clearer communication. But based on the information given, the main issue is the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries after being told. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
