(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, the user provided context: they've been dating a few months, have talked about likes and dislikes. The author (21F) mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex, which helps her relax, but gentle makes her uncomfortable. \n\nThe situation: the boyfriend wanted \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying. She got mad, put on clothes, and left. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author had already told her boyfriend her preferences. He might not have fully understood or respected them, but she did communicate her needs. When he continued after she told him to stop, that's a problem. Her reaction was to leave, which could be seen as a valid way to set boundaries, especially given her trauma background. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend was trying to be considerate and adjust? However, the author had specific needs she communicated. If he kept doing things she didn't like after she told him to stop, that's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe other angle is that maybe the boyfriend was trying to be gentle because of her past trauma, assuming that's what she needed. But since she had already told him that gentle made her uncomfortable, his continued actions were not respecting her current needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries and the boyfriend didn't adhere to them after being told. Her reaction to leave could be a healthy boundary-setting. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
