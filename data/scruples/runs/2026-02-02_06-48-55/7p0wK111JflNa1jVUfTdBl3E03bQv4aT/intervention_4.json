(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She mentioned that she communicated her preferences beforehand, stating she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; instead, she prefers rougher sex. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship and has found that rough sex helps her let go and have fun, whereas gentle, emotionally connecting sex makes her uncomfortable and anxious.\n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being gentle\u2014kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but then continued with cutesy actions like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, told him to stop, left the room, and hasn't answered his messages. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider communication. The author did communicate her preferences upfront, which is good. She mentioned not liking gentle sex. However, the boyfriend interpreted \"normal\" sex as gentle, which might not align with her expectations. But he did stop when she told him to, so he was responsive. However, he continued with cutesy actions after she asked to stop. That's a problem because she explicitly told him to stop, and he didn't.\n\nNow, looking at her reaction: she got mad, told him to stop, put on clothes, and left. Then she didn't respond to his messages. This could be seen as a valid reaction if she felt uncomfortable. But maybe there's an issue with how she handled the conflict. Did she give him a chance to adjust again? Did she communicate clearly enough during the interaction?\n\nHer history of abuse is important here. Trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. She might be triggered by gentle touch because of her past. However, rough sex should be consensual and not forced. The fact that she found rough sex to help her let go suggests that her preferences are legitimate, but she needs to ensure that both partners are comfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions after being told to stop might be problematic. If he continued with cutesy things despite her discomfort, that's a breach of her boundaries. However, if his intention was to connect emotionally and she's not in the mood for that, maybe there's a mismatch in their expectations of what \"normal\" sex entails. \n\nThe author's response of leaving and not responding could be seen as a way to protect herself, which is understandable given her history. However, not responding to his messages might be cutting off communication, which is necessary for resolving conflicts in a relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author communicated her needs upfront, but the boyfriend didn't fully respect her boundaries afterward. She did tell him to stop, which he partially addressed but continued with other actions. Her reaction, while valid given her trauma, might be seen as not giving him a chance to adjust again. However, given her history, her discomfort is real. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the boyfriend continued actions after she told him to stop, he's at fault. But the author left and didn't respond, which could be seen as not taking responsibility for addressing the issue through communication. However, given her trauma, maybe her actions are a result of that. \n\nI think the key points are whether the boyfriend respected her boundaries after she told him to stop and whether the author took the necessary steps to communicate clearly. Since she did tell him to stop and he continued with different actions, he might be at fault. But her not responding could be seen as not engaging in the conversation. However, considering her history, it's a complex situation. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she communicated her needs and he didn't respect them, she might not be in the wrong. But if she could have handled it differently (like discussing it after), maybe she's partially responsible. Since she did tell him to stop and left, which is a valid self-protective measure, I might lean towards her not being in the wrong. However, the initial communication might have been unclear. She said she doesn't like gentle sex, but maybe she didn't specify that she doesn't want any emotional connection during sex. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. \n\nBut given her explicit communication and the boyfriend's continued actions, she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
