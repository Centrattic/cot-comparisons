(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves communication about preferences and past trauma.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned she told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle sex because of her past abusive relationship. That's important because she communicated her needs. The boyfriend, however, went with a gentle approach, which made her uncomfortable. She got mad and left, then ignored his messages.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author expressed her boundaries clearly. The boyfriend might not have been aware that the term \"normal\" sex meant something different to her. But he did start things she disliked, so maybe he didn't take her previous communication seriously. However, she reacted by getting angry and leaving, which might be a valid reaction given her trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, she could have handled it more constructively, like discussing it after the fact instead of cutting off communication. But considering her history, her reaction isn't entirely her fault. The boyfriend should have respected her established boundaries. So, the author isn't wrong for being upset. The answer is B.\n"
