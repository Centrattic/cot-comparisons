(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable. She had an abusive past, and rough sex helps her feel more at ease. \n\nLast time, when they were about to have sex, he said he wanted \"normal\" sex. When she asked what he meant, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, but he kept doing cute things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put clothes on, and left. Now she's not answering his messages and is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sex. The author did communicate her preferences beforehand. However, the boyfriend might not have fully understood or respected her boundaries. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past. His actions contradict her stated preferences, which could be a problem. But maybe he thought \"normal\" sex meant something else? Or perhaps he was trying to be gentle because of her past, not knowing she actually wants rougher sex.\n\nWait, the user says she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. So she wants sex that's more about physicality rather than emotional connection. Her boyfriend's approach was gentle and emotional, which she finds uncomfortable. She communicated this, but he didn't follow through. She got mad and left. \n\nIn that case, she's within her right to be upset. If someone's preferences are communicated and not respected, it's valid to react. However, maybe the boyfriend is trying to adjust, but there's a misunderstanding. For example, maybe he thought \"rough sex\" was too intense, but she wants something in between. Or maybe he's not sure how to transition from gentle to rough without causing discomfort. \n\nBut the key point is that she told him her boundaries. If he's not respecting them, then she's not in the wrong for being upset. Also, considering her history of abuse, her triggers are valid. However, it's possible that he's trying to be considerate based on her past, not knowing that she actually needs a different approach. \n\nAnother angle: when she told him to stop, he kept trying, which might indicate he wasn't fully respecting her current comfort level. She might have felt disrespected or dismissed. So she left, which is a valid response if she felt his actions were violating her boundaries. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she communicated her needs and he didn't follow through, she's not at fault. However, maybe there was a miscommunication. For example, when she said she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, maybe she meant not to be too aggressive, but he interpreted it as not wanting any gentleness. Without clear communication, misunderstandings can happen. But since she had mentioned her preference before, it's on him to adjust. \n\nAlso, her reaction of getting mad and leaving is a valid emotional response. If he's not respecting her boundaries, she's justified in being upset. The fact that she has a history of abuse makes her triggers more severe, so her discomfort is significant. \n\nSo putting it all together: She communicated her preferences. He didn't follow them, and she's upset. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
