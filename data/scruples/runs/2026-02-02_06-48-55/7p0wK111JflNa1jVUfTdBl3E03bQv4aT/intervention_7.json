(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman in a new relationship with her boyfriend. She's upset because he was too gentle during sex, which made her uncomfortable. She mentioned they'd talked about their preferences beforehand, and she specifically told him she didn't like gentle or passionate sex. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, and rough sex helps her feel more at ease. Last time, he tried to be gentle, she got mad, and she left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication is key. She did tell him her preferences upfront, which is good. But when he tried to adjust, maybe he didn't fully understand what she meant. He might have interpreted \"not gentle\" as being more forceful, but perhaps he still approached it in a way that didn't align with her needs. However, when she told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying other things. That could be a problem because after she expressed discomfort, he didn't respect her wishes, which might be his fault.\n\nThen there's the part where she got mad and left. She hasn't responded to his messages. She might be reacting out of frustration, but her reaction (leaving and not communicating) could be seen as abrupt. However, given her past trauma, her sensitivity is understandable. On the other hand, the boyfriend's persistence after she asked him to stop could also be a red flag. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If he was following her instructions as best as he could and she still got upset, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. But if he kept doing things she didn't like after she told him to stop, he's at fault. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the context of her past and the boyfriend's actions, maybe it's more nuanced. She might be justified in her reaction, especially if he didn't fully heed her boundaries. However, her response of leaving without addressing it properly might be seen as harsh. But given her history, it's a valid response. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
