(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating for a few months and have been having regular sex. She told him before that she doesn't like sex to feel too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. Her reason is that she was in an abusive relationship before, and now she finds that rough sex helps her let go and have fun, whereas gentle, emotional sex makes her anxious. \n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex. When she asked what he meant, he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, and he did, but then he kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she hasn't answered his messages and is asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The author had already communicated her preferences to her boyfriend. He acknowledged that, but then proceeded to do things she didn't like. Even though he stopped after she told him, he kept trying other things she didn't want. That's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions after she told him to stop might be a problem. If she clearly expressed her discomfort and he continued with other affectionate gestures, that could be seen as not respecting her. However, maybe there was a misunderstanding about what \"normal\" meant. But since she had already told him her preferences, expecting him to honor that is reasonable.\n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave. While it's a strong reaction, it's a response to her boundaries being ignored. She might feel disrespected, especially considering her history. The fact that she's now not responding to his messages could be because she's upset or needs space, which is normal after a conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend might not understand why she's upset if he thought he was being affectionate, but since she had specific needs that were not met, her anger is justified. It's possible he didn't realize that \"cutesy\" things were part of the gentle sex she doesn't like. However, she had already communicated her discomfort with gentle stuff, so he should be more attuned to that now.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have some role. The author could have communicated her discomfort more clearly during the situation, but she did tell him to stop. The boyfriend didn't adjust his actions after she expressed her needs. So the main issue is his continued actions despite her clear communication. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for getting mad because her boundaries were not respected. She's not the one at fault for standing up for herself in a situation that made her uncomfortable, especially given her trauma history.\n"
