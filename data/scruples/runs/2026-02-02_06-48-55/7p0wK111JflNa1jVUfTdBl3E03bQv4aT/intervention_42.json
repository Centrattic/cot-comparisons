(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21F who's been in a relationship with a 26M boyfriend for a few months. They've had sex regularly, and she told him before that she doesn't like it when sex is too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, and she finds that rough sex helps her let go, whereas gentle and emotional sex makes her anxious.\n\nLast night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she interpreted as gentle. She mentioned that he started kissing her body a lot, which she didn't like. When she told him to stop, he did but then continued with cutesy gestures like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (her) is in the wrong. The initial opinion is that she is in the wrong, but they want the actual assessment.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The user had previously communicated her preferences, so the boyfriend should have respected that. However, when she told him to stop, he listened but then continued with other gestures, which might not have been respecting her boundaries. However, she reacted by leaving and not responding, which could be seen as cutting off communication, which is not healthy. \n\nBut considering her history of abuse, her discomfort is valid. She might have PTSD or trauma triggers. The boyfriend's actions, even if well-intentioned, might be triggering her. However, after she told him to stop the first time, he adjusted but then continued with other actions. Maybe he didn't fully understand her needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author left without discussing further and hasn't replied. That could be seen as not taking responsibility for her part in the conflict. However, given her trauma, her reaction might be a coping mechanism. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend didn't follow her instructions properly, but she could have communicated again. However, given her history, her reaction is understandable. The fact that she's not responding might be part of her trauma response too. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since she had communicated her preferences before, and he tried to adjust, maybe she should have tried to explain again. But given her trauma, it's not entirely her fault. However, not responding and cutting off communication is not healthy. So maybe she is partially at fault, but not entirely. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, sometimes the person with the trauma is seen as not the asshole, even if their actions could be problematic. So maybe B is the answer. But she did leave without communication, which could be seen as a problem. \n\nBut given the context of her past and current triggers, her reaction is a result of that trauma. So perhaps she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
