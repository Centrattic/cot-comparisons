(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The context is that she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abuse, and she prefers rough sex. Last time, he tried to be gentle again, she got mad, left, and hasn't replied.\n\nFirst, I need to check if she communicated her preferences clearly. She says they talked beforehand, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex. So she did her part by communicating her needs. That's important because in relationships, communication is key. If she had not mentioned this, maybe he wouldn't know, but she did.\n\nThen, when he tried to be gentle again, she told him she didn't like it, and he stopped but kept doing other cutesy things. She got mad and left. The question is whether her reaction is justified. She has a history of abuse, which affects her current preferences. That's a valid reason to have different needs in the bedroom. Her discomfort is real and rooted in trauma, so it's not just about being picky.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend might be trying to connect emotionally, which is natural. But since she communicated her preferences, he should adjust. However, he didn't fully comply after she told him to stop. Maybe he didn't understand or wasn't aware that the cutesy gestures were part of the issue. But she had already told him she didn't like it, so he should respect that.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014leaving and not replying\u2014could be seen as abrupt, but given her trauma, it's a way of protecting herself. She might need space to process her feelings. However, not communicating after could be seen as cutting him off without giving him a chance to explain or adjust. Maybe she should have discussed it more calmly.\n\nBut considering her history and the fact that she communicated her needs, her reaction is a response to something that makes her uncomfortable. It's not about right or wrong entirely. The boyfriend might need to be more attentive to her specific instructions, while she could use a more constructive approach to address his actions without cutting contact.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and acted based on her trauma. The boyfriend also isn't entirely at fault if he misunderstood or couldn't adjust immediately. The issue is a communication breakdown and differing needs. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
