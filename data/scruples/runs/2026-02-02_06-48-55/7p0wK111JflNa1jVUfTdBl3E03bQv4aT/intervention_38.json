(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21-year-old woman who's upset because her 26-year-old boyfriend is being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she's uncomfortable with gentle or passionate sex because of a past abusive relationship, and she prefers rough sex to feel okay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says she communicated her preferences to her boyfriend beforehand. That's important because communication is key in relationships. But she also says she was in an abusive relationship before, which might make her have different needs. Now, in this situation, the boyfriend tried to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle, and she got upset because he was being too affectionate with things like kissing and playing with her hair. She then left and hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider if she's justified. Since she communicated her needs, and he didn't follow through, maybe he's at fault for not respecting her boundaries. However, she did lash out and leave without addressing his feelings. Maybe there's a middle ground here. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe her reaction is valid because of her past trauma. However, getting mad and cutting off communication might not be the best way to handle it. The boyfriend might have been trying to connect, and she didn't appreciate that. But he should have respected her clear boundaries. Also, she mentioned she didn't like the gentle approach, so if he was doing that despite her telling him, he's not respecting her. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she communicated her preferences and he didn't adhere, he might be at fault. But she also didn't communicate effectively in the moment. She told him to stop but then left without a conversation. Maybe she's not in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundaries, but her reaction could be seen as harsh. However, given her history, her discomfort is understandable. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't respect them. But I need to check if there's more nuance. The boyfriend might have assumed she wanted more connection, but she clearly didn't. So the main issue is his not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
