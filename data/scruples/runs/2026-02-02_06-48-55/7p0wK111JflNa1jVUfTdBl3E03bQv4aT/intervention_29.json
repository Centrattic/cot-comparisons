(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship and finds that rough sex helps her let go, while gentle, connected sex makes her anxious. Last time, he wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle things like kissing her body and playing with her hair, which she disliked. She told him to stop, he stopped but tried other cutesy things, she got mad, put clothes on, and left. She hasn't answered his messages. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I have to decide between A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider communication. She told him her preferences beforehand. That's good. He then tried to do something she didn't like, and she told him to stop. He stopped but tried other things she didn't like. She then left. So, she communicated her discomfort, but he continued with other actions that were still unwanted. She's within her rights to be upset if he didn't respect her boundaries after she told him. \n\nHer history of abuse is relevant. Past trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. If she's honest about her needs due to trauma, it's important for her partner to respect that. However, if she's not communicating clearly or if her partner is trying to adjust and she's not giving feedback, that could be a problem. But in this case, she did tell him she didn't like it, he stopped but tried other things. She then left.\n\nIs she in the wrong for getting angry? If he was not respecting her boundaries after she told him, her reaction is justified. But if she didn't give him enough chance to adjust, maybe not. But the key here is that she had communicated her preferences, and he didn't fully respect them. She's reacting to his continued actions despite her objections. Her leaving might be abrupt, but not necessarily wrong. Also, not responding to messages could be seen as cutting off communication, but if she's upset and needs space, that's understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, if he was trying to adjust to her preferences but she didn't give him feedback, maybe there's a communication gap. But the scenario says she told him to stop when he did things she didn't like. So she did communicate her disapproval. \n\nSo considering all that, she's not in the wrong. She communicated her boundaries, he didn't fully respect them, she's reacting to his actions. Therefore, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
