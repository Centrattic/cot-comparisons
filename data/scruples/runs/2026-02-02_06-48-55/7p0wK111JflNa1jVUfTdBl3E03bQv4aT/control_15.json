(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. When he tried to be gentle, she got uncomfortable, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did tell him her preferences beforehand, so he should have been aware. The boyfriend's actions might not align with her needs, even if he didn't realize. She felt uncomfortable and expressed that during the interaction. It's important to note that prior communication is a key factor here because it shows she made her boundaries clear.\n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave. While leaving abruptly might seem harsh, it's a response to discomfort. Given her history of abuse, her need for specific types of sex (rough) to feel okay is understandable. However, she might need to communicate more effectively about what she needs in the moment, not just her dislikes.\n\nThe boyfriend might need to adjust his approach by being more attentive to her real-time cues. But the author isn't wrong for reacting to something that was communicated to her. She's in a valid position because she's following up on her stated preferences. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
