(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex, which made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The user (21F) mentioned she told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which is unusual but explained by her past abuse. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. The boyfriend, when asked about \"normal\" sex, ended up being gentle and affectionate, which she didn't like. She got mad, told him to stop, left, and hasn't responded to messages. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nSo, the key points are communication and mutual consent. The woman communicated her preferences upfront, so the boyfriend might not have followed through with what she asked for. However, after the fact, she reacted strongly by getting angry and cutting off communication. The boyfriend might have tried to adjust, but perhaps the approach wasn't aligned with her needs. The woman's reaction could be seen as justified if he ignored her preferences, but if he was trying to be gentle for another reason, maybe she overreacted.\n\nBut since she had already communicated her preferences, the boyfriend's actions might not align with her needs, leading to her frustration. However, her response of getting angry and leaving, then not responding, could be seen as dismissive or harsh. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since she communicated her needs and he didn't meet them, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But her reaction might be extreme. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the context of past trauma affecting her preferences, her needs are valid. If the boyfriend didn't respect those boundaries after being told, he's in the wrong. But if he was trying to be considerate and she still reacted negatively, maybe she's not wrong. It's complicated. The answer might be B, she's not in the wrong because her preferences were communicated, and his actions didn't align with them. Her reaction is a result of discomfort and past trauma, which is valid.\n"
