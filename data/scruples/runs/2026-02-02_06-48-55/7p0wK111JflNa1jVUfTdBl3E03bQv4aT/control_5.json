(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for getting mad at their boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author (21F) mentions she told her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. Then, when they had sex, he was being gentle, doing \"normal\" stuff like kissing and playing with her hair, which made her uncomfortable. She told him to stop, got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo the key points here are communication and boundaries. She had already communicated her preferences to him. If he didn't heed her boundaries, that's a problem. But he did stop when she told him. He tried to do cutesy things, but she told him again to stop. Then she left. But she hasn't answered his messages, which might be part of the issue.\n\nWait, the boyfriend said he wanted \"normal\" sex. Maybe he misunderstood what she meant by her preferences. But she had told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate, so \"normal\" might be in conflict with her needs. He might not have adjusted properly. However, when she told him to stop, he did stop, so maybe he was trying to comply but didn't get it right.\n\nOn her part, she got mad and left, which could be seen as an overreaction if he was trying to adjust. But considering her trauma, she might have valid reasons for her discomfort. She's trying to set boundaries based on her past, which he was aware of. If he didn't respect her boundaries, even after she told him, then she's justified in her reaction.\n\nBut maybe she should have communicated more clearly during the encounter instead of getting angry. However, given her history, it's possible she felt triggered and couldn't express it calmly. Also, the fact that she left and hasn't responded might make it seem like she's being unfair, but he might have been trying to accommodate her and failed.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for getting mad. If he didn't follow her instructions, she's not wrong. If he did try and she still got mad, maybe she's in the wrong. But the scenario says he kept trying cutesy things after she told him to stop. So he didn't fully respect her boundaries. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for being upset. She had communicated her needs, and he didn't follow them. Her reaction is a response to him not respecting her boundaries, so she's justified.\n"
