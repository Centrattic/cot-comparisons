(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21F) getting upset with her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable due to past abuse. She prefers rough sex as it helps her let go and have fun. Last night, he wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like body kisses and playing with her hair. She told him to stop, got mad, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author had already communicated her preferences to her boyfriend. That's a key point. If she clearly stated her dislikes and boundaries, he should have respected them. However, he proceeded with actions she found uncomfortable. That suggests he didn't fully heed her boundaries, which might be his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have misinterpreted what \"normal\" sex meant. Maybe he thought \"normal\" was different from what the author intended. Or perhaps he had his own preferences and didn't realize how important rough sex was to her. But since she had told him before, he should have been aware. \n\nHer reaction: she got mad, told him to stop, and left. That seems like a reasonable response if her boundaries were violated. She didn't engage in further communication, which might be because she's still upset. But was her anger justified? Since she had communicated her needs and he didn't respect them, her anger could be seen as a valid reaction to boundary violations. \n\nThe fact that she has a history of abuse complicates things. Past trauma can affect how someone experiences intimacy. If she's in a safe relationship now, she should feel comfortable expressing her needs. However, if the boyfriend isn't meeting those needs without clear communication, he might be at fault. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual communication. Maybe the boyfriend felt he was trying to connect in a different way, and if she had discussed her trauma in more detail, he might understand. However, she did tell him her preferences, so he should have adjusted. \n\nIs she wrong for being upset? If he disregarded her stated boundaries, then she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might be at fault for not following through. But if \"normal\" sex was his way of connecting and she didn't want that, then it's a mismatch in expectations. However, since she communicated her needs, he should have respected them. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries and the boyfriend didn't respect them, leading to her justified anger. Answer B.\n"
