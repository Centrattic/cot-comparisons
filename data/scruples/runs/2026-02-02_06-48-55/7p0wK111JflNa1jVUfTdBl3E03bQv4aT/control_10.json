(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have discussed their preferences. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. Last night, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. She got upset when he was too gentle, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong (AITA?).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She communicated her preferences beforehand. He didn't follow through, which led to her discomfort. She reacted by getting angry and leaving. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she did express her needs. But maybe he misunderstood what \"normal\" meant. However, after she told him she didn't like it, he continued with cutesy stuff, which might have been dismissive of her boundaries. Her reaction was to leave, which is a valid response to discomfort, especially given her history.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If he was respecting her previous communication, he should have adjusted. If he didn't, that's his fault. Her reaction is within her rights to set boundaries. However, maybe she could have communicated more during the act instead of getting angry. But given her trauma, her response makes sense. The boyfriend might need to be more attentive to her current signals rather than relying on past conversations. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
