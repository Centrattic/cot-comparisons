(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's dating a 26-year-old man. They've been together a few months and have sex regularly. She mentioned that she told him before she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. \n\nIn the situation, she says he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which I guess he took as gentle. He started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but then he kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, she communicated her preferences beforehand. He might not have fully understood \"normal\" as being gentle, but he did start doing things she didn't like. When she told him to stop, he stopped but then continued with other actions she didn't like. She got upset and left. \n\nHer reaction could be justified because she was clear about her boundaries. He didn't respect her when she told him to stop after the first time. Maybe he thought he could adjust, but she felt uncomfortable again. She left because she couldn't handle it, which is her right. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he was trying to be affectionate and didn't realize she was still uncomfortable. But since she had a history and told him her preferences, he should have adjusted. Her getting mad is a reaction to her discomfort, not just being difficult. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and he didn't follow through after she asked him to stop. He might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, answer B.\n"
