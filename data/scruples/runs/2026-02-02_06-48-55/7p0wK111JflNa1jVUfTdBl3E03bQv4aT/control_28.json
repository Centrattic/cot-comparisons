(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're at fault for getting angry at their boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author mentioned they have a history of being in an abusive relationship. She told her boyfriend beforehand that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; she prefers rougher sex to feel comfortable. Now, during their latest encounter, the boyfriend tried to be \"normal,\" which involved gentle actions like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She didn't like it, told him to stop, got angry, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nSo, the key points here: she communicated her preferences before, the boyfriend didn't follow through, she got upset, and now they're not talking. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom what I know about healthy relationships, communication is crucial. The author did communicate her needs, which is a good step. The boyfriend, however, might not have respected her boundaries if he knew her preferences and still went ahead with what she disliked. But maybe there's a misunderstanding. He might have meant \"normal\" as something different from what she expected. However, she did tell him she didn't like it, and he kept trying, which could be a problem. \n\nHer reaction of getting mad and leaving could be a natural response to being uncomfortable and having her needs ignored. But is anger the right approach? It might depend on how they usually handle conflicts. Also, not responding to messages might be seen as avoiding the issue. \n\nBut considering her history of abuse, her sensitivity to gentle touch makes sense. Her needs are valid, even if they're different from others. The boyfriend's actions might have been a violation of her established boundaries, which she had communicated. So, maybe the boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her boundaries after she explained her preferences. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that her needs aren't being met, which is understandable. However, the way she handled it (leaving and not communicating) might not be the healthiest approach. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the healthiest approach. \n\nSince she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't adhere to them, she's not in the wrong for getting upset. The boyfriend should have respected her boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
