(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The author mentioned they had talked about their preferences beforehand. She doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship, and she prefers rough sex. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, wanted to be gentle, which made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. She did communicate her preferences initially, which is good. But maybe she didn't clarify enough about how important it is to her. The boyfriend tried to be gentle, which she found uncomfortable. She told him to stop, which is her right. However, she left abruptly and stopped responding, which could be seen as dismissive.\n\nHer past trauma with abuse might affect her current preferences, and that's valid. But does that make her right to get angry? She expressed her discomfort, but the way she handled it might have been harsh. The boyfriend might feel hurt by her reaction. However, she has a legitimate reason based on her past. It's a balance between her needs and his approach. Since she communicated her preferences upfront, the boyfriend might have needed to adjust more. But when he tried to be gentle, she didn't handle the situation calmly. So, maybe both have some responsibility here, but the main issue is whether she's in the wrong. Since she communicated her needs and then reacted strongly, perhaps she's not in the wrong because her preferences are valid, but she could improve communication.\n"
