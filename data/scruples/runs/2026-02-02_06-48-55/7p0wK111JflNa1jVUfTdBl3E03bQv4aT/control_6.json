(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about their boyfriend being too gentle during sex, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they had a conversation about preferences beforehand. They told him they don't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma. So, the boyfriend was aware of this. But when he tried to be gentle, she got uncomfortable and left. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author communicated her needs, but the boyfriend's actions didn't align with those preferences. However, when she told him to stop, he kept trying cutesy things. She then got mad and left. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she had the right to express her boundaries. But maybe she could have handled it differently. However, since her previous abuse caused this issue, it's a valid reason for her discomfort. The boyfriend not respecting her boundaries when she asked him to stop could be his fault. But the user is asking if the author is wrong. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014getting upset and leaving\u2014might be a reaction to her trauma. She might not be at fault for having those feelings, especially since she communicated them. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries after she asked him to stop. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's responsibility. Since she communicated her needs and then confronted him when he didn't respect them, she's not necessarily in the wrong. Her reaction is a result of her past, which is valid. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
