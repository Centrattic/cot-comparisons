(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author (21F) and her boyfriend (26M) having a disagreement about the gentleness during sex. The author previously told him she doesn't like it too gentle or passionate because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex, while he opted for a more gentle approach, leading to her getting mad and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author communicated her preferences upfront. That's important because open communication is a cornerstone of healthy relationships, especially regarding intimate matters. She mentioned her past trauma, which might influence her current preferences. On the other hand, the boyfriend tried to adjust but his approach made her uncomfortable again. She then expressed her discomfort, he tried to stop but continued with cutesy gestures, leading to her leaving.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author did communicate her needs, but maybe the boyfriend's actions were a misunderstanding or a different interpretation of \"normal\" sex. The boyfriend might have been trying to be considerate, but it still clashed with her preferences. However, the author did confront him and told him to stop. The boyfriend didn't listen entirely, as he kept trying, which could be a point against him. But the author left abruptly, didn't respond to messages, which might be seen as her being inconsiderate as well.\n\nAnother angle: She had a past abusive relationship, so her trauma could make rough sex a way to feel in control. The boyfriend's gentle approach might trigger her discomfort. But he also has the right to his own comfort level. The fact that she left and hasn't responded could be seen as her not addressing the issue calmly. Maybe she should have discussed it further instead of walking out. Alternatively, if he wasn't respecting her clear boundaries, then he's at fault. But the story says he stopped when she asked but then kept doing cutesy things, which might not be the same as ignoring her boundaries entirely. \n\nSo, the author communicated her needs, but then reacted strongly when his approach still made her uncomfortable. She might be in the right for setting boundaries, but the way she handled the situation (leaving and not responding) could be seen as her being in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since she did communicate and tried to address the issue, maybe she's not the one at fault. The boyfriend might have misinterpreted her preferences. But the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping. Hmm.\n"
