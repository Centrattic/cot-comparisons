(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. So the situation is that she's 21, he's 26, they've been dating a few months. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. Last night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. When she told him to stop, he kept doing cutesy things, so she got mad, put on clothes, and left. She hasn't replied to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. She had already communicated her preferences to him. If he knew she didn't like gentle and wanted rough, but then proceeded to do the gentle stuff anyway, that's a problem. The fact that she had to tell him to stop again suggests he wasn't respecting her boundaries. Her getting mad is a reaction to his not respecting her boundaries, which is understandable. However, leaving abruptly and not responding might be a communication issue. But the main point is whether she's in the wrong for getting upset. Since he wasn't following her boundaries despite prior communication, her reaction is justified. The boyfriend should have respected her preferences. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
