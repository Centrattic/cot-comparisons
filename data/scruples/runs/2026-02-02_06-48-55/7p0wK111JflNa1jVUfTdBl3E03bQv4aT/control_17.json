(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 21F and her 26M boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him she doesn't like it when sex is too gentle or passionate because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, while gentle or emotionally connecting sex makes her uncomfortable.\n\nLast time, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying cutesy things. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's not responding to his messages and is asking if she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She had previously communicated her preferences. The boyfriend, however, tried to do something different despite her clear communication. She reacted by leaving and not responding. The question is whether her reaction was wrong.\n\nFirst, did the boyfriend overstep? If she had told him she didn't like gentle or passionate sex, and he proceeded to do that anyway, even after she told him to stop, that's a problem. He should respect her boundaries. So maybe he's at fault here. But then, her reaction: getting mad and leaving, not responding\u2014does that make her in the wrong? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She expressed her discomfort, and he didn't respect it. Her action of leaving might be a reaction to her discomfort, which is understandable given her past. However, not responding to his messages could be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't ideal. But considering the context of her trauma, maybe her reaction is justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be trying to connect emotionally, which is a common aspect of intimacy, but she has specific needs due to her history. It's possible he didn't take her boundaries seriously enough, leading to her frustration. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she set clear boundaries and the boyfriend didn't respect them. Her reaction, while perhaps abrupt, stems from valid reasons related to her trauma. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
