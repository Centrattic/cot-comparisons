(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The author is a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had previously discussed her preferences, specifying that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She finds rough sex more comfortable, but her boyfriend's gentle approach makes her uncomfortable, leading her to get angry and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did tell her boyfriend her preferences beforehand. That's a good step. However, the boyfriend might not have fully understood or remembered her specific needs. He tried to engage in gentle, affectionate acts, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, which shows she communicated her discomfort again. \n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave. He tried to make the situation \"normal\" but didn't account for her specific needs. Her past trauma is a key factor here. People's sexual preferences can be deeply influenced by their history, and her current discomfort is a valid response given her background.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions might be seen as not respecting her boundaries, even if he tried to stop after she told him. The author's anger and leaving could be a reaction to not feeling heard or respected, which isn't necessarily her fault. On the other hand, communicating clearly and being patient is important for both sides. Maybe she could have explained more why she was uncomfortable, but she did state her preferences initially. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She communicated her needs, and he didn't follow through. Her reaction, while maybe intense, stems from valid reasons related to her past. The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her boundaries despite prior discussions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
