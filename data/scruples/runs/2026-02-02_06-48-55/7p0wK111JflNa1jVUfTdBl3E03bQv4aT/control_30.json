(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves past trauma from an abusive relationship, which influences her current preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned they had discussed their likes and dislikes before. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past. Now, when he tries to be gentle, she gets uncomfortable and leaves. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her boundaries clearly beforehand. Her reaction is based on her past experiences. However, when he tried to follow her preferences, she got upset. But wait, she said she doesn't like gentle sex. If he's being gentle, and she's telling him to stop, that's confusing. Maybe she wants rough sex, but he's not doing that. Wait, she mentioned she likes rough sex when she can \"let go,\" but when it's gentle, she gets uncomfortable. So maybe the problem is her boyfriend isn't meeting her needs, but she's also not communicating what she actually wants. But in the scenario, he's being gentle, which she said she doesn't like. So why is she mad at him for being gentle? Unless she meant that she doesn't want gentle but also doesn't want passionate? Or maybe she's okay with rough but not with gentle. \n\nWait, the user says she told him she doesn't like sex feeling too gentle or passionate. Wait, that's conflicting. If she doesn't like both, then she's in a tricky spot. But that might not be possible. How can sex not be either gentle or passionate? Maybe she wants something in between? Or maybe she meant she doesn't like when it's too gentle or too passionate. The original statement says she told him she doesn't like it to feel too gentle or passionate. That's a bit unclear. Maybe she prefers a balance? Or maybe she wants rough or normal, but not gentle. \n\nBut in this case, the boyfriend is trying to do \"normal\" sex, which in her context might not be rough. She told him to stop being gentle. So if he's being gentle, which she said she doesn't like, she's upset. But then she leaves and doesn't respond. That seems contradictory. She said she doesn't like gentle, but when he's being gentle, she's upset. Wait, no, she should be upset if he's being gentle because she doesn't like that. But maybe she's confused. Maybe she actually wants rough, but he's not doing that. So she's mad at him for not being rough enough, but she didn't communicate that clearly. \n\nBut she did mention that in the abusive relationship, rough sex helps her. So perhaps she needs rough sex, but the boyfriend is not doing that. However, in the scenario, he's being gentle, which she said she doesn't like. So if she told him that, then why is she upset? Unless he's not doing what she wants. Wait, maybe the problem is that she told him she doesn't like gentle, but he's still being gentle, so she's upset. So she's in the right to be upset because he's not following her boundaries. But she didn't like the gentle stuff and told him to stop, but he kept trying to be gentle. Then she left. But then, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe she's not communicating clearly. If she wants rough sex, she should tell him. But in the original communication, she mentioned not liking gentle or passionate. So maybe she's in a bind. Also, considering trauma, it's important to acknowledge that. But the boyfriend might not know what she actually needs. The author might be in the right because she communicated her boundaries, and he's not following them. However, if she's getting mad at him for following her instructions, that's confusing. Wait, no. Wait, she told him she doesn't like gentle. He starts being gentle, she tells him to stop. He stops but keeps doing cutesy things. She gets mad. So maybe she's in the right because he's not respecting her preferences. But she's also not giving him clear guidance on what she wants. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's not in the wrong because he's not meeting her needs. But is she overreacting? If she's upset because he's being gentle, but he's already stopped, maybe she's being unreasonable. However, given her history, it's understandable. The problem is that the boyfriend might not be able to adjust if she's not clear. Maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she's not communicating clearly. \n\nBut the key points are: she communicated her preferences, he's not following them, she's getting upset because he's doing what she said she doesn't like, and she's leaving. Considering her trauma, her reaction is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
