(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 21-year-old woman, is upset with her boyfriend, a 26-year-old man, because he was too gentle during sex. She mentioned that they had previously talked about their preferences, and she had told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex\u2014it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship and found that rough sex helps her relax, whereas gentle sex makes her anxious.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and consent. The author had already communicated her preferences. The boyfriend, however, tried to be gentle and affectionate, even after she told him she didn't like it. He stopped when she first said so but then continued with cutesy actions. She got mad, put on her clothes, and left. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, communication is crucial in relationships, especially regarding sex. Since she had already shared her boundaries, the boyfriend should have respected them. If he didn't take her feedback seriously and continued after she asked him to stop, that's a problem. Her reaction of getting angry and leaving might be an overreaction, but considering her past trauma, it's understandable. She's dealing with emotional and psychological effects from abuse, which might make her more sensitive to certain behaviors.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be trying to be affectionate and build emotional connection, which is important in a relationship. But if that affection is not wanted and she's clearly communicated that, then it's his responsibility to respect her boundaries. The fact that he kept trying after she told him to stop suggests he didn't take her comfort level seriously, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. She followed up by not responding to his messages, which could be seen as cutting off communication without addressing the issue. However, she might need time to process her feelings, especially given her history. The boyfriend should have considered her past and adjusted his approach without making her feel like she has to leave the situation.\n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries after she communicated them. The author's reaction is a result of her trauma and her attempt to protect herself. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend didn't honor her boundaries, and her response is a consequence of her past experiences.\n"
