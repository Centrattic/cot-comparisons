(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman is 21, her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him upfront that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, it makes her uncomfortable. She mentioned her past abusive relationship, and that she prefers rough sex to feel like she can let go. Last night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved gentle actions like kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he kept trying cute things, she got mad, put clothes on, and left. Now she's not replying and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether she is. \n\nHmm. Communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sex. She did communicate her preferences to him. He, however, didn't respect her boundaries when she told him to stop. Even if he thought his approach was normal, she had already communicated that it wasn't what she wanted. His persistence after she asked to stop could be problematic. \n\nBut wait, she got mad and left, didn't respond. Is that inconsiderate? Well, she left because she was uncomfortable. However, not responding to messages might be seen as avoiding the issue. But given her trauma, maybe she's dealing with it. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have thought he was being affectionate, but he didn't listen to her when she asked to stop. That's a breach of her boundaries. She has the right to set those boundaries, especially after sharing her past. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for getting upset. Since she communicated her needs, and he didn't respect them, she's not in the wrong. He should have respected her boundaries. The fact that she left might be a reaction, but given her history, it's part of her coping. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
