(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The author is a 21-year-old female who's upset because her boyfriend was too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their likes and dislikes beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable. She attributes this to her past in an abusive relationship, where rough sex helps her let go and have fun. The boyfriend, after she told him she didn't like the gentle approach, tried to do cutesy things, and she got mad, left, and hasn't responded to messages.\n\nSo, the key points are: communication was done upfront, the author has a history that affects her preferences, and the boyfriend tried to adjust but she got upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. \n\nFirst, considering communication. The author did communicate her preferences, which is a good step. However, maybe she didn't explain the reasons behind her preferences (like her past abuse) clearly enough. But she did mention it in the post. The boyfriend might not have fully understood the importance of her needs or how to adjust properly. \n\nThen there's the reaction. She told him to stop, and he stopped, but kept trying different things. She got mad and left. Is that justified? If she explicitly told him she didn't like it and he kept doing things she didn't want, maybe she has a right to be upset. However, the way she handled it\u2014leaving and not responding\u2014could be seen as cutting off communication. \n\nAlso, her past trauma plays a role. If her preferences are based on trauma, it's important for her partner to be sensitive and accommodating. But the boyfriend's approach might have been too slow or not rough enough. Maybe he didn't follow through on her stated preferences. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If she communicated her needs and he didn't meet them adequately, then she's not in the wrong. If he was making an effort but she reacted too harshly without giving him a chance to adjust, maybe she is. However, the boyfriend's actions post-communication are key. He said he wanted \"normal\" sex but then went gentle. Maybe \"normal\" for him was different. But she told him she didn't like it and he kept trying cutesy stuff, which she didn't like. So, he didn't respect her boundaries after she told him. In that case, she's not in the wrong. But she left without addressing it properly, which might be seen as her fault in terms of handling the situation.\n\nWait, the boyfriend said he wanted \"normal\" sex, which might imply something different than what she wanted. Maybe there was a miscommunication. She thought rough sex was needed, but he thought \"normal\" was gentle. That's a misunderstanding. If he didn't adjust to her rough needs, then she's justified. But she got angry and left, not giving him a chance to adjust further. So maybe both sides have some responsibility. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she communicated her needs and he didn't meet them, she's not in the wrong. If she overreacted by leaving, maybe she is. But given her trauma history, her reaction might be understandable. However, cutting off communication is not productive. \n\nThe user initially thought she's in the wrong, but considering all factors, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). She communicated her needs, he didn't adjust properly, and her reaction, while abrupt, is a result of her trauma. So she's not in the wrong.\n"
