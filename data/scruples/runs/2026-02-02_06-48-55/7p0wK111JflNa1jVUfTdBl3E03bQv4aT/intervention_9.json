(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the 21F) is in the wrong here. The situation is about her getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned that she had already communicated her preferences, that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abuse. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. \n\nHer boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being gentle and doing things like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She got upset, told him to stop, and left. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She said they talked about likes and dislikes before, and she expressed her discomfort with gentle sex. So she did her part in communicating. But when the boyfriend tried to be gentle, she was unhappy. Now, the key point here is whether the boyfriend overstepped despite the prior communication. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The boyfriend might have misunderstood \"normal\" sex. Maybe he thought \"normal\" meant his usual way, not considering her specific needs. But she had already told him she doesn't like gentle, so why did he proceed? Maybe he wasn't paying attention to her signals or didn't adjust after she expressed discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, she got angry and left without addressing it properly. She mentioned she hasn't replied to his messages. Maybe she should have had a calm conversation instead of storming off. But given her past, her reaction might stem from trauma. It's a sensitive situation where both parties might have valid points. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she did communicate her preferences, but maybe she could have handled the situation better. However, the boyfriend should have respected her boundaries. The fact that she left him alone with messages might not be the best approach, but does that make her wrong? \n\nAlternatively, the boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her prior communication. But then she reacted harshly. It's a bit of a toss-up. The initial communication is clear, but the response to the situation could be better from both sides. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But considering the context of her past abuse and clear communication, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. The boyfriend should have adjusted his behavior based on her preferences. But her reaction of getting angry and leaving without discussion could be seen as not handling it maturely. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs, and the boyfriend didn't follow through. But I'm a bit conflicted. The key is whether the boyfriend disregarded her communication, which would make him at fault. If that's the case, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author's anger was disproportionate, then she might be. Given the trauma context, it's more likely that the boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her boundaries, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
