(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple having sex where the girl (21F) told her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of a past abusive relationship. Now, when he tries to be gentle, she gets mad and leaves. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She mentioned their communication beforehand about her preferences. She has a history of abuse, which affects how she feels about certain types of intimacy. He tried to be gentle, which she said she doesn't like, but when he stopped, he still did cutesy things, making her uncomfortable. She then left.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she communicated her boundaries and he didn't respect them, even after she told him to stop, then maybe he's in the wrong. However, after she asked him to stop, he might have thought he was adjusting, but she still felt uncomfortable and left. She's also not responding to his messages, which could be seen as cutting off communication.\n\nBut looking at the communication aspect, she did tell him before. He might have thought he was being considerate, but perhaps he didn't fully understand her needs. However, when she said to stop, he kept trying, which could be a breach of her boundaries. Her reaction of getting mad and leaving is a response to him not respecting her limits, which she already communicated. So she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend should have respected her preferences more clearly. Also, the fact that she has a past that affects this adds context to why her reaction is valid. The answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
