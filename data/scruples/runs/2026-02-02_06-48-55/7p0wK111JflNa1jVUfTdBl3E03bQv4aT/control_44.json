(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they had talked about their preferences beforehand. She specifically told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. So she communicated her needs clearly. That's important because communication is key in relationships.\n\nThen, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which the author interpreted as too gentle. He tried to be affectionate with kisses and playing with her hair, which she didn't like. She told him to stop and got angry, then left. Now she's questioning if she's at fault.\n\nThe user wants to know if AITA (Am I the Asshole). The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend might have misunderstood what \"normal\" meant, but the author had already set boundaries. If he respected her preferences, he should have adjusted. However, if he felt his approach was based on prior communication, maybe there's a miscommunication. But the author had a history of abuse making rough sex more comfortable for her. The boyfriend's actions made her uncomfortable again, so her reaction could be justified. \n\nAlso, she told him to stop and he kept trying to be affectionate, which led to her anger. She left without responding to his messages. Was her reaction proportionate? Well, she was clear about her discomfort and then left, which might be a valid response if he wasn't respecting her boundaries. But maybe she could have handled it differently without leaving. However, given her trauma history, her feelings are valid. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If he didn't adhere to her communicated preferences, that's his fault. But she reacted by ignoring him. However, given her past and the situation, she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
