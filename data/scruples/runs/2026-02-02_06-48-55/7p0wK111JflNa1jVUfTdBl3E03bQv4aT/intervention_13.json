(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves previous communication about preferences.\n\nSo, the author, a 21F, told her boyfriend upfront that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it's uncomfortable. She has a history of abuse, which affects her current preferences. Her boyfriend, 26M, tried to be gentle and cutesy, leading to her anger and leaving.\n\nHmm, communication is key here. She did tell him her boundaries. If he respected that, he should have adjusted. But he kept doing things she didn't like. So maybe he's partly at fault for not listening. But she reacted by getting mad and leaving without addressing it properly. Maybe she could have communicated better in the moment instead of just leaving. However, considering her past trauma, her reaction might be valid. The boyfriend might not understand her trauma's impact. \n\nOn the other hand, she did express her preferences clearly, so the onus is on him to follow through. But she also didn't give him a chance to adjust after the initial complaint. Maybe he was trying to be considerate but didn't realize it was still bothering her. \n\nSo, is she at fault? Well, she followed through on her stated preferences, even if the method was abrupt. Her trauma is a significant factor. The boyfriend's persistence in doing what she asked him to stop might make him partly at fault. The author's reaction, while perhaps extreme, is based on her communicated needs. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
