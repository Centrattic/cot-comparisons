(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for getting angry at their boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves their communication of preferences and the boyfriend's response.\n\nFirst, the author (21F) mentioned to her boyfriend (26M) that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. They've been dating a few months and have been having sex regularly. \n\nIn the recent incident, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which the author interpreted as gentle. She didn't like the kisses and cutesy stuff, got mad, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nKey points to consider: Did she communicate her preferences clearly before? Yes, she did. The boyfriend tried to adjust, but maybe he misunderstood or didn't take her boundaries seriously. When she told him to stop, he kept doing things she didn't like. That's a problem. Her reaction was to get angry and leave. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend might have thought his actions were consensual. However, since she had already communicated her discomfort and he continued, he might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. The author's anger stems from her valid need based on past trauma. She's not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have been more communicative in the moment instead of just leaving. But given her history, her reaction isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's persistence after being told to stop is a bigger issue here. The author isn't at fault for getting mad; she's protecting her comfort and safety. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
