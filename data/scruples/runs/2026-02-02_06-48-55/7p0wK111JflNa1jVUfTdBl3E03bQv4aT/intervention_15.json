(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they've been dating a few months and had sex regularly. She already communicated her preferences: she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship and finds rough sex more comfortable, which helps her let go. The boyfriend, during a recent encounter, wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle actions like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying these things, leading her to get mad, put her clothes on, and leave. She hasn't responded to his messages since.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess whether that's accurate. Let's consider communication. The author had already told him her preferences. The boyfriend might not have fully understood what \"normal\" meant in her context. But he did stop when she said she didn't like it. However, he continued with other cutesy actions, which she didn't like either. So, maybe he wasn't fully respecting her boundaries after she spoke up.\n\nHer reaction: getting mad and leaving. She didn't communicate further, just left. She also hasn't answered his messages. Is that wrong? Well, she did express her discomfort, but maybe her approach could have been more constructive. However, given her trauma history, her reaction might be a result of that. The boyfriend might not have realized that his actions were triggering her, even if he stopped at first but then continued. Maybe he should have listened more carefully and adjusted completely. \n\nBut also, after she told him to stop, he kept trying other things. Maybe he didn't take her feedback seriously enough. The author's reaction could be a result of her discomfort, but leaving without communication might not be the best approach. However, considering her history, maybe she's not in the wrong for feeling that way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend was supposed to respect her boundaries and stopped at first but then kept doing other things, maybe he's at fault. But the author's response of getting angry and not communicating might not be ideal. However, given her trauma, her reaction is understandable. \n\nThe key points are communication and respecting boundaries. If the author had communicated her needs clearly, and the boyfriend didn't fully comply, he might be at fault. But if she overreacted without addressing the issue properly, maybe she's in the wrong. \n\nBut considering she had already communicated her preferences, and the boyfriend didn't fully respect them after she told him to stop, the fault might lie with the boyfriend. However, the author's reaction of leaving and not communicating further is also a problem. \n\nHmm. The author's history is important here. Her trauma might influence her reactions, making her more sensitive. The boyfriend might not have realized that even after stopping one action, other gentle actions were still problematic. \n\nIn terms of the question of whether she's in the wrong, maybe not. She was clear, and he didn't adjust properly. But her response was abrupt. However, given the context of her trauma, it's a complex situation. The answer might not be black and white, but the options are A or B. \n\nI think the key is whether she's wrong for getting mad. Since she had communicated her preferences and he didn't fully respect them, her reaction could be justified. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
