(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author is 21F, her boyfriend is 26M. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She mentioned before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma (abusive relationship). She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable, while gentle makes her anxious. \n\nThe situation: The boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being more gentle\u2014kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She didn't like it, told him to stop, he stopped but kept trying, leading her to get mad and leave, then ignore his messages.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had previously communicated her preferences. The boyfriend might not have fully understood her needs, especially considering her trauma. But he did try to adjust after she asked him to stop. However, he kept doing cutesy things, which made her upset. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate. If she had already communicated her boundaries and the boyfriend didn't respect them after being told, then he's at fault. But in this case, she says he stopped when she asked but then continued with other actions. Maybe she didn't clearly communicate her discomfort again, or he misinterpreted her preferences. \n\nAlso, her reaction\u2014getting mad and leaving\u2014is a valid response if her boundaries were violated. The fact that she has trauma complicates things. It's possible that her needs are specific, and the boyfriend needs to be more accommodating. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If she clearly communicated her needs and he kept doing things she didn't like despite her objections, then she's not wrong for being upset. However, maybe she could have handled it better by discussing it calmly instead of getting angry. But given her trauma, her reaction is understandable. \n\nAlternatively, the boyfriend might have thought he was being attentive, but misread her needs. But since she told him before, it's on him to adjust. The fact that he didn't stop completely after she asked might mean he's not respecting her boundaries, making the author right to be upset. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because she's acting on her communicated boundaries and trauma history. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her preferences after being told.\n"
