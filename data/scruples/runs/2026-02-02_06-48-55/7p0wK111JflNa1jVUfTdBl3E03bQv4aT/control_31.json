(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting mad at their boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The user is a 21-year-old female, and her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She mentions a past abusive relationship and that rough sex helps her feel free, while gentle makes her anxious. Last time, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, she had communicated her preferences beforehand. That's important. If he knew and still went against her wishes, he's at fault. But maybe he misunderstood what \"normal\" meant? However, she said she doesn't like gentle, and he did gentle things. So maybe he didn't adjust properly. She told him to stop, so that's her right. The fact that she has a history of abuse affects her current comfort. The key here is communication. She told him, but he didn't adapt. Her reaction might be strong, but if he wasn't respecting her boundaries, she's justified. However, maybe she could have handled it better, like explaining instead of just leaving. But given her trauma, her response is understandable. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
