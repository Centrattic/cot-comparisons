(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves their communication about preferences and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they discussed their likes and dislikes beforehand. She explicitly told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which makes her uncomfortable due to past trauma. The boyfriend, however, went with a more gentle approach, which upset her. She got angry, told him to stop, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider consent and communication. The author communicated her boundaries, but maybe the boyfriend misunderstood or didn't take them seriously. However, she did tell him, so is he at fault for not respecting that? Or did he try to adjust? He stopped when she asked but kept doing cutesy things. That might not align with her needs. She got angry because he didn't heed her preferences, which is a valid reaction if he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author needs to communicate more clearly. But she did tell him her preferences. The fact that she left and hasn't responded might be part of the issue. But given the trauma context, her reaction is understandable. The boyfriend's actions (normal sex meaning gentle) might not have been what she wanted. So, she's not in the wrong because she followed through on her communication, and he didn't respect her boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
