(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a 21-year-old woman) is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they had discussed their likes and dislikes beforehand. She specifically told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship and finds that rough sex helps her feel better. The boyfriend, when initiating \"normal\" sex, tried gentle actions like kissing her body, playing with her hair, and chaste kisses. She told him to stop, got angry, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication: She clearly communicated her boundaries. He didn't respect those by continuing the actions she asked him to stop. Even if his intention was to be affectionate, her comfort and prior communication should be respected. The fact that she had a past abusive relationship adds context to her sensitivity. Getting upset when someone ignores her boundaries is understandable. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend might have thought \"normal\" sex meant a balance, but he didn't ask for her input again. She did express her preferences earlier. If he continued after she told him to stop, that's a problem. The author's reaction (getting angry and leaving) is a response to him not respecting her boundaries. So, in that case, she might not be in the wrong. However, if she didn't give him a chance to adjust or if her response was excessive, maybe. But given the context, she communicated her needs, he didn't follow, and she reacted. The key here is that consent and respecting boundaries are crucial. If she's in the wrong, it would be if she didn't communicate clearly, but she did. So the boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
