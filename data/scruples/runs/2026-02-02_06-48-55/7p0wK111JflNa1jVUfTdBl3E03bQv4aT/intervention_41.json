(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a relationship where the girl (21F) gets upset with her boyfriend (26M) for not being rough enough during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She told him about her preferences, but when he tried to have \"normal\" sex with gentle touches, she got mad and left. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did tell her boyfriend her preferences beforehand. That's a key point. But maybe the boyfriend tried to adjust but didn't fully understand the depth of her needs. The author then reacted strongly by getting angry and leaving, and hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: he tried to be gentle and connect, which she didn't like. But she had told him her preferences. Maybe he misunderstood what \"normal\" meant here. However, she did ask him to stop when he was doing things she didn't like, so he might not have been aware that his approach was off.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her needs, which is good. But her reaction was to get mad and leave, which could be seen as a harsh response. However, considering her trauma from the abusive relationship, her discomfort is valid. She might struggle with expressing her needs in a way that's comfortable for her. The boyfriend might not have been attentive enough to her boundaries during the interaction, even after she had told him her preferences.\n\nBut the user says the author is in the wrong. The user might think that expressing preferences is one thing, but reacting angrily and cutting off communication is unreasonable. However, the author is dealing with trauma, which affects her reactions. It's possible that she's not in the wrong because her needs are legitimate, and her trauma should be taken into account. The boyfriend's approach might have been too passive, not respecting her preference for rougher sex, but he tried to adjust. But she might not have communicated effectively during the act, beyond initial discussion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author's reaction was too extreme given that she had already communicated her preferences. If she told him and he tried to adjust but still didn't meet her needs, maybe she should have guided him further during the interaction instead of getting mad. However, considering her history, it's possible she's not comfortable with gentle sex and her trauma might make it hard for her to adjust in the moment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she communicated her preferences and the boyfriend still didn't meet them, maybe she's not at fault. But if she didn't clearly communicate during the act and just reacted after, maybe she has some responsibility. It's a nuanced situation. The answer depends on whether the author took enough steps to guide the boyfriend during the interaction. Since she told him previously but didn't stop him when he was doing the gentle things, maybe she's partially at fault. But given her trauma, her reaction is understandable. The boyfriend might need to be more attentive to her cues in the moment, even after prior communication. So perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs and her trauma is valid, but she could have handled the situation better. However, the user thinks she's in the wrong. But according to the analysis, maybe the answer is B.\n"
