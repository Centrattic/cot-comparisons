(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she clearly told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abuse. Now, the boyfriend tried to be gentle, which she found uncomfortable, leading her to get upset and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's in the wrong. She communicated her boundaries, which is important. People have different preferences, and it's okay for her to have specific needs based on her past. However, the boyfriend might have felt hurt or confused because he was trying to be considerate. But given that she had already told him her preferences, it's on him to respect that. She did tell him she didn't like it and he kept doing things she didn't like. So her reaction, while maybe intense, is understandable. The key here is that she had communicated her needs. If he didn't follow through, then she's not in the wrong for being upset. The question is whether she overreacted. Since she had a valid reason based on trauma, it's more about him not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
