(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend when he was too gentle during sex.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they had talked about their likes and dislikes before. The author told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex and that rough sex helps her feel more comfortable. She has a history of being in an abusive relationship, which makes her feel more at ease with rough sex. \n\nThe situation: The boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which the author interprets as gentle. He tried to be affectionate with kisses and touching her hair, which she didn't like. She got mad and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering consent and communication. They had discussed their preferences beforehand. The author made her feelings clear. If he was aware of her preferences and still chose a different approach, that might be his issue. However, maybe he misunderstood \"normal\" sex as something she meant. But she said she doesn't like gentle, so if he went against that, he wasn't respecting her boundaries. Her reaction, while maybe abrupt, is a response to her discomfort, which he didn't respect. She also mentioned she was in an abusive relationship, so her triggers are valid. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend was trying to make it more intimate, and she was uncomfortable. The key is whether he respected her boundaries. If he knew she didn't like gentle and then proceeded anyway, he's at fault. The author's reaction is a result of not feeling respected. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
