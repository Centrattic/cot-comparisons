(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 21, her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She mentioned earlier that she doesn't like sex feeling too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship and finds rough sex more comfortable, as it helps her let go. The boyfriend tried to do something gentle, like kissing her body and playing with her hair, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so she communicated her preferences beforehand. That's important. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. She told him what she didn't like, so if he still tried things she didn't want, maybe he didn't listen properly. But wait, when she told him during the act, he stopped but kept doing other things. Maybe he was trying to be affectionate but didn't realize it was crossing into what she dislikes. But she did tell him to stop, so he might have been confused. \n\nHer reaction was getting mad and leaving. Is that justified? If she had already communicated her boundaries and he tried things she didn't like, then her frustration is understandable. However, maybe she could have handled it differently, like trying to talk it out more calmly instead of leaving immediately. But given her history of abuse, her sensitivity is valid. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's intention to have \"normal\" sex might have meant something different to him. Maybe he thought being gentle was normal or caring. However, the key is that he didn't respect her boundaries once she told him to stop. Even if he was trying to be affectionate, continuing those actions after she asked to stop is a problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't respect them. Her reaction, while maybe intense, comes from a place of established boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
