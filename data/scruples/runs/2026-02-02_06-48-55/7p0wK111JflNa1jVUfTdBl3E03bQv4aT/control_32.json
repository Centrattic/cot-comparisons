(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves the author explaining that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of a past abusive relationship and prefers rough sex. The boyfriend tried to be gentle, she told him to stop, got upset, and left. Now she's not responding to his messages and is asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The author had previously told her boyfriend about her preferences, so he was aware. However, when they had sex again, he went back to a style she doesn't like. That could indicate that maybe he didn't fully understand or respect her boundaries after the initial discussion. On the other hand, the author did tell him to stop during the encounter, but then left without further communication. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions might be a way of showing affection, which could be conflicting with the author's needs. Since she has a history of abuse, her discomfort makes sense. She might need more assertive or rough interactions to feel in control. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for her reaction. \n\nThe key points are: prior communication, her valid reasons (past trauma), and the boyfriend not adhering to her stated preferences. If he knew her boundaries and still tried that approach, he might be at fault for not respecting her earlier statements. However, the author's response of getting angry and leaving without addressing things might be seen as abrupt. \n\nBut given her explanation, her reaction is understandable. She's not wrong for feeling uncomfortable and needing to assert her needs. The boyfriend might need to be more accommodating and check in again to ensure he's respecting her boundaries. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
