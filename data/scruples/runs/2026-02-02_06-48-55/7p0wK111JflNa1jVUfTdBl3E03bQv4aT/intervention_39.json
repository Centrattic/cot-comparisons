(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe situation is about a 21-year-old female and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him she doesn't like it when he's too gentle or passionate because it makes her uncomfortable, especially since she was in an abusive relationship before. She prefers rough sex to \"let go and have fun,\" but gentle, connected sex makes her anxious. Last night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which involved more gentle touches like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept doing cutesy things, she got mad, put on her clothes, and left. Now she's ignoring his messages and asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to decide A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider communication. She did tell him her preferences beforehand. He might not have followed through, but she did communicate her needs. If he didn't heed her boundaries, that's an issue. However, she also reacted by getting mad and leaving, not explaining her feelings. Maybe he didn't understand why his actions were a problem unless she explained it's linked to her past trauma.\n\nHer history with an abusive relationship is important. She might associate gentle, loving actions with the past negative experiences, making her uncomfortable. He, on the other hand, might be trying to be affectionate, not realizing it's triggering for her. She did tell him her preference, but maybe she didn't explain the root cause (the abusive past), so he could be unaware of how his actions affect her.\n\nWhen she told him to stop and then left without further communication, that could come off as abrupt. She might not have given him the chance to adjust or understand her feelings. He might feel hurt or confused, hence why he's messaging her. The key here is whether she communicated effectively. If she had explained her past and how his actions were triggering her, he might have been more understanding. However, she did tell him she doesn't like gentle sex, so he should respect that. But maybe he was trying to be caring, and she's not giving him credit for trying. \n\nAlso, the fact that she left and isn't responding to his messages might be seen as dismissive. Conflict resolution is important in relationships. Not addressing it might make things worse. She could be in the wrong for not handling the situation more openly after the initial communication. Alternatively, if he's not respecting her boundaries despite prior discussion, he's at fault. But the question is about her.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer depends on whether she's the one who overreacted. Since she communicated her preferences, but didn't explain the deeper reason (abuse), and then left without discussing, maybe she's in the wrong for not handling the situation more constructively. However, if he's not following her boundaries, then he's in the wrong. But the question is about her. So, if she's the one who got mad and left without trying to resolve it, that's on her. Also, she might need to explain her trauma to him for better understanding. So, maybe she's in the wrong for not addressing it properly after the initial communication.\n"
