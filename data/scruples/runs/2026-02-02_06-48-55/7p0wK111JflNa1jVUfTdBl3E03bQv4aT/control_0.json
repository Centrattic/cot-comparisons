(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (21F) being upset with her boyfriend (26M) for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. Now, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to her getting mad when he tried gentle stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did tell him her preferences upfront, so she's not at fault for not communicating. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might have misunderstood what \"normal\" meant. Maybe he thought of it as his usual way, not considering her specific needs. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. She got angry and left, not responding to his messages. But given her history, her reaction might be understandable. She's trying to set boundaries, and if he didn't respect them, she's justified in standing up for herself. However, leaving without communication could be seen as a problem. But considering her past trauma, maybe her response is a coping mechanism. It's a balance between respecting her boundaries and addressing how she handled the conflict. I think the key here is that she communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't follow through, so she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
