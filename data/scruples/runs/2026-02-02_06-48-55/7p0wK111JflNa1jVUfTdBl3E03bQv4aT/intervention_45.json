(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves them having discussed preferences beforehand, where she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma. The boyfriend tried to be gentle, she got uncomfortable, told him to stop, then left and hasn't responded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did communicate her preferences, so the boyfriend should have respected that. However, he tried to be gentle anyway, which led to her getting upset. But wait, if she communicated clearly, maybe he didn't take it seriously enough. On the other hand, she got mad and left, not responding. That could be seen as dismissive. But given her history of abuse, her reaction might be a trauma response. \n\nAnother angle: mutual respect in relationships. The boyfriend should adjust his behavior based on her boundaries. If she told him she doesn't like gentle, he should avoid that. However, if he misunderstood \"too rough\" as just not gentle, maybe there's a communication gap. But the key is that she already communicated her needs, so he's at fault for not adhering. Her reaction of getting mad and leaving might be justified given her trauma. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might say she should handle it calmly instead of pulling away. But considering her past, it's a valid reaction. So answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
