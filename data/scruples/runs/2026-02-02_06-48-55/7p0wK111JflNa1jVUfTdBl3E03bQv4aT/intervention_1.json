(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation is about communication and past trauma.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned that she had previously told her boyfriend about her preferences. She doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. The boyfriend, however, went for a more gentle approach, which made her uncomfortable. She got mad, told him to stop, dressed, and left. Now she's not responding to his messages.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are communication and boundaries. She communicated her preferences upfront, which is good. But when the situation happened, she reacted strongly. The boyfriend might have misinterpreted \"normal\" sex. Maybe he thought it meant something different. However, she did tell him she didn't like it and he kept trying to do things she didn't like. But she also left abruptly without explaining further. \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong to react that way. On one hand, she communicated her needs, which is a valid step. On the other hand, her reaction\u2014getting angry, leaving, and not responding\u2014might be seen as cutting off communication. It's possible she could have expressed her feelings without ending the encounter so abruptly. However, considering her past trauma, her discomfort is legitimate. The boyfriend might need to adjust his approach, but the author's response could also be seen as a result of her own boundaries being respected but handled poorly in the moment.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of both. She communicated her needs but didn't handle the conflict well. However, given the context of past trauma, her reaction might be justified. The boyfriend's actions could also be a misstep in understanding her needs. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because her initial communication was correct, and her reaction stems from valid discomfort, even if the handling could improve.\n"
