(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman getting upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She communicated her preferences before, but when he tried to be gentle, she got mad and left. The question is whether she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author did tell her boyfriend her preferences. That's important because it shows she made her needs known. However, when he tried to follow her instructions, she got upset. Maybe he misunderstood what she meant by not wanting gentle. Maybe she wanted more aggressive sex, but he interpreted it as not being too rough. But the problem is that she got angry when he followed her initial communication, which is confusing.\n\nThen there's the aspect of past trauma. She mentions an abusive relationship, so her current preferences are influenced by that. It's possible that her reaction is a result of trauma, which might not be her fault, but how she handles it in the relationship matters. If she communicated her needs and he's trying to meet them, but she still gets upset, maybe there's a deeper issue. However, if her trauma causes her to have conflicting feelings, that's something she and her boyfriend need to navigate together. \n\nAlso, when she told him to stop and then left without responding to his messages, that could be seen as cutting off communication. Even if her feelings are valid, not responding might make it harder for him to understand and adjust. But he might also need to be more sensitive to her triggers, especially given her history.\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect. If she explicitly said she doesn't like gentle sex, he should respect that. But if her reaction is conflicting with what she said, maybe there's a miscommunication. However, her trauma might mean that even when she communicates, her reactions are instinctive. \n\nIn terms of fault, both might share some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she communicated her needs, then she isn't necessarily at fault for getting upset. However, leaving and not communicating afterwards could be seen as her not taking responsibility for her actions. On the other hand, if her trauma causes her to have these reactions, it's not entirely her fault. \n\nThe key points here are communication, trauma response, and mutual effort in the relationship. Since she did communicate her preferences, but her reaction might be a result of trauma, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's not allowing her boyfriend to adjust or is being inconsistent, that's a different story. However, the story doesn't indicate that he was being insensitive; he tried to be gentle as she asked, so if she's still upset, it's more about her trauma than his actions. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because she communicated her needs, and her trauma is a valid reason for her reaction. However, the way she handled the situation (leaving without talking) might not be ideal, but the core issue isn't her fault.\n"
