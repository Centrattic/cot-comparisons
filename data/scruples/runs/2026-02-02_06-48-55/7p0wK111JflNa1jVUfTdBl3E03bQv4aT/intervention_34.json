(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend who have been dating a few months. They talked about their preferences beforehand. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of a past abusive relationship and finds rough sex more comfortable. Last night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle, and she got upset when he tried to be affectionate with kisses and playing with her hair. She told him to stop, put her clothes on, and left. She hasn't responded to his messages.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did communicate her preferences early on, which is good. However, the boyfriend's actions might have been a shift from their prior understanding. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's reaction was to get mad and leave. She did voice her discomfort, which is valid, especially considering her past trauma. The boyfriend's approach changed from what they discussed, which could be a problem. However, the author's response was abrupt\u2014leaving without addressing the issue directly. Did she handle it in a way that could be seen as dismissive or not giving him a chance to adjust? Also, not responding to messages might be seen as avoiding conflict, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not have respected her boundaries if he continued after she asked to stop. The author's past trauma is a significant factor; her need for rough sex is a personal preference shaped by her experiences. The boyfriend's attempt at gentle sex could be a misunderstanding, but he should have been aware of her previous communication.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overreacted. Her feelings are valid given her history, but her response might have been abrupt. The boyfriend might have misread the situation, but he also didn't heed her initial feedback. Both parties have some responsibility here. However, since the author did communicate her preferences and the boyfriend didn't adjust despite her telling him to stop, the blame might not be solely on her. But her leaving without further communication could be seen as unkind. The answer isn't straightforward, but considering the context, maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
