(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she had previously told him about her preference for rough sex because of her past in an abusive relationship. Now, when he tried to be gentle and show affection, she got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The author did communicate her preferences beforehand, so the boyfriend's actions might not have been intentional. However, he might have misunderstood or didn't take her boundaries seriously enough. The key here is whether he respected her input. If she had clearly stated her discomfort with gentle, passionate sex, then his actions could be seen as disregarding her boundaries. But maybe he was trying to be caring, not being too rough.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author has a history of abuse, which affects her current preferences. That's important because past trauma can influence behavior and preferences in intimate relationships. Her reaction might stem from that trauma, which is valid. However, when she got angry and left without much explanation, that could be seen as a problem. Even if her feelings are valid, how she expressed them might have been hurtful to the boyfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's approach might have been too passive or not considering her established boundaries. If he knew she didn't like gentle sex, why was he trying to be gentle? Maybe he didn't take her previous communication seriously, or maybe he was trying to readjust based on different cues. It's possible he thought they were moving towards a more intimate phase, but she wasn't in the mood for that.\n\nAnother angle is mutual respect. Both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she communicated her needs and he still proceeded in a way that made her uncomfortable, that's a problem. But if she got angry without giving him a chance to adjust, that's also an issue. The fact that she left without addressing his messages might indicate she didn't want to resolve the issue, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"normal\" sex is subjective. He might have meant something different by \"normal\" than what she expected. Maybe she thought it meant rougher sex, but he thought it meant a balanced approach. Miscommunication here is possible. The boyfriend's actions after she told him to stop\u2014if he kept trying cutesy things\u2014could indicate he wasn't respecting her immediate boundaries, which would be on him.\n\nBut then again, if the author reacted with anger and left abruptly, that could be seen as her not handling the situation maturely, even if she was upset. It's a balance between respecting her trauma-informed needs and handling conflict constructively. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons based on her past, her reaction might have been inconsiderate. The boyfriend's actions could also be at fault if he didn't take her previous communication seriously. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the focus is on her actions. She did communicate her preferences, but her response was to get angry and leave without much communication. That part might be where she's in the wrong because conflict resolution often involves communication, not immediate withdrawal.\n"
