(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the woman being upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship, and she prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The woman communicated her preferences before, right? She told her boyfriend she doesn't like gentle sex. Then the boyfriend tried to be gentle again, which made her uncomfortable. She got mad, told him to stop, and left. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom what I know about relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, but maybe the boyfriend didn't fully understand or adjust. However, when she told him she didn't like it and he continued with cutesy stuff, that's a problem. She had the right to express her discomfort. \n\nBut the boyfriend's intention was to be gentle, which he might think is normal or caring. However, if the person is uncomfortable with that, he should respect her boundaries. The fact that she had a past abusive relationship might affect her preferences, and it's valid for her to have those needs now. \n\nHer reaction was to get mad and leave, which might seem abrupt, but given her history, it's a way she copes. She didn't respond to his messages, which could be seen as her being inconsiderate, but maybe she needed space. \n\nSo, considering she communicated her needs, the boyfriend didn't adjust adequately, and her reaction was a result of her valid discomfort, it's more likely that the boyfriend is the one not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
