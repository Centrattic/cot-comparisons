(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable because of her past in an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel like she can let go, while gentle sex makes her anxious.\n\nLast night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she interpreted as gentle. When he started doing things like kissing her body and playing with her hair, she told him to stop and got mad, then left. She hasn't responded to his messages. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, communication is key. She had previously communicated her preferences. However, when he misunderstood or chose to ignore them during the encounter, that's a problem. He should have respected her boundaries. But she also got angry and left, which might be seen as a harsh reaction. However, considering her trauma, her discomfort is valid. She has the right to express her needs and set boundaries. His actions after she told him to stop were dismissive of her boundaries, which is a red flag. The fact that she felt she had to leave because he wasn't respecting her preferences suggests a deeper issue. The main issue here is his failure to adhere to the boundaries she had already communicated. Her reaction, while perhaps abrupt, is a response to his disregard for her comfort. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend's actions were the problem. Answer B.\n"
