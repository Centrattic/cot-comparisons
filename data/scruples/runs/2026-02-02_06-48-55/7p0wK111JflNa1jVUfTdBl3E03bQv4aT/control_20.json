(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 21-year-old woman) is in the wrong for getting angry at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. The boyfriend is 26, and they've been dating a few months. The key points here are communication and consent.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned that she had already communicated her preferences to her boyfriend. She specifically told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex, which made her uncomfortable due to past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel more at ease. So, she set clear boundaries beforehand.\n\nNow, in the situation described, the boyfriend decided to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being gentle and doing things like kissing her body and playing with her hair. The author didn't like these actions and told him to stop, but he kept trying to be affectionate. She then got mad, put on clothes, and left. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the boyfriend respected her boundaries after she had communicated them. If he had previously agreed to her preferences and then changed his approach without her consent, that's a problem. However, the author's reaction is also a factor. She did tell him to stop and left, which is a valid response if her boundaries were violated. But her not responding to his messages might be seen as avoiding communication, which could be a point against her.\n\nBut considering that she had prior communication and the boyfriend didn't adhere to her stated preferences, the fault might lie more with him. The author is within her rights to express her discomfort and leave. The question is whether she's at fault for her reaction. Since she communicated her needs and the boyfriend ignored them, she's not in the wrong for being upset. The answer is B.\n"
