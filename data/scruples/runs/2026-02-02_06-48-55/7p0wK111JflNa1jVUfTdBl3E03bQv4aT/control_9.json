(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: She's 21, he's 26. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of an abusive relationship, and she prefers rough sex to feel like she can let go and have fun. Now, last night, he wanted to do \"normal\" sex, which she interprets as gentle. When she told him she didn't like it, he kept trying cutesy things, and she got mad, left, and hasn't responded. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's think about consent and communication. She had already communicated her preferences. If he didn't follow through after being told she didn't like certain things, maybe he's at fault. But she also reacted by getting mad and leaving. Is her reaction justified? She's dealing with trauma from an abusive relationship, which might affect her needs. But the question is about whether *she* is in the wrong.\n\nShe told him her boundaries. If he respected them, he should have stopped when she said so. However, she got angry and left, and hasn't responded. But from her perspective, he wasn't respecting her boundaries. The problem might be his lack of adherence to her previous communication. Her reaction could be a result of feeling her boundaries were ignored. However, walking out without communication might be seen as abrupt. But given her trauma, maybe her reaction is understandable.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe she should have discussed it further instead of getting mad. But she did tell him she didn't like it, and he kept going. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The key points are about respecting boundaries. If he didn't respect her communicated preferences, he's part of the problem. Her anger might be a reaction to him not listening. So the answer would be B (No) because she's not in the wrong if he wasn't respecting her boundaries. However, her not responding to messages might be a communication issue. But given the context, the main issue is his actions, not hers.\n"
