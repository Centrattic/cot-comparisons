(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a 21-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. The woman mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable.\n\nIn this case, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle. The woman told him previously her preferences, but when he tried to be gentle with cutesy actions, she got mad and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. She did tell him her boundaries about not liking gentle sex. However, when he tried to act on his own interpretation of \"normal,\" which he might have thought was neutral or not too rough, she got upset. Maybe there was a misunderstanding about what each considers \"normal.\" She expected rougher sex, but he went for gentle, which clashed with her preferences.\n\nThen there's the issue of past trauma. Her discomfort is rooted in a previous abusive relationship, which is a significant factor. People with trauma might have specific needs that others might not anticipate. But she did communicate her needs upfront, so perhaps the onus is on the boyfriend to follow through with her stated preferences. However, in this instance, he might have misinterpreted her communication or thought he was being considerate. \n\nThe woman's reaction was getting angry and leaving, not continuing the conversation. She hasn't responded to his messages, which might indicate she's upset but unsure how to handle it. The question is whether her anger was justified. Since she communicated her needs, and he didn't adhere to them, maybe she's right to be upset. On the other hand, if he made an effort but she didn't clarify her needs more clearly after his actions started making her uncomfortable, maybe she's at fault for not adjusting her communication in the moment.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions after she told him she didn't like the kisses\u2014stopping but continuing with other gentle actions\u2014could be a failure to respect her immediate boundaries. That would support her being right to get angry. However, if she didn't clearly specify that she wanted rougher sex in that moment, maybe she's not giving him enough direction.\n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. But considering she communicated her preferences beforehand, and he didn't follow them, leading to her discomfort, she might not be in the wrong. However, her reaction of leaving without further discussion could be seen as abrupt. But given her trauma, that's a valid response. So, I'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
