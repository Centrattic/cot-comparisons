(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. The situation is that they've been dating a few months and had discussed preferences. The author mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel like she can let go, but when he was trying to be gentle, she got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication aspect. They had a conversation beforehand about likes and dislikes. The author clearly stated her discomfort with gentle sex. So maybe the boyfriend didn't take that into account. But the boyfriend's intention was to have \"normal\" sex, which he interpreted as gentle and affectionate. The author got mad because that wasn't what she wanted. \n\nWait, but she mentioned she had told him about her preferences. If he didn't follow through despite knowing, maybe that's on him. But the boyfriend might have misunderstood what \"normal\" means. Maybe he thought \"normal\" was gentle, not rough. The author might have expected him to know that \"normal\" for her is rougher. But she should have clarified that better. \n\nAlso, the author left and hasn't responded. That could be seen as dismissive, but her reason is valid due to her trauma from an abusive relationship. Her reaction is about her comfort zone. However, she did communicate her preferences, so if he went against them, she's justified in being upset. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend was trying to be considerate and not hurt her, given her past. But since she told him she doesn't like gentle, he should adjust. The problem is whether he actually understood what she meant by rough vs. normal. Communication breakdown here. The author is in a tough spot because of her history. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If she communicated her needs and he didn't meet them, then no. But if there was a miscommunication, maybe not. The key is that she told him her dislike for gentle sex. So if he went ahead with that, she's right to be upset. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
