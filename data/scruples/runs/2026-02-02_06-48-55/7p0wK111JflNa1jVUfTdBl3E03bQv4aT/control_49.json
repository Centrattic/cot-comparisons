(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend because he was too gentle during sex. The boyfriend is 26M, and they've been dating for a few months. The key points here are about their communication and the author's past with an abusive relationship.\n\nThe author mentioned they had talked about their likes and dislikes beforehand. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because it makes her uncomfortable, linked to her past abuse. She prefers rough sex, which helps her \"let go and have fun,\" whereas gentle sex makes her anxious. \n\nIn the recent incident, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being gentle with kissing and cutesy actions. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped but kept trying, and she got mad, left, and hasn't replied.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her preferences beforehand. He might not have fully understood or respected her boundaries. When she told him to stop, he kept trying, which could mean he didn't take her feedback seriously. Her reaction of getting angry and leaving might be a valid response to her discomfort. However, not replying might be cutting off communication, which could be another issue. But considering her history, her reaction makes sense. The boyfriend might need to adjust his approach, respecting her stated preferences. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't fully comply, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
