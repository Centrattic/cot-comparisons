(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old female in a relationship with a 26-year-old male. They've been dating for a few months and have regular sex. She mentioned to him before that she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex; it makes her uncomfortable. She has a history of abuse, which might influence her preference for rougher sex. \n\nLast night, when they were about to have sex, he mentioned wanting to have \"normal\" sex. She asked what he meant, and he started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he did, but kept doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's not responding to his messages and is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, communication is key. The author did communicate her preferences beforehand. She mentioned not liking gentle or passionate sex. However, when the situation arose, he tried to engage in gentle behaviors despite her prior communication. That's a problem. If he agreed to her preferences in the past, then changing the approach without considering her feelings could be an issue.\n\nBut she also reacted by getting mad, leaving, and not responding. That could be seen as a valid reaction if he was ignoring her prior boundaries. However, she could have communicated again more clearly instead of just leaving. Her history of abuse is a red flag for potential issues with consent and power dynamics, especially with rough sex. There's a risk that her preference for rough sex could be a way to reclaim control after abuse, but it's important to ensure that both partners are comfortable and that the rough sex is consensual and safe.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions might have been an attempt to be more emotionally connected, which she found uncomfortable. If she had communicated her discomfort again, he should have respected that. But she did tell him to stop initially. The fact that he kept doing cutesy things after she asked him to stop is problematic. That's not respecting her boundaries once she expressed them.\n\nSo, the boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries after she communicated them during the encounter. The author left and didn't respond, which might be a valid response to feeling disrespected. However, not responding could also be seen as cutting off communication without addressing the issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad. Given her history and the fact that he didn't respect her boundaries during the encounter, she might not be in the wrong. But if she had a prior agreement and he changed his approach without discussing it, that's his fault. Her reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a result of his not following her boundaries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't adhere to the agreed-upon terms. Alternatively, if the rough sex has any risks of becoming abusive or non-consensual, that's another layer. But based solely on the scenario provided, the key issue is the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries during the encounter, leading to her frustration and leaving. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
