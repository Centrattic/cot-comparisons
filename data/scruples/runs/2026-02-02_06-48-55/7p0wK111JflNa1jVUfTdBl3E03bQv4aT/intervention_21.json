(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old female who's upset with her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. They had previously discussed their preferences, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past in an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. \n\nIn the situation, the boyfriend tried to be gentle, doing things like kissing her body and playing with her hair. She told him she didn't like it, he stopped, but kept trying to be affectionate. She got mad, put her clothes on, and left. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. She had already told him her preferences, so he might not have fully understood how important it is for her. However, when she told him to stop, he did but kept doing other things. That could be a problem because he might not be respecting her immediate feedback. \n\nOn the other hand, she reacted by leaving and not responding. That might be seen as abrupt. But considering her history of abuse, her triggers are valid. He might need to be more sensitive to her needs. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend didn't take her previous communication seriously and continued with actions she didn't like, then he might be at fault. But if she didn't clearly communicate her discomfort again during the situation, maybe she shares some responsibility. \n\nHowever, given her history, her need for specific types of interactions is understandable. The boyfriend should have respected her boundaries immediately when she told him to stop. Her leaving could be a justified response if he continued to ignore her wishes. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication styles. Maybe she could have discussed her preferences more in the moment rather than reacting with anger. But given her trauma, her reaction might be a result of that, not just overreacting.\n\nSo, considering all factors, she might not be in the wrong. Her boundaries were communicated, and if he didn't respect them after she told him to stop, the blame isn't entirely hers. However, her not responding and leaving could be seen as avoiding conflict. But given the context of her past, it's a complex situation where both might have roles, but perhaps the boyfriend is more in the wrong for not respecting her immediate stop.\n"
