(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old female and her 26-year-old boyfriend who's been dating a few months. They've talked about their preferences, and she mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma. She prefers rougher sex to feel comfortable.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author told her boyfriend her preferences upfront. When he tried to be gentle and affectionate, she got uncomfortable and left. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole for getting mad and not responding to his messages.\n\nFirst, she communicated her needs clearly. That's a good step. The boyfriend, however, didn't stick to her boundaries when she indicated discomfort. Even after she told him to stop, he continued with the cutesy stuff, which led to her leaving. So, he didn't respect her boundaries, which is a red flag.\n\nBut then, her reaction was to put on clothes and leave, and not respond to his messages. While she has the right to set boundaries, avoiding communication entirely might not be the healthiest approach. She could have explained why she was upset instead of ghosting him. However, given her history of abuse, her need for rougher sex and discomfort with gentleness is valid. She's dealing with trauma, which affects her preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend might need to understand that her preferences are due to past experiences, but he also needs to respect them. The fact that he didn't listen when she asked him to stop could be more his fault. The author's immediate reaction might be justified given her trauma. So, she's not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries. However, not responding might not be the best way to handle it long-term. But in the context of the question, the main issue is whether she's in the wrong, considering the scenario. Since he didn't respect her boundaries after she communicated them, she's not the one at fault here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
