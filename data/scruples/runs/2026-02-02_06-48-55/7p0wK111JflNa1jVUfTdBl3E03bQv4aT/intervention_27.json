(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman in a new relationship who's upset because her boyfriend is being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they talked about their preferences beforehand, and she told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. Instead, she prefers rough sex to feel more comfortable. \n\nNow, during their last encounter, the boyfriend tried to be gentle and affectionate, which made her uncomfortable. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The user clearly communicated her boundaries and preferences earlier. That's a good step because it shows she's trying to be open. However, during the actual interaction, when her boyfriend was being gentle, she got upset. But she did tell him to stop, so maybe she followed through on her communication. \n\nBut here's a catch: her previous experience in an abusive relationship might influence her current preferences. However, just because someone had a bad experience doesn't mean their current preferences are right for their new partner. The boyfriend might be respecting her by trying to be gentle, which is a healthy approach. If she's rejecting his efforts, even after he stops, maybe that's a problem.\n\nAlso, communication during the act is important. She told him once, but he kept trying. Maybe she should have been more direct or given specific instructions. On the flip side, if he was trying to adjust and she's still not happy, maybe he needs to listen more. But she left abruptly and hasn't responded, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe main point is whether she's wrong for getting mad. Since she communicated her needs and still felt uncomfortable, her reaction is understandable. However, if she's pushing for rough sex and rejecting emotional connection, that could be an issue. The boyfriend's approach might be healthy, but if she's not happy, there's a problem in communication or mutual adjustment. \n\nBut the key is that she was clear upfront. If he's being gentle despite her saying otherwise, he's at fault. But she also had to tell him again during the act, so maybe she's not in the wrong. Also, her emotional response is valid given her past. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
