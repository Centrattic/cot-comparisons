(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 21-year-old woman who's upset with her 26-year-old boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. She mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand, and she made it clear she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable.\n\nThe situation happened when the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which for him might mean gentle. He tried kissing her body and doing cutesy things like playing with her hair and chaste kisses. She told him to stop, got mad, put on her clothes, and left. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The key points here are communication and mutual consent. She had communicated her preferences, but the boyfriend tried a different approach. Maybe he misunderstood what \"normal\" meant to her. However, when she told him to stop, he continued with the cutesy stuff, which she didn't like. She left, and now he's trying to reach out.\n\nBut wait, she left after telling him to stop, and he kept trying. That might be part of the issue. If she communicated her discomfort but he persisted, that's a problem. However, she also walked out without addressing it fully. Did she give him a chance to adjust or talk it out? Her reaction was to leave and not respond, which could be seen as cutting off communication. \n\nOn the other hand, her past trauma affects her current needs. She might genuinely need rough sex to feel safe. If the boyfriend isn't respecting that, then he's at fault. But since she had already told him her preferences, maybe he should have adjusted. However, if he tried to adjust and she still got upset, there's a communication gap. \n\nThe main issue is whether both parties respected each other's boundaries. She communicated hers, but when he didn't meet them, she reacted negatively. However, leaving and not responding might not be the best approach. Maybe she should have explained more or given him a chance to try again. \n\nAlternatively, if he didn't understand what she meant by \"rough\" and was trying to be gentle because he thought that's what she wanted, then there's a miscommunication. But she had already told him she didn't like gentle. So maybe he should have known better. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she's not wrong for having her preferences, but reacting by leaving and not communicating further might not be the healthiest approach. However, given her past trauma, her reaction is understandable. The boyfriend might also need to work on understanding her needs better. \n\nSo, who's at fault? If the boyfriend didn't heed her boundaries, he's at fault. If she didn't communicate clearly or reacted too harshly, she's at fault. The fact that she had already communicated her preferences suggests the onus is on him to respect them. Her leaving might be a reaction to past trauma, so it's a complex situation. But since he continued after she told him to stop, he's not respecting her boundaries, which is problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for getting mad, but her response could be improved. However, the main fault might be on the boyfriend for not respecting her established boundaries. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that she communicated her needs and he didn't follow them, she's not wrong for being upset. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
