(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman (21F) is in a relationship with a 26M boyfriend. They've been dating a few months and have regular sex. She told him she doesn't like it when it's too gentle or passionate because of past abuse. She prefers rough sex, which helps her let go, and gentle makes her uncomfortable. \n\nLast night, he wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she interprets as being gentle. He started kissing her body, which she didn't like. She told him to stop, he stopped but did other cutesy things like playing with hair and chaste kisses. She got mad, put clothes on, and left. Now she hasn't replied to his messages and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, key points here: She communicated her preferences beforehand. He tried something different, which she didn't like. She expressed her discomfort, he stopped but then kept trying other things. She left angry. \n\nNow, considering consent and communication. She had already told him her boundaries. He tried to engage in something she didn't like after she told him. Even if he thought he was being nice, he wasn't respecting her stated preferences. She then got upset and left. \n\nBut wait, maybe he was trying to be gentle because he thought it was what she wanted? But she told him she doesn't like that. So he should have followed her lead. If he had a different idea, maybe he should have discussed it, not just went ahead. \n\nHer reaction: getting mad and leaving. That's understandable if he violated her boundaries. She might feel disrespected. But not replying to his messages might be cutting off communication. However, she might need time to process. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If he overstepped her boundaries, she's not wrong to be upset. However, maybe her approach could have been better. But given the context of past trauma, her needs are valid. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries after she communicated them. She's acting within her rights to set boundaries and be upset. The AITA here is likely the boyfriend, not the author.\n"
