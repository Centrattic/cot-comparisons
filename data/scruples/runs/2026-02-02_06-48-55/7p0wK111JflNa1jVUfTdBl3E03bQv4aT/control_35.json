(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the 21F) is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author mentioned they had talked about their likes and dislikes before, and she specifically told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex to feel comfortable. \n\nThen, the boyfriend wanted to have \"normal\" sex, which she interpreted as too gentle. When he tried to be affectionate with kisses and playing with her hair, she got uncomfortable and left. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She communicated her preferences upfront, which is good. However, when the boyfriend tried to adjust (maybe interpreting \"normal\" differently), she reacted negatively. But considering her trauma history, her response is a reaction to her discomfort. \n\nBut wait, did she communicate clearly after the initial talk? She told him before, but when he started the gentle stuff, she told him to stop. He tried to stop but kept doing things she didn't like. She then left. \n\nIs there a misunderstanding here? Maybe the boyfriend thought \"normal\" meant something different than what she expected. Or maybe he was trying to be more affectionate after their previous discussions. But she did tell him again during the situation, so he should have respected that. \n\nHer getting mad is a reaction to her trauma and discomfort. She's not wrong for standing up for her boundaries. The boyfriend might need to adjust his approach, but her initial communication is there. However, after she told him to stop and he kept trying, maybe she should have communicated more clearly. But given her history, she's in a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of fault, if she already communicated her needs and he didn't respect them after she told him to stop, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if there was a miscommunication, maybe there's some shared responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Considering her trauma and that she communicated her preferences, I think she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
