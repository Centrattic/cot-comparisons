(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, the author is a 21-year-old woman in a relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few months and have sex regularly. She mentioned she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of past trauma from an abusive relationship. She prefers rough sex for emotional release, whereas gentle sex makes her uncomfortable.\n\nIn the situation, the boyfriend decided to have \"normal\" sex, which led to him being affectionate in ways she didn't like\u2014like kissing her body, playing with her hair, chaste kisses. She told him to stop, got mad, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few factors here. First, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding sexual preferences. The author did communicate her preferences before, so the boyfriend might have misunderstood or not taken it seriously enough. However, in the situation described, she explicitly told him to stop when he was being too gentle, which he continued despite her objections. That could be a problem because respecting a partner's boundaries is essential.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend might have been trying to adjust based on his own interpretation of \"normal\" sex. Maybe he thought \"normal\" meant more gentle, but she had a different understanding. The issue here is that even though she communicated her preferences, maybe there was a breakdown in communication. Did she explain why she prefers rough sex? Did he know about her past trauma? If he's aware and still chose to proceed with gentle methods, that's on him. But if he wasn't clear on her specific needs, perhaps there's room for both sides to communicate better.\n\nAlso, when she got mad and left, that's a reaction. She had a right to be upset if he was ignoring her boundaries. However, walking out without addressing the issue might not be the best approach for resolving conflicts. But in terms of being in the wrong, if he was violating her boundaries, she's justified in her anger.\n\nThe key points are: prior communication about preferences, the boyfriend's actions after she told him to stop, and the context of past trauma. If he continued despite her clear communication, he's at fault. If she didn't clearly convey her needs again in that specific instance, maybe there's some responsibility on her. However, she had previously stated her preferences, so the onus is on him to respect them. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because she's asserting her boundaries. But if the boyfriend was trying to adjust in a good-faith effort and misunderstood, then maybe the situation is more nuanced. Still, she did tell him to stop, so he should have heeded that. So the answer would likely be B (No), she's not in the wrong because she's upholding her boundaries, and he should have respected them after she communicated her discomfort.\n"
