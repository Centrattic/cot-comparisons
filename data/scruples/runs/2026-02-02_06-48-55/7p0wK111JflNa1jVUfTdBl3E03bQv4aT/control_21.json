(nsfw)\nI (21F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been dating for a few months and have been having sex regularly. We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don\u2019t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it\u2019s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I\u2019ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it\u2019s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have \u201cnormal\u201d sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn\u2019t really like.  I told him I didn\u2019t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn\u2019t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven\u2019t answered his messages today. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 21F) is at fault for getting angry at her boyfriend for being too gentle during sex. \n\nFirst, the author mentioned they had discussed their preferences beforehand. She told him she doesn't like gentle or passionate sex because of her past abusive relationship. She finds rough sex more comfortable. The boyfriend, however, tried to be gentle and affectionate, which upset her. She told him to stop, got angry, and left. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. They had a prior conversation about her preferences. If he knew she didn't like gentle and passionate stuff, why did he go ahead with that? Maybe he misunderstood or thought he could handle it differently. But she clearly communicated her boundaries again during the interaction. When she asked him to stop, he should have respected that. \n\nHer reaction of getting angry and leaving could be seen as a valid response to discomfort, especially given her trauma from the abusive relationship. It's important that partners respect each other's boundaries. However, her abrupt exit and not responding might be seen as not giving him a chance to adjust or talk it out. \n\nBut considering the context of her past abuse and the prior communication, her discomfort is valid. The boyfriend should have adjusted his behavior to meet her needs. The author isn't wrong for standing up for her boundaries. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her preferences after they were discussed. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has a legitimate reason based on her past and communicated her needs. The boyfriend should have listened and adjusted, but she's not wrong for being upset when those boundaries were crossed.\n"
