I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether sharing her lack of orgasms with her husband was a bad move. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to bring it up during a conversation. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he interpreted as a loaded or attacking question. He got defensive, angry, and started shouting. She apologized, but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife is expressing a legitimate concern about her sexual satisfaction in the marriage. It's a sensitive topic, and communication about intimacy can be tricky. She might have approached it in a direct way that he found confrontational. But the husband's reaction seems extreme. Getting angry, shouting, and then not genuinely apologizing suggests he's not handling the discussion well. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, bringing up a problem is not inherently wrong. The issue might be how the question was phrased. Asking \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" could come off as accusatory if not framed with care. However, the husband's response\u2014immediately getting defensive and angry\u2014might indicate his own issues with communication or insecurity. \n\nThe wife's intention was to share her frustration and address a problem in the relationship. That's a valid reason to talk about it. The husband's reaction seems to shut down the conversation rather than engage constructively. So, while the wife could have approached the conversation differently, the husband's response is problematic. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. I think in this context, the husband's behavior is more blameworthy. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is important for a healthy relationship. The husband's anger and defensiveness are the real issues here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for bringing up the issue, even if the method could have been smoother.\n"
