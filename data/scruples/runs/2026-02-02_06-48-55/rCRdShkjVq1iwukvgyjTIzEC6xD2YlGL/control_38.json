I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to tell her husband. She asked him when the last time he had one was, and he reacted negatively. He got angry, said she was attacking him, and started slamming doors. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is in a marriage where she's not getting physical satisfaction. Communication is key in relationships, and she tried to express her feelings. But the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a question that could be seen as accusatory or loaded, especially in the middle of driving. That could have been stressful for him. His reaction seems defensive and maybe he felt attacked, which led to his anger.\n\nBut the core issue is the lack of mutual satisfaction in their sexual relationship. She's honest about her frustration, which is valid. However, the method of communication matters. If she approached him calmly and expressed her needs without making him feel defensive, maybe the conversation would have gone better. She did apologize, but his response was still harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, her husband's reaction is problematic. Getting angry and slamming doors isn't healthy conflict resolution. He should be open to discussing issues in the relationship. But the question is if she's in the wrong. She was trying to communicate an important issue, even if the delivery wasn't perfect. So maybe she's not the asshole because she's addressing a real problem, even if the approach could be improved. But some might argue that she should have handled it differently to avoid making him feel attacked.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, the answer often leans towards the person communicating their needs, even if the method isn't perfect. So probably the answer is B (No), she's not the asshole. The husband's reaction is more concerning because he's not handling the feedback constructively. The woman's intention was to address a valid issue, even if the timing or phrasing could be better.\n"
