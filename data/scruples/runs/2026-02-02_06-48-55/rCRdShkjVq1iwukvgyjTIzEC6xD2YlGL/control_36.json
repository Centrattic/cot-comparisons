I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple having issues with intimacy. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. His reaction is defensive and angry.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The woman brought up a sensitive topic. She asked when he last had an orgasm, which could be a loaded question. But then she told him she hasn't had one since October. His response was emotional, making her question if she was wrong to bring it up.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. He got angry, blamed her for attacking him, and didn't engage constructively. The woman apologized for her approach, but his response was still negative. The problem here might be how she approached it, but the husband's defensive behavior is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should communicate openly, but the way each handles the conversation matters. The woman might have been direct, but the husband's reaction was unhelpful and hostile. So, while the approach could be improved, the main issue is the husband's defensiveness. Therefore, the woman isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
