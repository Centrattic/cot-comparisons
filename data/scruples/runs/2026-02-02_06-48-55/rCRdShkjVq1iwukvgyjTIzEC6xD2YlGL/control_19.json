I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is 24, her husband 25. They've been married, and she hasn't had an orgasm since October. She approaches him with a question about his last orgasm, which he perceives as a loaded question. She then tells him she hasn't had one since October. He responds with a groan and accuses himself of being awful, then gets angry and attacks her for being critical. He's upset with her approach, and she apologizes, but he continues to be angry, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the author (the wife) is the asshole. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nI need to consider communication in relationships. Open communication is important, especially regarding intimacy. However, the way she approached the topic might have been abrupt or could have been better framed. But the husband's reaction seems extreme. His response of being defensive, angry, and then not truly apologizing might indicate issues on his part. The wife is trying to address a problem that affects their relationship. Not having orgasms could indicate a problem that needs addressing for both partners. The husband's reaction of anger and deflection might suggest he's not handling the issue well. However, the wife could have approached it differently, perhaps with more empathy or in a non-confrontational setting. But since the husband is reacting so negatively, the wife's intent was to communicate a problem, which is valid. The husband's response is problematic. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the wife isn't necessarily at fault. She's trying to address an issue that's important for their relationship. The husband's defensiveness and anger are more concerning. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
