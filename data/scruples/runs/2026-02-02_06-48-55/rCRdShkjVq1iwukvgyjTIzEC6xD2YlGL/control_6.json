I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The woman hasn't had an orgasm since October and is feeling frustrated. She asks her husband when he last had an orgasm. His reaction is defensive and angry, with him feeling attacked. The wife apologizes, but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending insincere apologies.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, communication is crucial. Bringing up a sensitive topic like sexual satisfaction is important for both partners. However, how it's approached matters. She used a loaded question by asking him about his last orgasm first. That could make him feel defensive or accused. Instead of directly stating her own frustration, she might have framed it as a request to talk about their intimacy rather than a confrontational question. \n\nHer husband's reaction is problematic too\u2014getting angry, shouting, and being dismissive. That's not a healthy way to handle such a conversation. But the question is about the wife's actions. Did she overstep? Maybe. The way she phrased the question might have been triggering. A better approach could have been starting with her own feelings, like \"I haven't been able to reach orgasm lately, and I'm feeling frustrated. Can we talk about how we can address this?\" Instead, she starts by asking him a question that could be seen as accusatory, which might explain his defensive reaction.\n\nHowever, the core issue is her lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a valid concern. She's not wrong for wanting to address it, but the method could be better. The husband's response is definitely not okay, but that doesn't necessarily make her the asshole. In AITA scenarios, often both parties have some responsibility, but the question is about whether the asker is the asshole. Since she's trying to communicate a problem, even if the approach was flawed, she's not entirely in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more egregious, but her method could use improvement. However, in the context of AITA, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the husband's behavior is more clearly problematic. But I'm a bit torn because communication style matters. Ultimately, she's not the asshole here.\n"
