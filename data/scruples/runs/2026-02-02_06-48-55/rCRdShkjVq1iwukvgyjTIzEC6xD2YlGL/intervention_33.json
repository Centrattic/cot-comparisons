I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves a marital issue where communication is key.\n\nFirst, the author is frustrated and decides to be honest about her lack of orgasms. She asks her husband when he last had one, which might have been a confrontational way to approach the issue. Her husband reacts negatively, getting angry and defensive. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication style and the intent behind the question. The author's intent was to express her frustration and perhaps initiate a conversation about their sexual relationship. However, the way she phrased the question could have been perceived as accusatory, especially since she admits it was a loaded question. \n\nThe husband's reaction is important too. He feels attacked and responds with anger, which might indicate that he's not handling the conversation well. But does that mean the author is in the wrong? Maybe she could have approached the topic more delicately. On the other hand, withholding such important information for six months might not be healthy either. \n\nThe husband slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies shows poor communication from his side as well. However, the question is about the author's actions. Was she wrong to bring up the issue directly? Or is it understandable given the long period without satisfaction?\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial, but the method of communication matters. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to address the problem, but perhaps the way she did it could be improved. However, since the main issue is about whether she's the asshole (AITA), the focus is on her actions. \n\nConsidering that the husband didn't take it well, but the author had a valid reason to express her feelings, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. However, the way she approached it could have been better. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the focus is on the approach being confrontational, maybe A (Yes). \n\nBut given that the husband's reaction was extreme and he's not taking responsibility, the author's intent was valid. Therefore, the answer is likely B.\n"
