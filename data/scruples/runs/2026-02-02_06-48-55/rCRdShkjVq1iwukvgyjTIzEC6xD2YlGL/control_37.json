I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the 24-year-old wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is frustrated because she hasn't been able to reach orgasm, which is a valid concern in a relationship. Communication about sexual satisfaction is important, so bringing it up isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she approached it might be a factor.\n\nShe asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he took as a loaded question. Then she admitted her own lack of orgasms. His reaction was defensive and angry, which is a problem. But the question is whether she was wrong. \n\nThe user is asking if she's the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the key points here are about communication styles and mutual responsibility. The wife has a right to express her dissatisfaction, but the way she framed the question might have been confrontational. However, the husband's reaction\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors\u2014is also problematic. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to approach sensitive topics with care. The wife's intent was to address a real issue, but maybe she could have approached it more gently. However, she's not in the wrong just because her husband reacted badly. His response is his responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). She's communicating a legitimate concern, even if the method could be improved. The husband's behavior is more concerning, but that doesn't mean the wife is the one at fault here.\n"
