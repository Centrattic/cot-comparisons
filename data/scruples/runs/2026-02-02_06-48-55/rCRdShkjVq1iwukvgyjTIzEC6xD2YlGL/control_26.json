I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing their sexual satisfaction. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to bring it up, which led to a conflict. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman is expressing a serious issue in their relationship\u2014lack of sexual satisfaction. That's a valid concern because intimacy is important in a marriage. She might have felt frustrated and decided to communicate her feelings, which is generally a healthy step in relationships.\n\nNow, her husband's reaction seems negative. He got defensive, angry, and accused her of attacking him. He also didn't handle the situation well by slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. His reaction could indicate that he felt criticized or attacked, but his response was inappropriate and hurtful. \n\nThe key here is how the communication was handled. The woman asked a question that was meant to open a dialogue about their intimacy. While the question might have been loaded, it's a sensitive topic, and approaching it with a non-accusatory tone is important. However, she did apologize after realizing her approach might have been harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's immediate defensiveness and anger suggest he didn't take responsibility or engage constructively. His behavior escalated the situation, which is unhelpful. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel safe to discuss such issues without fear of backlash. \n\nThe woman's main wrongdoing might be the way she phrased the question, but given the context of her frustration, it's understandable. The husband's response was more harmful because it shut down communication and led to emotional harm. \n\nConsidering all this, the woman's intent was to address a problem, and while her approach could be improved, the husband's reaction was more at fault. Therefore, the answer is likely B\u2014she's not the asshole.\n"
