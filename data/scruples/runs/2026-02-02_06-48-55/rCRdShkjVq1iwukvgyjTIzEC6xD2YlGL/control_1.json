I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked him when he last had one, and he reacted angrily, getting upset and slamming doors.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author brought up a sensitive topic, which is important for their intimacy. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a loaded question while he was driving, which could be stressful. His reaction suggests he felt attacked, which might indicate he's not comfortable discussing this topic. \n\nBut the core issue is about the lack of orgasms. The author is expressing her frustration, which is valid. Not having orgasms can lead to dissatisfaction in a relationship. The husband's response was defensive and angry, which isn't helpful. However, the author's method of bringing it up might have been confrontational. Maybe she should have approached it in a more constructive way, focusing on solutions rather than making him feel blamed.\n\nOn the other hand, expecting a partner to have regular orgasms is reasonable. The husband's defensiveness and not taking responsibility could be part of the problem. The author is seeking validation here, which is a common aspect in such situations. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because she's addressing a legitimate concern. However, the way she communicated it could be improved. The husband's reaction is also problematic. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
