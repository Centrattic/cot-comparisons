I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband by asking when he last had one. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and upset, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The key points are: the wife is experiencing a lack of sexual satisfaction, she's been frustrated, and she decides to ask her husband about his last orgasm. The husband's reaction is defensive and angry, which leads to conflict. She's seeking validation.\n\nIn relationships, communication about sexual needs is important. It's a sensitive topic, and how it's approached can affect the other person's reaction. The wife's question might come across as a criticism or a comparison, especially if it's delivered in a confrontational way. However, the husband's response is also problematic. His immediate defensiveness and anger suggest he may not be open to discussing the issue constructively. \n\nThe user is asking if the wife is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider if the wife's approach was inappropriate. While bringing up the issue is valid, the way she did it might have been a loaded question, which she acknowledges. However, the husband's overreaction is not justified. The wife is expressing a real issue, which is the lack of physical intimacy, and it's reasonable for her to want to address it. The husband's response of anger and not engaging constructively is a red flag for communication issues in the relationship. \n\nBut maybe the wife could have framed the conversation differently. Instead of asking about his last orgasm, which might imply a comparison, she could have discussed her own needs and feelings. However, the husband's reaction is extreme, and the wife apologizing doesn't seem to resolve the issue because the husband isn't addressing the underlying problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably. The wife is voicing her needs, even if the method was a bit blunt. The husband's reaction is more about defensiveness than addressing the issue. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to address a problem, and while the approach might be improved, the husband's response is the bigger issue.\n"
