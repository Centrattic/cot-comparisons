I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman married to her husband. They haven't had sex with orgasms in six months. She's frustrated and asks him when the last time he had an orgasm was. She then tells him she hasn't had one since October. He reacts angrily, getting upset and slamming doors, etc. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication in a relationship. The wife is trying to express her frustration about their sex life. She's being honest about her lack of orgasm, which can be a sensitive topic. But how she approached it might have been a problem. She asked him a loaded question first, which he pointed out. Then she told him her situation. \n\nHe reacted with anger, which could stem from feeling criticized or attacked. He might feel that she's blaming him for her lack of orgasm. The husband's reaction seems harsh, but maybe he's defensive. The wife apologized but he's still upset. \n\nIs the wife in the wrong? Well, bringing up a sensitive topic like this can be difficult. She might have approached it in a way that made him feel defensive. Maybe she could have been more empathetic or used \"I\" statements instead of starting with a loaded question. However, she's also trying to communicate a problem in their relationship. Not addressing it could lead to more issues. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, starting with a loaded question (\"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\") might have been the wrong approach. It could have made him feel like she's accusing him. Then she followed up by stating her own experience, which he took as criticism. \n\nOn the other hand, she's being honest about her needs, which is important in a relationship. If she's not communicating her issues, that could also be a problem. The husband's reaction seems extreme, but his response might indicate deeper issues in their communication. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for trying to communicate the problem. However, her approach might have been flawed. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the husband overreacted with anger and slamming doors, etc., the fault isn't entirely hers. She's trying to address an issue, which is a valid step. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
