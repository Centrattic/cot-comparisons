I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is that the author brought up the issue directly, which made her husband defensive and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. It's important to talk about needs and feelings, especially in a marriage. The author was honest about her lack of orgasms, which is a legitimate concern. But the way she approached it might have triggered her husband. He felt attacked, so maybe she could have discussed it differently, like using \"I\" statements instead of asking when the last time he had one, which he found loaded.\n\nHowever, the husband's reaction seems extreme. He got angry, shouted, and slammed doors. His response of \"everything I do is wrong\" suggests he took it as a personal failure rather than a mutual issue to address. In healthy communication, both partners should be open to discussing problems without defensiveness. The author's frustration is valid, and it's reasonable to seek intimacy and satisfaction in a relationship.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author had a right to express her dissatisfaction and if her method was appropriate. While the approach could be improved, the core issue is the lack of physical satisfaction, which is a valid reason to communicate. The husband's reaction seems more about defensiveness than addressing the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong for bringing up a concern even if the conversation didn't go well. The problem might be more on the husband's response than the author's initial statement.\n"
