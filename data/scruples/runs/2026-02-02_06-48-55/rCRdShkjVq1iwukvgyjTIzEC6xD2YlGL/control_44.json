I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is 24 and her husband is 25. They're married, so communication in a long-term relationship is important. The wife is frustrated and brings up the issue, which is a valid concern for many couples. She's not just being petty; she's addressing a real problem in their sex life.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems immediate and defensive. He labels her question as \"loaded,\" which is a sign of defensiveness rather than openness. His response with a loud groan and self-deprecating comments suggests he might feel criticized. However, his anger and shouting indicate he took the question the wrong way. The wife apologized for her approach, but the husband continued with slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. That behavior is problematic.\n\nThe key here is whether the wife's action of being honest about her lack of orgasms was inappropriate. In a healthy relationship, discussing sexual satisfaction is normal. The issue here might lie in how she approached it, but the husband's reaction was overly harsh. The wife's intention was to communicate a problem, which is not inconsiderate. The husband's response, including yelling and slamming doors, shows poor communication skills and emotional control. \n\nThe wife's question was a direct way to address the issue. While the method might not have been perfect, the topic itself is a legitimate concern. The husband's defensiveness and anger suggest he didn't handle the conversation well. The wife isn't the asshole for bringing up a valid issue that affects both of them. The husband's reaction is more indicative of the problem here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The wife's action was about addressing a real problem in the relationship, and the husband's response was the issue. The user is not the one in the wrong.\n"
