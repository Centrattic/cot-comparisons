I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The husband reacted with anger, got defensive, and started shouting. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The wife is sharing a personal issue about not achieving orgasm, which can be a sensitive topic. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he called a loaded question. She then told him her own situation. His reaction was anger and defensiveness, which might indicate he felt attacked or blamed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication in relationships can be tricky. The wife's approach might have been confrontational, especially while driving, which could have added stress. However, expressing a need for physical intimacy is a valid concern. The husband's reaction seems overly defensive; instead of addressing her feelings, he becomes angry and blames her for attacking him. \n\nBut the key is whether she's at fault. The user's reasoning is that she might have approached it poorly, maybe without considering the timing or his feelings. However, bringing up a lack of sexual satisfaction is a legitimate issue. It's possible she could have framed it differently, like expressing her feelings rather than directly stating the problem. But is that her fault? She's seeking validation, so she might not be in the wrong for expressing her needs, even if the method could be improved. \n\nThe husband's response is problematic. He deflects and gets angry instead of engaging constructively. That suggests he's not handling the situation well. However, the initial question might have been a trigger for him. If the wife approached it in a way that he perceived as criticism, that's a communication issue on both sides. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at both parties' actions. The wife is voicing a genuine concern, which isn't inherently wrong. The husband's defensive reaction is his own issue. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's expressing her needs, and while the timing or phrasing could be improved, the core issue is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any wrongdoing on her part. Maybe she should have approached it more gently, but the question is whether she's the asshole. In AITA, being an asshole usually involves intentional harm or manipulation. She's not doing that here. So I think the answer is B.\n"
