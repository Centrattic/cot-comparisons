I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and brings it up to her husband. He reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. The author apologizes but the husband continues being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is expressing her frustration about not experiencing sexual satisfaction, which is a legitimate concern. It's important in a relationship to communicate such issues. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a loaded question about when he last had an orgasm, which could come off as accusatory or comparing their experiences. The husband's reaction is also concerning\u2014getting angry, shouting, and slamming doors. His response seems defensive and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nBut the core issue is the lack of communication and understanding between them. The wife has a valid reason to express her dissatisfaction, but the method could have been more constructive. The husband's reaction is not healthy, but the question is about the wife's actions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both could be at fault for not handling the conversation better. However, since the husband's response was disproportionate and aggressive, it might place more responsibility on him. The wife is trying to address an issue that affects her well-being, which is not the problem. The way she asked the question might have been poorly chosen, but her intent was to communicate a serious issue. \n\nI think the key here is whether bringing up the lack of orgasms is inherently wrong. In a healthy relationship, discussing sexual satisfaction is important. The problem lies in the husband's reaction, but the wife isn't in the wrong for initiating the conversation, even if her approach was flawed. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that she could have approached it differently. But given the context, her intent is valid, and the husband's reaction is the bigger issue. So B makes sense.\n"
