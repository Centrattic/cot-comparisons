I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and brought it up to her husband. The husband reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. The question is whether the wife is in the wrong for bringing this up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife hasn't been having orgasms, which is a legitimate concern in a marriage. Communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. She approached the topic by asking her husband when he last had an orgasm, which she admits was a loaded question. He responded defensively, and the conversation escalated.\n\nBut is she in the wrong for bringing it up? Well, wanting to have a fulfilling sex life is normal, and addressing the issue isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. Starting with a loaded question could have been confrontational. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, like expressing her feelings without making it a comparison. However, the husband's reaction was also extreme\u2014he got angry, shouted, and was dismissive. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue that the husband's reaction was the issue. The question is whether the act of bringing up the issue itself is wrong. Since the wife is being honest and trying to address a problem, even if the method was a bit confrontational, it's not necessarily her fault. The husband's defensiveness and anger might be his own issues. \n\nSo, considering that the wife is seeking to improve their relationship and has a valid concern, even if the approach wasn't perfect, the wrong might lie more with the husband's response. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
