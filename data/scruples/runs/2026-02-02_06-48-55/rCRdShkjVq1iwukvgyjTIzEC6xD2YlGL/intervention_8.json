I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is about communication issues in a marriage regarding sexual satisfaction. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband by asking when he last had one. He reacts negatively, gets angry, and the situation escalates.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is. I need to consider both sides. \n\nThe woman's intention seems to be to address a problem in their marriage. Not having orgasms for that long could indicate a lack of satisfaction, so bringing it up is a valid concern. However, the way she approached it was by asking a loaded question about his last orgasm, which he found confrontational. That might have been an aggressive way to start the conversation. Maybe she could have approached it more gently, focusing on her own feelings rather than making it about him. For example, instead of asking when he last had an orgasm, she might have said, \"I haven't been able to have an orgasm in a while, and I feel frustrated. Can we talk about how to improve our intimacy?\" \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was also problematic. He got defensive, angry, and started blaming her for attacking him. His response of slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies is definitely not healthy. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, initiating a conversation about intimacy is important, but the method matters. If the question was phrased in a way that made him feel defensive, that's a valid point. However, if he's already upset and responding with anger, the responsibility isn't entirely on her for the way she asked the question. Both partners have roles in how they communicate. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is that she's not entirely in the wrong. She brought up a legitimate issue, but the approach could have been better. However, the husband's reaction is also a major red flag. The key is whether her question was the primary cause of the conflict. Since he immediately called it a loaded question, it's possible she approached it in a way that triggered defensiveness. So, perhaps she did have some part in the way the conversation started, but the husband's response is still inappropriate. \n\nThe dilemma here is whether the initial question was the wrong approach. If the question was meant to open a dialogue but was phrased confrontationally, maybe she's partially at fault. However, the husband's reaction is what escalated things. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn these \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person's actions were reasonable. If she had a valid reason to bring up her lack of orgasms, that's reasonable. The way she phrased the question might have been a mistake, but the core issue is the lack of satisfaction. The husband's reaction is more of the problem. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of answer, the options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no). Considering that both sides have faults but the core issue is about communication, the author's question might not be the main issue. However, if the question was confrontational, maybe she's partially at fault. But since the husband's reaction is so extreme, maybe the blame isn't on her. \n\nI think the answer is B (no, she's not in the wrong) because she's addressing a legitimate concern, even if the approach could have been better. The husband's overreaction is the bigger problem here.\n"
