I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't been having orgasms. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe woman, 24, married to a 25-year-old man, hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She brings it up by asking him when he last had one, which he finds loaded. She then tells him her situation, and he reacts angrily, getting upset and slamming doors. She's seeking validation here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her approach was appropriate. She was honest about her feelings, which is important in a relationship. Communication is key, but the way she brought it up might have been a trigger for him. He responded negatively, but that's more about his reaction than her right to express her feelings. \n\nHe called her approach \"loaded,\" so maybe he felt attacked. However, not being able to achieve an orgasm is a significant issue in a marriage, and she's seeking a solution. Her question was direct, but it's a valid concern. The husband's reaction is more about his defensiveness rather than her being wrong. \n\nThe key points here are her honesty and his reaction. She's not the one at fault for bringing up a legitimate issue. He should handle the conversation better, but that doesn't make her wrong for initiating it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
