I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 24-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The husband's reaction seems pretty negative\u2014he got angry, shouted, slammed doors, and sent half-hearted apologies. \n\nFirst, the act of communicating about sexual dissatisfaction is generally not wrong. Open communication in a relationship is usually encouraged. The problem might be how she approached it. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. But she then told him the truth about not having an orgasm in months. His reaction was defensive and angry, which could indicate a deeper issue in their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and mutual respect. If she approached it in a confrontational way, maybe she could have worded it differently. But even so, expressing genuine feelings about a long-standing issue isn't inherently wrong. The husband's response\u2014getting angry, shouting, and being defensive\u2014suggests he might be handling the situation poorly, perhaps feeling criticized or attacked. However, the author's intention was to share her experience, which is valid. \n\nBut the question is whether she's the asshole. The husband's reaction is clearly problematic, but the initial act of bringing up a sensitive topic isn't necessarily wrong. It's possible that both could have handled it better. However, since the user is asking if she's in the wrong specifically, and she's the one who brought up the issue, maybe there's a nuance here. If she used a confrontational tone or didn't consider his feelings, that could be a factor. But given that she apologized after realizing he felt attacked, and the husband's reaction was extreme, it might balance out. \n\nIn relationships, bringing up personal issues is important for intimacy. The husband's defensiveness is a red flag. The author isn't wrong for expressing her lack of satisfaction; however, the way she approached it might have been a factor. But since the husband's response was so negative and dismissive, it's more about his handling of the situation. The core issue is the lack of orgasms, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because expressing a sexual concern is reasonable, and the husband's reaction is the more concerning part. The author isn't the asshole here for initiating the conversation, even if the method could be improved. The main issue is the husband's inability to handle the feedback constructively.\n"
