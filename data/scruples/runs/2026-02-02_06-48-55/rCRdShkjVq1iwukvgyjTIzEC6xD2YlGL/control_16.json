I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and finally tells her husband. She's seeking validation on whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife is honest about her experience, which is a big step. She's communicated her frustration, which is important in any relationship. The husband's reaction seems to be defensive and angry, which is problematic. He's taking her honesty as an attack, which might indicate that he's not handling the situation well or there's underlying issues in their communication. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles. The wife asked a direct question about their sexual satisfaction, which is valid. The husband's response was to become defensive and angry, which isn't a healthy reaction. Even though the way she approached the question might have been a bit loaded, his reaction of groaning, shouting, and slamming the door suggests he's not dealing with the issue constructively. \n\nBut wait, maybe she could have approached it in a more collaborative way. Instead of asking \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which might sound accusatory, maybe a more open discussion about their sexual relationship would be better. However, the husband's response is the main issue here. His defensiveness and anger are signs of poor communication and possible insecurity or lack of willingness to address the problem. \n\nAlso, considering that the wife is the one bringing up a concern about their intimacy, it's a valid point. She's trying to address a problem that affects both of them. The husband's reaction of making it personal and attacking her communication style instead of addressing the issue itself is where the real issue lies. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the wife is trying to communicate a problem that affects their relationship. The husband's defensive and angry reaction is the problem here. The wife is not in the wrong for expressing her feelings and seeking to address the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B, she is not in the wrong.\n"
