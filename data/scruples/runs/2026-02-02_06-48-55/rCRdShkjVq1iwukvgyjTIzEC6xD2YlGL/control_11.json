I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had orgasms. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and recently brought it up by asking her husband when he last had one. He reacted negatively, feeling attacked and defensive. She apologized but he continued to be angry and passive-aggressive. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, open communication in a relationship is usually considered important, especially regarding sexual satisfaction. Bringing up a concern that affects intimacy seems valid. However, the way the question was phrased might have been confrontational. She asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which could come off as accusatory, especially if there's existing tension. \n\nHer husband's reaction was defensive, which might indicate past issues or communication problems. He felt attacked and responded with anger, which isn't helpful. But does that mean she was wrong to bring it up? Maybe not the content of the question, but the method. She could have approached it more collaboratively, like expressing her feelings and inviting a discussion rather than implying blame.\n\nHowever, the husband's overreaction and not addressing the actual issue might be his fault. The author's concern is legitimate, and she had a right to express it. The key here is whether her approach was justified. While it's possible she could have phrased it better, the husband's response was disproportionate. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. The husband's defensiveness and lack of willingness to address the issue are problematic. But the way she brought it up could have been improved. However, in terms of right and wrong, if she's expressing a genuine concern, even if the delivery was harsh, it's not entirely her fault. The husband's reaction is more of an issue. \n\nBut the question is whether she's the asshole. In AITA situations, the judgment is often about intentions and actions. Her intention was to address a problem, which is reasonable. The husband's defensiveness and not addressing the root cause of the problem might be his fault. So, the answer is probably B (No), she's not in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more to blame.\n"
