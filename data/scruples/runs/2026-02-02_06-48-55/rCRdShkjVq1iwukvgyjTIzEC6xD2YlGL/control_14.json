I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a woman telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asks him when he last had one, and he reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. The question is whether she's the asshole (AITA) for bringing up the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is married, and the woman hasn't had an orgasm in months. That seems like a significant issue, especially in a marriage where mutual satisfaction is important. She was feeling frustrated, so she asked her husband about when he last had one. That might have been a way to start a conversation about their sexual relationship. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She acknowledges the question was loaded, which suggests she was aware it might be confrontational. \n\nHer husband's reaction is strong\u2014he got defensive, angry, and blamed her for attacking him. He's slamming doors, yelling, and sending half-hearted apologies. That's not healthy communication. But does that mean she was wrong to bring it up? Or is it about how she brought it up?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If there's a problem, it's important to discuss it. However, the approach matters. If she came in with an accusatory tone or made him feel attacked, that could have triggered his defensive reaction. The fact that he felt she's always attacking him might indicate a pattern of communication issues. \n\nBut the core issue here is the lack of mutual satisfaction. The woman is clearly distressed because she's not getting any pleasure from sex, which is a legitimate concern. She's trying to address it, which is a responsible move. However, the way she framed the question might have been the problem. Instead of leading with her own frustration, maybe she could have approached it more collaboratively. \n\nIt's possible that the husband's reaction is an overreaction, which could suggest he's in denial or unwilling to address the issue. But does that make the author in the wrong for trying to talk about it? Or is the husband's reaction the bigger problem here?\n\nThe author apologized for her approach, which shows she's trying to de-escalate the situation. However, her husband is still being aggressive. The question is whether bringing up the issue was the wrong move. \n\nIn many cases, not addressing such issues can lead to resentment. So, the author is trying to communicate, which is necessary. However, the loaded question might have been a poor approach. But even then, the husband's response is excessive and unhealthy. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the act of bringing up the issue is inherently wrong. Since the problem is real and needs addressing, the author isn't wrong for initiating the conversation. However, the method could be improved. But the main issue here is the husband's reaction. The question is whether she's the asshole, which implies if she's the one in the wrong. \n\nGiven that she's trying to address a legitimate concern, even if the approach was loaded, she's not the one in the wrong. The husband's response is more problematic. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
