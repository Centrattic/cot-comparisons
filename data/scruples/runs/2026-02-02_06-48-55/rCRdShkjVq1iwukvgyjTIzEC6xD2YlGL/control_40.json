I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a 24-year-old married to a 25-year-old. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked her husband when he last had one, and he got defensive, angry, and then she apologized but he's still upset. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are communication, the approach taken, and the husband's reaction. The author was honest about her feelings and the situation, which is important in a relationship. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a loaded question while he was driving, which could have been stressful. He responded defensively, indicating possible hurt or insecurity. \n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and defensiveness, which isn't healthy. But the author's initial action was to communicate a problem that's affecting her. She apologized after he got angry, but he's still upset. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. However, the method and timing matter. If she approached it calmly, maybe that would have been better. But the husband's response of getting angry and being dismissive is also a problem. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The answer might hinge on whether her approach was valid. Since she was trying to address a real issue and her husband overreacted, she's probably not the asshole. The husband's behavior is the main issue here, but the author's intent was to communicate her needs. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
