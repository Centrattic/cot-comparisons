I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She brought it up after being frustrated, and he reacted angrily, saying she always attacks him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Communication is key in relationships. The author is expressing a problem she's been having, which is a valid concern. However, the way she approached it might have been a factor. She asked him a loaded question about his last orgasm, which he found confrontational. His reaction was anger and defensiveness, which isn't ideal either.\n\nThe author's intention was to express her frustration and perhaps find a solution. But bringing it up in the middle of driving might not have been the best time. Also, starting with a loaded question could make him feel attacked, even if her intention was different. However, the core issue is about mutual satisfaction in the marriage. She's not wrong to want to address this, but the approach might have been flawed. Her husband's response was also problematic, but the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's trying to communicate a serious issue, even if the method could be improved, I think she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
