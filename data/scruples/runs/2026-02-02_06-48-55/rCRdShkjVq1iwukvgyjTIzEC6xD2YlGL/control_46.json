I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to confront her husband about it. She asked when he last had one, which led to his defensive reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the wife's approach was appropriate. She expressed her frustration and brought up a personal issue. It's important to consider communication styles here. The husband reacted with anger and defensiveness, which isn't ideal. He didn't seem to validate her feelings or engage constructively.\n\nThe wife's intention was to share her own experience and maybe seek solutions. But the way she asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" could come across as accusatory. Using \"I\" statements might have been better, like expressing her own feelings without making it about him. However, the husband's response was clearly problematic. He dismissed her, became angry, and didn't take responsibility. His behavior is more concerning.\n\nIn relationships, when one partner brings up an issue, the other's reaction is crucial. If the husband is defensive and attacks instead of listening, that's a red flag. The wife is trying to communicate her needs, which is a healthy approach. The problem lies in his reaction, not necessarily her initiating the conversation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the wife isn't in the wrong for wanting to address her lack of orgasms. It's a valid concern and important for their relationship. The husband's response is inappropriate and unhelpful. Therefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
