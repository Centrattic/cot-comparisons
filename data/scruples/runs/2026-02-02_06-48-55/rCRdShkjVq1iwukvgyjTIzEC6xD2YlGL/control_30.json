I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked him when he last had one, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, communication issues in relationships are common. The author brought up a sensitive topic, which is her lack of orgasms. That's a valid concern for her, as sexual satisfaction is important in a marriage. But the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. His reaction was defensive and angry, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe key points here: The author had a legitimate reason to express her frustration. However, the manner in which she asked could have been more constructive. Maybe starting a conversation about their sex life without confrontation. But since she did ask directly, and he responded with anger, it's hard to say she's entirely at fault. \n\nHusbands should be open to discussing their partner's needs. His reaction of shouting and slamming doors is definitely not okay. The author apologized, which shows she tried to de-escalate, but his response was extreme. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She wanted to communicate an issue, which is necessary. The problem was how she framed the question, but the husband's reaction is also a problem. However, the question is whether the author is wrong. Since she had a valid reason to bring it up, even if the approach could be better, I think she's not in the wrong. The husband's response made things worse. So answer B.\n"
