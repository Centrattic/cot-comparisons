I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 24-year-old woman, is married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and is feeling frustrated. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he took as a loaded question. She told him she hadn't had one since October, and he reacted by getting angry, groaning, and then yelling that she always attacks him. He's upset with her approach, and even after she apologized, he's still acting out by slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is expressing a legitimate concern about her lack of sexual satisfaction in the marriage. This is a sensitive topic, and bringing it up can be uncomfortable for both partners. The way she approached it might have been abrupt, especially asking him about his last orgasm first. That could have made him feel defensive or criticized. \n\nBut the key point is whether she's in the wrong. The husband's reaction seems to be over the top. Getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and sending passive-aggressive messages after she apologized doesn't sound healthy. His response might indicate that he's not open to addressing the issue constructively. However, the author's initial action was to communicate her frustration, which is understandable. \n\nThe problem might be in how she framed the question. Leading with a question about his last orgasm before addressing her own could be seen as accusatory. But even if the approach was unideal, the husband's response of becoming angry and not addressing the underlying issue is problematic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation is complex. The author had a valid reason to bring up the issue, but perhaps the method could have been more considerate. However, the husband's reaction and refusal to engage constructively after she apologized might place the blame more on him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the husband's behavior is more hostile and uncooperative, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that her approach contributed to the conflict. \n\nI need to decide if her action was wrong. If the husband is reacting in a way that's hurtful, maybe she's not the one at fault. The core issue is communication breakdown. The author tried to address a problem, and the husband responded defensively. The answer might hinge on whether initiating the conversation is wrong. In healthy relationships, partners should be able to discuss such issues without anger. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the husband's response is the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
