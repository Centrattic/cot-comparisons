I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is married and hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She approaches her husband about it, but the way she does it seems off. She starts by asking him when he last had an orgasm, which he perceives as a loaded question. Then she tells him she hasn't had one since October. His reaction is defensive and angry. He accuses her of attacking him and not being satisfied with his efforts. The author apologizes, but her husband's response is still hostile, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe main issue here is communication. The author's approach might be seen as confrontational. She starts with a question that he interprets as loaded, which could make him defensive. Instead of directly addressing her own lack of satisfaction, maybe she should have framed it in a way that invites collaboration rather than blame. For example, expressing her feelings without directly comparing to his experiences might have been more constructive.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction is also problematic. Reacting with anger and defensiveness when his wife brings up a sensitive topic isn't healthy. He should be open to discussing her concerns without taking it personally. However, the initial question from the author might have contributed to the tension by being phrased in a way that could be seen as accusatory.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The key here is how the author communicated her issue. If she approached it without blame and expressed her feelings in a non-accusatory way, maybe the conversation would have gone better. However, given that she hasn't had an orgasm in six months, it's a valid concern, and she's trying to address it. The husband's response is definitely not ideal, but the author's approach could be improved.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible that she could have communicated more effectively. But is that being in the wrong? Or is it a miscommunication that both partners could learn from? The husband's response is not okay, but the author's initial approach might have made it harder. Maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her approach was confrontational and could have been more constructive. But I'm a bit torn because the husband's reaction is also bad. However, the question is about the author's actions specifically.\n"
