I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The husband reacted negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Open communication in a relationship is usually important. The woman brought up a sensitive topic, which is sexual satisfaction. She was honest about her frustration. The husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which might indicate that he felt attacked or didn't know how to handle the conversation. \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong to tell him. Arguably, she had a right to express her feelings, especially regarding intimacy. The problem might not be in her bringing it up, but in how they communicated. However, the way she approached it could matter. She asked a loaded question and then stated her own experience. The husband's response was over the top\u2014getting angry, slamming doors, not being constructive. \n\nTypically, in such scenarios, the onus is on both parties to communicate effectively. But the husband's reaction seems to be more of a problem. The woman was honest, which is generally a good step. The husband's defensiveness and anger are more concerning. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The husband's reaction is the issue here. She's trying to address a problem in their relationship, which is a valid thing to do. The husband's response is what's causing the conflict, not her initial statement.\n"
