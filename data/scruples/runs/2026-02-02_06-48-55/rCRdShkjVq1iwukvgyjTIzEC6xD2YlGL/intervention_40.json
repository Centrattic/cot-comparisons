I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to bring it up. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is frustrated and hasn't had an orgasm in a while. She brought up the issue, which is a valid concern. Communication in a relationship is important, especially regarding intimacy. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question, which she admitted, and her husband reacted poorly. But the root issue is that there's a problem with their sexual relationship, which she's trying to address.\n\nOn the husband's side, his reaction was defensive and angry. He didn't seem to listen to her concerns and instead became hostile. That's a red flag because a healthy relationship requires listening and working through issues together. His response of \"everything I do is wrong\" suggests he's taking her feedback personally, which might indicate a lack of willingness to address the problem.\n\nNow, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong for bringing up the issue. In most cases, initiating a conversation about sexual dissatisfaction isn't inherently wrong. It's a valid thing to discuss. However, the method of communication matters. If she approached him in a way that was accusatory or made him feel attacked, that could have triggered a defensive response. But in this case, she was honest about her frustration and stated her own experience, which is a more direct but perhaps blunt approach.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be more about his own defensiveness and possible insecurity rather than the actual content of her statement. The fact that he's slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies shows he's not handling the situation well. That suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously, which is a problem on his side.\n\nThe wife's intent was to communicate her dissatisfaction, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The husband's response is unconstructive. So, the author isn't in the wrong for bringing up the issue. The problem lies more with how the husband reacted and his refusal to engage constructively. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
