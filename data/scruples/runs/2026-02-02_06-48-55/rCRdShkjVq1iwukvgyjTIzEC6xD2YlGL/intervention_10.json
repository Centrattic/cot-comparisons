I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe woman is married and hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She brought this up to her husband, asking when he last had one. He reacted with a groan and got angry, saying she's always attacking him. She apologized but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here: communication in a relationship, especially about intimate issues. The woman is expressing her frustration about not feeling satisfied in the marriage bed. She approached her husband directly but maybe in a way that he perceived as accusatory. He responded defensively and angrily. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, bringing up a legitimate concern is important for a healthy relationship. However, the way she asked\u2014\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d\u2014might have come across as a criticism. Maybe she could have framed it differently, like expressing her own feelings rather than asking about his. But the issue is about her not having orgasms, which is her problem to address. \n\nHer husband's reaction is problematic. He got angry and defensive instead of listening. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she had a valid concern and communicated it, even if the method wasn't perfect, she's not entirely at fault. However, maybe there's a better way to approach such a sensitive topic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and the reasonableness of both parties. The woman's intention was to express her dissatisfaction, which is understandable. The husband's response was unhelpful and hurtful. So, she might not be the asshole here. But maybe she could have handled it better. However, the main issue is her lack of satisfaction, which is her right to bring up. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). She's not the asshole. She's trying to communicate a problem, even if the approach could be improved. The husband's overreaction is more concerning.\n"
