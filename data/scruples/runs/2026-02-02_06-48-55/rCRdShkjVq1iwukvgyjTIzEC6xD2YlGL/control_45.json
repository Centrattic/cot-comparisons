I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the 24-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is married, and the woman hasn't had an orgasm since October. She approaches her husband while they're driving, asking when he last had an orgasm. She then tells him she hasn't had one in six months. His reaction is defensive\u2014calling it a loaded question, getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles and the context. The woman brought up her frustration about their sexual relationship. She might have expected a constructive conversation. However, her approach was direct and possibly confrontational, especially in a car, which might not be the best setting. Her husband's reaction is emotional and defensive, indicating he felt attacked. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's expressing her feelings and needs, which is important in a relationship. However, the way she approached it might have been unhelpful. The husband's reaction is problematic\u2014being angry and defensive without addressing the issue. However, the woman's intention was to communicate her dissatisfaction, which is valid. \n\nThe husband's response suggests he's not handling the conversation well, but the woman is not at fault for expressing her needs. The problem lies more in how he reacted. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she's addressing her needs, even if the method could be improved. However, the situation is complex. But according to the question, the key is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's the one raising a legitimate concern, albeit in a possibly inopportune way, the answer is B.\n"
