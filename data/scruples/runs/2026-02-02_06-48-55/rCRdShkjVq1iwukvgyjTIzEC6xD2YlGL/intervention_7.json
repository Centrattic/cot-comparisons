I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to bring it up by asking her husband when he last had one. He reacted negatively, feeling attacked and defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of communication in relationships. The author did express her frustration, which is valid. Not having orgasms can be a serious issue in a marriage, affecting intimacy and satisfaction. But the way she approached the question was confrontational. She asked when he last had an orgasm, which could be seen as a loaded or accusatory question. The husband's reaction is understandable if he felt criticized, as his response was defensive and angry. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's honest about her problem, but the method of communication might be the issue. The husband was upset by the phrasing, leading to conflict. Maybe she should have approached the topic more gently, focusing on her own experience rather than putting him on the spot. However, she did apologize, so she might be trying to make amends. \n\nThe husband's half-hearted apology and slamming doors could indicate he's not handling the situation well either. But the question is about the author's actions. Bringing up the issue is important, but the approach matters. The author might not be the asshole if her intention was to address the problem, but the way she did it could be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether starting the conversation with a direct, potentially accusatory question is considered the wrong approach. If the husband felt attacked, then maybe the author's method was flawed, even if the intent was good. But if her intent was to open a dialogue and she apologized, that might mitigate it. \n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong because of the confrontational approach, but maybe B because she's addressing a legitimate issue. Need to decide based on the context provided.\n"
