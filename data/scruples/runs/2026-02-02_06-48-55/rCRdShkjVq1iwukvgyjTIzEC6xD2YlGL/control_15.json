I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and felt frustrated. She asked her husband when he last had one. He reacted negatively, getting angry and defensive. She apologized for the way she approached it, but he's still upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. Bringing up a sensitive topic like sexual dissatisfaction can be tough. The way she approached it might have been a loaded question, as her husband pointed out. Maybe she could have framed it differently to avoid making him feel attacked. But her reason for asking was valid\u2014she's not getting satisfaction and wanted to address it. \n\nHusband's reaction was anger and defensiveness. That's not ideal. Instead of addressing the issue, he shut down and got upset. Maybe he feels blamed, which is why he reacted that way. But the fact that she's not getting fulfillment is a real issue. \n\nIs she at fault? Well, maybe the way she asked could have been better, but the underlying problem is legitimate. She's trying to communicate a problem, which is important. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the question is about her. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's trying to address a valid concern, even if the method could be improved. The husband's response is more the issue here.\n"
