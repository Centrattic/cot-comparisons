I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and bringing up the topic in a way that upset him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman is married, 24, hasn't had an orgasm since October. She was frustrated and asked her husband when he last had one. He reacted with a loud groan, felt attacked, got angry while driving, and started shouting. She apologized but he's still upset, slamming doors, and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe key points here are communication in a relationship. The woman is expressing her dissatisfaction with their sex life. It's her right to express her feelings, even if the approach might have been rough. However, the way she brought it up\u2014maybe during a drive when he couldn't focus\u2014could have contributed to his anger. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, wanting to address a problem in the relationship isn't the issue. The problem might be how she approached it. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. Then she told him she hasn't had an orgasm, which could make him defensive. His reaction is also problematic\u2014he's getting angry and not addressing the issue but instead focusing on her approach. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If one partner is unhappy, it's important to talk about it, but the method matters. However, the husband's response seems to be deflecting and not taking her feelings seriously. The woman's actions stem from frustration and a desire for intimacy, which is valid. The husband's reaction is more concerning here. \n\nSo, the woman isn't in the wrong for expressing her needs. The issue is more about how they communicate and address these issues. The husband should be open to discussing problems rather than becoming defensive. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
