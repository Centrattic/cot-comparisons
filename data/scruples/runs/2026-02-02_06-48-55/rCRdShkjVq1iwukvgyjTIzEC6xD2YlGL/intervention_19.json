I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 24-year-old married woman who hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She's frustrated and brings this up to her husband by asking when he last had an orgasm. He responds defensively, gets angry, and there's a lot of shouting and slamming doors. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is usually encouraged, especially in matters as intimate as this. The author is expressing her frustration, which is a legitimate concern. Not having orgasms can affect her well-being and the relationship dynamics. However, the way she approached the conversation might have been a factor. She asked a question that she acknowledged was loaded, which might have put her husband on the defensive. \n\nHer husband's reaction is also important. He felt attacked and responded with anger. That's a problem because it's not a constructive response. However, the initial question might have been framed in a way that could be perceived as accusatory. If she had framed it differently, maybe focusing on her own feelings rather than making a direct comparison, he might have reacted differently. For example, starting with \"I've been feeling frustrated lately...\" instead of asking about his last orgasm could have been less confrontational.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? She's voicing a concern that's valid and important. Even if the approach could have been better, the core issue is her dissatisfaction in the relationship. The husband's reaction seems to be the main problem\u2014he's not handling the feedback well. However, sometimes people react poorly to criticism, even when it's necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, she could have approached the conversation more gently. Maybe choosing a time when they weren't in the middle of driving, where emotions might not be as heightened. Also, using \"I\" statements to express her feelings instead of a direct question about his experiences might have helped. \n\nIn terms of fault, the husband's reaction is definitely problematic. But the author is not entirely without fault if the way she framed the question contributed to the conflict. However, the primary responsibility for the escalation lies with the husband's defensive and angry response. The author is seeking to address a real issue, which is important. So, while she could improve her communication style, she's not necessarily in the wrong for bringing up a legitimate concern.\n"
