I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (a woman who told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months) is in the wrong. The husband got angry and responded poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author hasn't had an orgasm in six months, which is a significant period. She approached her husband about it, probably hoping to address the issue. Her question was likely to start a conversation about their sex life. The husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which seems unhealthy. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is at fault. The husband's anger might stem from feeling criticized or attacked, but the root issue is the lack of physical satisfaction. In a relationship, communication is key. If the author felt frustrated, expressing it was necessary. However, the way she asked the question might have been a \"loaded question,\" as the husband noted. Maybe she could have approached it more gently, but the intent was to share her feelings. \n\nThe husband's response\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and half-hearted apologies\u2014indicates a lack of emotional support. The author's action was about her own needs, while the husband's reaction was dismissive. In such cases, the person initiating the conversation isn't necessarily the one at fault, especially if the other person is uncooperative. \n\nBut some might argue that the author could have found a better way to communicate her needs without triggering a negative reaction. However, given the husband's defensive behavior, the problem might be his inability to handle feedback rather than the author's approach. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, even if the method was a bit direct. The husband's response was the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
