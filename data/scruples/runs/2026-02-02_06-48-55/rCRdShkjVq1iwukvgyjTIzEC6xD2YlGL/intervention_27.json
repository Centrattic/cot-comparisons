I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to confront her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is feeling frustrated because she's not getting satisfaction in their sex life. She asks her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he takes as a criticism. He reacts angrily, blaming himself and then her. She apologizes but the situation escalates.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles and mutual understanding. The wife's approach might have been harsh, but she was expressing her frustration. The husband's reaction is defensive and angry, which might indicate he's sensitive about the topic. However, the wife's question could be seen as a loaded one, as the husband pointed out. But she did apologize after realizing the approach was problematic. \n\nThe husband slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies isn't healthy either. Both parties might be at fault here. The wife's initial question might not be the best way to address the issue, but her intention was to open a discussion. The husband's reaction is over the top. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of validation, the user might be looking for reassurance that the wife's actions were justified or if she should have handled it differently. The question is whether the wife is the asshole (AITA). In these kinds of situations, open communication is key. If the wife felt she needed to express her dissatisfaction, she might have approached it in a way that was triggering for her husband. Alternatively, the husband might not have handled the criticism well. \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the answer isn't a straightforward A or B. But according to the user's initial thought, they lean towards A. However, the husband's response is also problematic. The question is about the wife's fault. She asked a direct question, which might have been a mistake, but she apologized. The husband's reaction is more extreme. So perhaps the wife isn't entirely in the wrong. But she could have approached it more carefully. Maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
