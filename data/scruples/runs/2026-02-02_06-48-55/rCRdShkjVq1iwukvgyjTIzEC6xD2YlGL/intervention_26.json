I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had orgasms in six months.\n\nFirst, the author shares a personal issue about not having orgasms. That's a sensitive topic in a relationship. She approached it during a moment of frustration, which might have affected the tone. Her husband reacted angrily, feeling attacked. She apologized, but he continued to act out. \n\nI need to consider communication styles. The author's question might have been blunt, especially in the context of a car ride where emotions can run high. Her husband's reaction suggests he felt criticized, which could stem from feeling defensive or inadequate. However, bringing up a lack of sexual satisfaction is a legitimate concern in a marriage. \n\nBut the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a loaded question in a way that made him feel blamed. The husband's response shows he felt attacked, leading to conflict. The author did apologize, but maybe the initial approach could have been more constructive. \n\nOn the other hand, not communicating such issues can lead to long-term resentment. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address her needs. However, the method and timing might have been unhelpful. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of both. She had a valid concern but might have handled it poorly. The husband's reaction is also an issue, as it's unhealthy to escalate into anger and slamming doors. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nI think the key is whether her approach was constructive. Since she did apologize, maybe the main issue was the initial approach. So, maybe answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way she communicated her frustration, but I'm a bit conflicted because the underlying issue is important. However, in terms of the situation described, her method led to conflict, so she's partially at fault.\n"
