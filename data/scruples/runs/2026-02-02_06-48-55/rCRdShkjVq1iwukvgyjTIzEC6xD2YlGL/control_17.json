I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves a communication breakdown between them.\n\nFirst, the wife hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is a significant issue in their marital sex life. She brought up the topic by asking her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he perceived as a loaded question. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles and mutual understanding. The wife was honest about her lack of orgasms, which could be seen as a valid concern. However, the way she approached it might have been the problem. She asked a potentially confrontational question first, which could have made him feel accused rather than approached as a partner to solve the issue together. His response was negative, but that doesn't necessarily mean the wife was wrong for initiating the conversation. The husband's defensiveness and anger are also part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate needs in a non-confrontational way. The wife's approach might have been too direct or accusatory, which could explain his negative reaction. However, the fact that she's bringing up a serious issue that affects her well-being is on her side. The husband's response was unhelpful and hostile, which is not ideal. \n\nSo, is the wife in the wrong? Probably not entirely. She had a legitimate concern and tried to communicate it, even if the method wasn't perfect. The husband's reaction was overly defensive and hurtful. But maybe there's room for her to have approached the conversation differently to avoid triggering him. However, since the core issue is her lack of orgasm, which is a valid problem, the blame isn't solely on her. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (No).\n"
