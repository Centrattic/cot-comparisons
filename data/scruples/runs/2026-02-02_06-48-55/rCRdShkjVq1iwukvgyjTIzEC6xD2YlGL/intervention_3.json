I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and discussing it during a conversation. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The wife brings up a personal issue, which is her lack of orgasms. She asks her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he perceives as a loaded question. He gets defensive and angry, reacting with a loud groan and accusations that he's awful. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling attacked rather than addressing her concern. \n\nThe author apologized for the way she approached the question, which suggests she recognized the method might have been poor, but the core issue of her not having orgasms is a valid concern. The problem here might be how the question was framed. Using \"when's the last time you had an orgasm?\" could be seen as a challenge, making the husband defensive. Alternatively, a more constructive approach might be sharing her feelings about their intimacy without directly comparing their experiences.\n\nHowever, the husband's overreaction is also significant. His immediate defensiveness and shouting indicate he might have been avoiding the issue or feeling insecure. His response of slamming doors and sending insincere apologies further shows a lack of willingness to address the problem constructively.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author's intention was to communicate a problem, which is reasonable. However, the way she communicated it might have been confrontational. But the husband's hostile reaction and unwillingness to engage in a healthy dialogue also contribute to the conflict. \n\nSo, while the author could have approached the topic differently, the husband's response was equally problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she had a valid issue and tried to address it, even if imperfectly, and the husband's reaction was inappropriate, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. But there's a nuance here.\n"
