I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple discussing their sexual satisfaction. The wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and brings it up by asking her husband when he last had one. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and defensive. The author is wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The wife is trying to communicate a problem in her marriage, which is important for a healthy relationship. Sexual satisfaction is a valid concern, and bringing it up is a reasonable step. However, the way she approached it by asking about his last orgasm might have been a loaded or accusatory question, which could have triggered his defensive reaction.\n\nThe husband's response seems to be more about deflection and anger rather than addressing the issue. He didn't engage constructively but instead blamed her for attacking him. That's a poor reaction, but the wife's method of communication might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nThe key question here is whether the wife's approach was appropriate. While her intent was to express her frustration and seek improvement, the phrasing could be seen as confrontational. It's possible that a more direct and less accusatory way of communicating her needs would have been better. However, the husband's overreaction and subsequent behavior (slamming doors, half-hearted apologies) indicate significant issues in how he handles communication and conflict.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial, but the manner in which it's done matters. The wife isn't wrong for bringing up the issue, but the approach could have been more constructive. The husband's response is problematic, but the wife's method of raising the issue might share some responsibility. \n\nHowever, the core issue is that the wife is trying to address a legitimate concern. The husband's reaction doesn't excuse the problem, but the way she asked might have made it harder to resolve. So, considering both perspectives, the wife isn't entirely in the wrong, but neither is she entirely right. However, since the question is binary (A or B), the better answer would be B (not in the wrong) because her concern is valid, and while her approach could be improved, it doesn't make her the asshole.\n"
