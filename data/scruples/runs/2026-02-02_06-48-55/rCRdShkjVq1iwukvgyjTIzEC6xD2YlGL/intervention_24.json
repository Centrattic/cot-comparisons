I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband about not having orgasms. The situation is that the author hasn't had an orgasm in six months and finally brought it up, leading to her husband getting upset and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a marriage where there's a communication issue regarding sexual satisfaction. She asked about the last time she had an orgasm, which might have been a sensitive way to approach the problem. Her husband reacted negatively, getting angry and defensive. She apologized, but he's still upset and slamming doors, sending half-hearted apologies. The author is questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main issue is communication in a marriage about a sensitive topic. The user is asking if the author is wrong for bringing it up. The possible answers are A for yes (author is in the wrong) or B for no.\n\nI need to consider the context. It's common for couples to have issues with communication about sex. The author hasn't had an orgasm in six months, which is a significant issue. Bringing it up is a valid concern, but the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked about his last orgasm first, which might have come off as accusatory or a loaded question, as he mentioned. That could have triggered his defensive reaction.\n\nIn healthy relationships, discussing sexual dissatisfaction is important. However, the method of communication matters. If the conversation is confrontational, it can lead to defensiveness and conflict. The author's approach might not have been ideal. Instead of comparing their experiences, maybe a more collaborative conversation would have been better. But the root issue is a lack of mutual satisfaction, which is her husband's responsibility to address as well.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems extreme and unhealthy. Yelling, slamming doors, and not taking responsibility are signs of poor conflict resolution. He should address his own behavior instead of deflecting. However, the author's initial question might have been a poor choice in phrasing, leading to the conflict. So, while the husband's reaction is wrong, the author's approach might have contributed to the situation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the issue is about communication, and she had a valid reason to bring it up, but perhaps the way she did might not have been the best. However, the main problem is the lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a legitimate issue to discuss. The husband's response is more indicative of the problem, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong. It's a shared responsibility in the communication breakdown.\n\nBut according to the options, I have to choose between A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious. From a perspective of communication, the author tried to address the issue, even if the method was flawed. The husband's reaction is clearly problematic. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since she had a valid reason to express her dissatisfaction, even if the approach was not perfect, the primary fault isn't hers. The husband's response is more indicative of being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (no). But I need to be careful here. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit often looks at intentions and actions. The author's intention was to express her issue, which is reasonable. The husband's response is the asshole behavior, not the author's for bringing it up. So the answer is B.\n"
