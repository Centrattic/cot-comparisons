I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had orgasms in six months. The situation is about communication in a marriage.\n\nFirst, the author brought up the issue of not having an orgasm in six months. She asked her husband when he last had one, which he perceived as a loaded question. His reaction was defensive and angry, which is a problem. But the core is whether she was wrong to bring it up.\n\nCommunication in relationships is crucial. If one partner is struggling with something like lack of sexual satisfaction, discussing it is important. However, the way she approached it might have been an issue. She says she asked him a loaded question, which he reacted to. Maybe the framing of the question could have been more constructive. Instead of asking about his last orgasm, perhaps she could have expressed her own feelings first, like \"I haven't been feeling satisfied lately, can we talk about it?\"\n\nBut her intention was to communicate her own frustration, which is valid. The problem might be in the approach, but not the act of bringing up the issue itself. Her husband's reaction was inappropriate and defensive. Slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies are signs of poor communication from his side. However, the question is about the author's actions. \n\nIs it wrong for her to express her feelings? I don't think so. The issue might be how she communicated it, but the act of communicating dissatisfaction is necessary. The husband's response was wrong, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for initiating the conversation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
