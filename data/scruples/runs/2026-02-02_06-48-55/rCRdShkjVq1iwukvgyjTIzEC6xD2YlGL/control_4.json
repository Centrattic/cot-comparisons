I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. She tells him when she last had one, and he reacts angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The wife's intention was to communicate her frustration about the lack of sexual satisfaction. She approached it by asking when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. Then she directly told him about her own experience. His reaction was defensive, angry, and he slammed doors and sent half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles. The wife's approach might have been confrontational by starting with a loaded question. However, the husband's reaction seems exaggerated and dismissive. He didn't listen to her concerns and instead focused on feeling attacked. His behavior\u2014yelling while driving, slamming doors, and not taking her seriously\u2014suggests he's not addressing the real issue, which is the lack of sexual satisfaction in the marriage.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. While the wife could have approached the topic differently, maybe with more empathy, the husband's response is more problematic. He's not taking responsibility or trying to understand her needs. Instead, he's deflecting and being hostile. \n\nThe question is whether the wife is in the wrong. While her approach could have been improved, the main issue is the husband's reaction. The wife was trying to communicate a serious problem that affects their relationship. The husband's response is more about his own defensiveness rather than solving the issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She was raising a valid concern, albeit a sensitive one, and the husband's reaction is inappropriate. The problem lies more with how he handled the situation rather than her bringing it up.\n"
