I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to bring it up to her husband. She asked him when the last time he had one, which led to a conflict. The husband reacted angrily, but the question is whether the wife is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is frustrated because she's not experiencing orgasms, which is a legitimate concern. Communication in a relationship is key, especially regarding intimacy. However, the way she approached the question might have been problematic. She asked about her husband's last orgasm as a comparison, which could be seen as a loaded or accusatory question. \n\nThe husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which isn't ideal either. He might feel attacked or blamed. The wife apologized, but the husband continued to act out. The key points here are about the approach of the wife and whether it was a reasonable way to express her frustration. \n\nI think bringing up the issue is important for the wife's well-being and the health of the marriage. However, the manner in which she brought it up could have been more constructive. Using a question that compares their experiences might have been triggering. The husband's response was unhelpful, but the wife initiating the conversation, albeit in a perhaps poor way, does not necessarily make her the asshole. She was trying to communicate a problem, even if the method wasn't the best. So I lean towards the wife not being in the wrong, but maybe she could have handled it differently. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
