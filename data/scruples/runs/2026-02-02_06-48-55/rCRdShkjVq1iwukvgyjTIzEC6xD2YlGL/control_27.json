I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The husband reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author expressed her feelings about their sex life, which is a valid concern. Not having orgasms can indicate issues that need addressing, so bringing it up isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems disproportionate. He got angry and defensive, which might suggest he's uncomfortable discussing this topic or feels criticized. However, his response was harsh, which is problematic. \n\nThe author's approach: she asked him a direct question, which he found loaded. Maybe she could have approached it differently, like expressing her feelings first instead of starting with a question about his last orgasm. But the issue here is about her right to express her dissatisfaction. \n\nThe husband slamming doors and being verbally aggressive is a red flag. Healthy communication is important, and his reaction is not appropriate. However, the question is about the author's actions. She did express her feelings, albeit in a way that might have been confrontational. But given the context of a marital relationship, discussing such matters is necessary for both partners' well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for bringing up her lack of orgasms. The husband's reaction is more indicative of a problem in how he handles communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
