I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple having issues with orgasms. The wife hasn't had one in six months and decided to bring it up to her husband. She asked him when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. The wife is now wondering if she was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The wife might feel frustrated and wants to communicate a problem in their sex life. It's important for a relationship to address such issues, so bringing it up could be seen as trying to improve their intimacy. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a \"loaded question,\" which he pointed out. Maybe the way she phrased it made him feel defensive or attacked. \n\nHer husband's reaction was loud and emotional, which is not healthy. Getting angry and using phrases like \"everything I do is wrong\" suggests he took it personally. But does that mean the wife was in the wrong? Or is it his reaction that's the issue? The wife apologized, but he continued to act out. \n\nThe key points here are communication style and the husband's response. While the wife had a valid concern, the husband's defensive and angry reaction is not appropriate. However, initiating the conversation in a way that caused immediate defensiveness might not have been the best approach. The wife could have tried a different method, like expressing her feelings without directly comparing or using a loaded question. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If the problem is real and needs addressing, then bringing it up isn't inherently wrong. The husband's response is more concerning. The wife's intention was to communicate a problem, not to attack. The question is whether her method crossed a line. Since she apologized and the husband's reaction was extreme, maybe the fault isn't entirely hers. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she was trying to address a legitimate issue, even if the approach could be improved. The husband's overreaction is more problematic. However, if the way she asked was confrontational, maybe she should have been more tactful. But overall, the main issue is the husband's response, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
