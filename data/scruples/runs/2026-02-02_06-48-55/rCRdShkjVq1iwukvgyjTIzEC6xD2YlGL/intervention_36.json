I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband.\n\nFirst, the wife decides to tell her husband about her lack of orgasms. She asks him when he last had one, which he sees as a loaded question. He reacts angrily, and she ends up apologizing but he keeps acting out. The user thinks the author (the wife) is at fault, but the question is whether that's right.\n\nI need to consider communication in relationships. Bringing up sensitive topics can be tough. The wife's approach might have been abrupt. Instead of explaining her feelings first, she asked a direct question that could be perceived as a comparison or criticism. Her husband felt attacked, which led to his defensive reaction. However, the root issue is the lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nThe wife's intention was probably to address a problem affecting their relationship. But how she brought it up might have been ineffective. The husband's reaction is also problematic\u2014he's defensive and aggressive instead of listening. But the question is about the wife's fault. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both have roles. The wife could have approached it more gently, and the husband should handle criticism better. However, the user asks if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it implies she's at fault. If B (no), then she's not. \n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, initiating difficult conversations is important, even if the delivery could be improved. The key issue here is that the wife is addressing a problem that affects her well-being. While her method might not have been ideal, bringing up the issue isn't inherently wrong. The husband's overreaction doesn't justify the approach, but the act of seeking resolution isn't necessarily the fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because she's addressing a valid issue, even if the communication could be better. The husband's response is more concerning, but the question is about her being in the wrong. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
