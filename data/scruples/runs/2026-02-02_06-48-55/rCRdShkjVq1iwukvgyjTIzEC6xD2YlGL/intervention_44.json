I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is about communication in a marriage regarding sexual satisfaction.\n\nFirst, the author brought up the issue directly. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. She then told him she hadn't had one since October. His reaction was defensive and angry, and he took it personally. She apologized but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending insincere apologies. The author is seeking validation if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. Bringing up a personal issue like lack of orgasms isn't inherently wrong. However, how she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question first, which could have made her husband feel attacked. Then she revealed her own issue without giving him a chance to respond constructively. Her husband's reaction is poor, but the initial approach could have been more empathetic. Maybe she should have approached the conversation with more care to avoid making him feel defensive. However, the root issue is a lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a valid concern. The husband's response is definitely problematic, but the way she brought it up might have contributed to his defensiveness. So, she's not entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B) because the core issue is valid, but her approach could be critiqued. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and the husband's reaction is extreme, maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, if the approach was too confrontational, maybe A. But I think in AITA scenarios, being honest about a marital issue isn't the wrong, especially if the husband is being defensive. So probably B.\n"
