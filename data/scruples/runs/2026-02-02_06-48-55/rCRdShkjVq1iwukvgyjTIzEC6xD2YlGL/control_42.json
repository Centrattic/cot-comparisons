I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is 24, married to a 25-year-old. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months, and she's frustrated. She brings it up by asking her husband when he last had an orgasm. He reacts negatively, gets angry, and they argue. Now, she's wondering if she's the asshole here, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nThe key points here are communication in relationships and how to address sensitive topics. The author's intention was to express her frustration and perhaps seek a solution. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a question that could be seen as accusatory or leading, which led to her husband's defensive reaction. \n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is important, but how you communicate matters. Bringing up a personal issue is valid, but the method can affect the outcome. The husband's reaction was angry and defensive, which might indicate that he felt attacked, even if her intent wasn't to attack. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to consider if her action (bringing up the lack of orgasms) is inherently wrong, regardless of the husband's response. Since she's trying to address a problem that affects both of them, she's not in the wrong for wanting to discuss it. However, the approach might need to be more considerate and less confrontational. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to communicate her needs. However, the way she framed the question could be improved. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the act of communicating the issue isn't the problem. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
