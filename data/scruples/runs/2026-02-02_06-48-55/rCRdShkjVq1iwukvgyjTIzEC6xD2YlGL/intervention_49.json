I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked him when he last had one, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months, which is a significant period. She approached the topic directly, asking her husband about his last orgasm, which he felt was a loaded question. His reaction was defensive and angry, which she might have found hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles. The woman's approach might have been abrupt or not the best way to discuss a sensitive topic. However, she's expressing a legitimate concern about their sexual relationship. Her husband's response was to feel attacked and defensive, which could indicate issues in how they communicate. \n\nIn relationships, how we approach sensitive topics matters. If she had come to him with her feelings first and then discussed their experiences together, maybe the conversation would have been more productive. But she did bring up her own experience, so she's not entirely in the wrong for expressing her needs. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling criticized rather than addressing the issue. His defensiveness might stem from his own insecurities or communication problems. However, the woman's method of confronting the issue might have been too direct or not framed in a way that invites collaboration. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. She's not wrong for bringing up the issue because communication is essential. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. But overall, she's addressing a valid concern, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The husband's anger is his response, not her fault entirely. She's seeking to communicate a problem, which is necessary in a relationship. So, the answer is B.\n"
