I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and she told her husband. She asked him when he last had one, which he found loaded. He reacted angrily, and she's now wondering if she was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is sharing a personal issue that's important for their relationship. Communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. But maybe she brought it up in a way that made him defensive. The husband's reaction seems harsh, but maybe there's more to his side. However, the question is about the author's actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe she didn't approach the conversation in a constructive way. She asked a question that could be seen as accusatory. Instead of expressing her frustration in a non-confrontational manner, she used a loaded question. That might have triggered his defensiveness. On the other hand, she's honest about her frustration, which is valid. The husband's response\u2014getting angry, slamming doors, and not addressing the issue\u2014could indicate poor communication skills on his part. But does that make the author right?\n\nThe key here is whether her approach was inappropriate. Asking \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" could be seen as a challenge, especially if the context is her own lack of orgasms. Maybe a better approach would be to express her needs and feelings without comparing or confronting. However, it's also important to address issues that affect both partners. The husband's reaction is clearly problematic, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nIn relationships, initiating difficult conversations is important, but the method matters. If the author had framed it as a mutual problem rather than a criticism, maybe the response would have been different. But she did express her feelings, even if the way she did it might have been tactless. The husband's anger and defensiveness are his responsibility, but the author could have approached it differently. However, the user is asking if she's in the wrong. Given that she was honest and tried to communicate, even if imperfectly, maybe she's not the asshole. On the other hand, if the way she brought it up was unnecessarily hurtful, then she might share some responsibility. But given the context of a long-standing issue (six months), her frustration is understandable. The husband's reaction is more clearly a problem, but the question is about her. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. Alternatively, maybe A if her approach was too confrontational. Hmm. It's a tricky one. I think the key is that while the husband's reaction is worse, the author could have approached it differently. But does that make her in the wrong? Maybe not the asshole, but could have done better. So the answer might be B.\n"
