I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife is 24, her husband 25. They have sex often, but she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. Today, she asked him when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and defensive. She then told him she hasn't had one since October. His reaction was to groan, accuse himself of being bad, and then lash out, saying she always attacks him. He's upset with her approach, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe key points here are communication and approach. The wife wanted to address her dissatisfaction but perhaps did it in a way that made her husband feel attacked. She framed the question as \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which might come off as accusatory. However, her intention was to express her own frustration. The husband's reaction is defensive and angry, which complicates things.\n\nNow, determining if she's in the wrong. In relationships, communication is crucial. If one partner is experiencing dissatisfaction in intimacy, it's important to address it. However, the method of communication matters. The wife's question might have been a bit abrupt or confrontational, especially since it's a sensitive topic. The husband's reaction is not ideal either\u2014he's defensive and angry instead of being open to discussion. \n\nBut the core issue is her lack of orgasms lasting six months. That's a significant problem that needs addressing. She's trying to bring it up, which is a valid concern. The problem is how she approached it. Instead of leading with her own experience, she asked about his, which could make him feel blamed. A better approach might be to express her own feelings first, like \"I haven't been able to have an orgasm in a while, and I'm feeling frustrated. How can we work on this together?\" That way, she's not directly accusing him but sharing her experience.\n\nHowever, even if the approach could be improved, the act of bringing up a legitimate issue isn't necessarily wrong. The husband's reaction is problematic because he's deflecting and getting angry instead of engaging constructively. The wife's intent was to communicate her needs, which is not wrong. The husband's response, though, is more at fault here. \n\nBut the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the approach. If she had a better way to communicate her needs but chose a confrontational method, she might share some responsibility. However, the situation is more about the husband not responding appropriately. Since she's trying to address a valid issue, even if the method could be improved, she's not entirely in the wrong. The main issue is the husband's reaction, not necessarily her bringing it up. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
