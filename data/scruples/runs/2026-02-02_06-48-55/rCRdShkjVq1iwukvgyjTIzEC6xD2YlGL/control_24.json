I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe woman is 24, married to a 25-year-old. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months. When she brings it up, her husband reacts negatively. She asked him when he last had an orgasm, and he called it a loaded question. Then she told him she hadn't had one since October. He got angry, yelled, and now there's conflict. She's seeking validation.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication issues and the husband's reaction. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I know about relationships, open communication is key, especially regarding intimacy. If there's a problem that's affecting the relationship, bringing it up is part of trying to resolve it. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a loaded question first, which could have made her husband defensive. But then she shared her own experience, which is a valid concern. His reaction seems to be a problem\u2014getting angry and defensive instead of addressing the issue. \n\nThe husband's response with a loud groan and accusations that he's awful suggests he might not be handling the situation well. The fact that he's slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies also points to his immaturity in the situation. \n\nThe author apologized, but the husband's reaction seems to be the bigger issue. She's trying to address her needs, which is reasonable. So, in this context, she's not the asshole. The husband's behavior is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
