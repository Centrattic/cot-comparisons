I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and how the situation unfolded.\n\nFirst, the author is married, 24, and hasn't had an orgasm since October. She brought up the issue by asking her husband when the last time he had one. He reacted negatively, got angry, and started shouting. She apologized, but he's still acting out.\n\nI need to assess if she's in the wrong. The core issue here is communication in a relationship. The author was honest about her lack of orgasms, which is a legitimate concern. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. Maybe the timing or the context of the question during a drive could have contributed to his stress.\n\nBut his reaction seems extreme. Getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and sending half-hearted apologies is not healthy. The key point is whether her action was a reasonable way to express her frustration. While being honest is important, the manner of communication matters. However, the husband's response is clearly over the top and unhelpful. \n\nThe author apologized, so she took responsibility for the approach, which suggests she's trying to resolve the issue. The husband isn't handling the feedback well, which is his responsibility. The author's intent was to address a problem, which is a valid reason to communicate. So, the main issue is his reaction, not her bringing it up. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
