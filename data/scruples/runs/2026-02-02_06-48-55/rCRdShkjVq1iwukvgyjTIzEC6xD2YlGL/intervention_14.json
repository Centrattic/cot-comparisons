I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. She asked when he last had one, and he reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is sharing her frustration about not having an orgasm, which is a valid concern. Communication in relationships is crucial, and bringing up issues that affect intimacy is important. However, the way she approached it might be problematic. She asked a loaded question, which the husband noted. Then she revealed her own lack of orgasms, which might have made him defensive.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be anger and defensiveness. He accuses her of attacking him and not finding him good enough. His response might indicate that he didn't handle the conversation well either. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nIs she in the wrong for bringing up a personal issue? Maybe not inherently. But the way she framed the question was loaded, which could have been unhelpful. She apologized, but he continued to act out. However, his reaction is extreme\u2014slamming doors, yelling, half-hearted apologies. That might indicate he's not handling the situation well either. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if she had a valid reason to express her feelings. Not having orgasms can be a significant issue in a relationship, and addressing it is important. The method of communication could be improved, but the act of bringing up the issue isn't necessarily wrong. The husband's response might be more at fault here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. She had a legitimate concern and tried to communicate it, even if the approach could be better. The husband's overreaction is problematic, but that doesn't make her entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
