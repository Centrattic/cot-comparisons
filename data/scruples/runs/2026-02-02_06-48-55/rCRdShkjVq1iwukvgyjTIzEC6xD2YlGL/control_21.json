I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is 24, married to a 25-year-old. She hasn't had an orgasm since October. She brings it up by asking her husband when he last had one, which he perceives as a loaded question. He reacts negatively, gets angry, and she apologizes, but he continues to be upset. Now she's seeking validation on whether she's the asshole here.\n\nThe main question is whether she was wrong to communicate her lack of orgasms. From a general perspective, open communication in a relationship is usually encouraged, especially regarding intimacy issues. If she's not getting satisfaction, it's important to address it. However, the way she approached it might be a factor. She asked a question that could be seen as confrontational, especially in the context of driving where it's harder to have a calm discussion.\n\nHer husband's reaction is also a point to consider. He seems defensive and angry, which might indicate that he's not ready to handle the conversation constructively. The problem isn't just about her asking, but how the conversation unfolded. She apologized, which shows she recognized the approach might not have been great, but his response was extreme, like slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of expressing her feelings isn't inherently wrong. The issue might be the method and timing. But the husband's overreaction is more concerning. If he's dismissing her needs and being hostile, that's a red flag. So while she could have approached it differently (maybe a more private and calm setting), the core issue of not having orgasms isn't her fault. \n\nThe key here is that the author is trying to address a legitimate concern, which is a common issue in many relationships. The husband's response is more indicative of a problem in handling communication. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for bringing it up; she's seeking a solution. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
