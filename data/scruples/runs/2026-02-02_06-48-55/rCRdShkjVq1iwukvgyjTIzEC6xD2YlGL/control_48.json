I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her husband that she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The husband reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. The author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is married and hasn't been able to achieve an orgasm for six months. That's a significant period and could indicate a problem in their sexual relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, especially regarding intimacy. The author approached the topic by asking her husband when he last had an orgasm, which might have been a way to open a dialogue about their sexual satisfaction. However, the husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which is problematic.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Let's think about intent. The author's intent was to express her frustration and perhaps initiate a constructive conversation. However, the way she approached it might have been confrontational. Asking a loaded question in the middle of a drive could be seen as not the best approach. But given the context, it's understandable she's frustrated. The husband's response was unhelpful and defensive, which suggests he might not be handling the situation well.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners have a role in maintaining a healthy sexual relationship. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address her lack of satisfaction. However, the method of bringing it up could have been more effective. But the husband's reaction\u2014getting angry, slamming doors, and making half-hearted apologies\u2014points to his own issues in handling the conversation. The author apologized for her approach, indicating she tried to de-escalate, but the husband continued to act out. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was the primary issue. While the approach could have been better, the husband's response seems more indicative of a problem in communication and emotional handling. The author isn't the one being abusive or dismissive; she's trying to communicate her needs. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
