I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is that the author, a 24-year-old woman, is married to a 25-year-old man. She says she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to tell her husband. She asked him when the last time he had one, which he found loaded. He got angry, accused her of attacking him, and now they're arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication in a relationship. Open and honest communication is usually seen as healthy. The author is expressing her frustration about a lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a valid concern. However, the way she approached it might be an issue. She asked him a question that could be perceived as confrontational. He reacted negatively, which is problematic too.\n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. She's sharing her own experience and asking her husband a direct question. Even if the question was loaded, she's voicing her needs. However, the way she approached it might have been harsh. The husband's reaction is also important to note. He's getting angry and defensive, which suggests he might not be handling the conversation well. But the author is trying to address a problem, so maybe she's not wrong. The husband's response is more about deflection and anger rather than addressing the issue. \n\nIn relationships, both parties have responsibility. The author is taking a step to communicate her needs, which is positive. It's possible that her approach could be adjusted for better communication, but the act of bringing up the issue isn't inherently wrong. The husband's reaction is more concerning. So the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
