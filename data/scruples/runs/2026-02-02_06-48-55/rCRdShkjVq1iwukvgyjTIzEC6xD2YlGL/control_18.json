I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The author is a woman who told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked him when he last had one, and he reacted angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is sharing her frustration about not having orgasms, which is a legitimate issue in a relationship. It's important for partners to communicate about sexual satisfaction. The husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which might indicate he felt attacked or criticized. The way she approached the question might have been a bit abrupt, especially asking during a drive, which could be a bad time. But the core issue is her honest communication about her needs.\n\nThe husband's response of getting angry and shutting down isn't helpful. Valid communication should be open and non-confrontational. The author apologized, but he's still acting out. The problem here might be more about the husband's inability to handle criticism and his defensive behavior rather than the author being wrong for expressing her feelings. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author is trying to address a real issue, the husband's reaction is problematic, and the approach might not have been perfect but the intent is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
