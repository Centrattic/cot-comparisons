I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the wife did something wrong by telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, the context: She hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is a long time. She brings it up because she's frustrated. She asks her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he takes as a loaded question. He reacts negatively, gets angry, and she apologizes, but he's still upset.\n\nThe key points here are communication and intent. She's trying to express her feelings of dissatisfaction in their sexual relationship. Bringing up her lack of orgasms is a way to initiate a conversation about intimacy. Her question might have been phrased in a way that could be taken as a criticism, but her intent was to share her own frustration.\n\nHe reacts defensively, which might indicate he's not comfortable discussing this topic or feels attacked. However, the fact that she's honest about her feelings isn't inherently wrong. In healthy relationships, open communication is encouraged, even if it's difficult. She's not attacking him; she's expressing her own needs. His reaction seems more about how he handled the conversation rather than the topic itself.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She's addressing an important issue in the relationship. The problem might lie in how she approached it, but the act of communicating her feelings isn't wrong. The husband's defensiveness and anger could be due to his own insecurities or communication issues. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
