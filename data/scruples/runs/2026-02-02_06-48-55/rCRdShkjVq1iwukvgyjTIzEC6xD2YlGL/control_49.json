I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asks her husband when he last had one, and he reacts negatively. She apologizes for the way she asked, but he's still upset. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife hasn't been experiencing pleasure in their sexual relationship, which is a significant issue. Communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. She brought up the topic because she's frustrated, which is understandable. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which the husband found loaded. Maybe she should have framed the conversation differently, perhaps focusing on her own feelings instead of his. For example, saying, \"I haven't been able to reach orgasm lately, and I'm feeling frustrated. How can we work on this together?\" That might have been less confrontational.\n\nBut then again, addressing a sexual issue isn't easy, and the husband's reaction seems overly defensive and angry. His response of blaming himself and then getting angry might indicate he felt attacked or that the conversation was a criticism of his performance. However, the wife's main issue is her own lack of satisfaction, which is a valid concern. The husband's immediate anger and shutting down the conversation by slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies suggest poor communication from his side as well.\n\nSo, the author (the wife) brought up a valid issue but might have approached it in a way that made her husband feel defensive. However, she did apologize, and the husband's reaction seems extreme. In healthy relationships, partners should be able to discuss such matters without one party becoming hostile. The husband's response might be part of the problem here. The wife isn't in the wrong for expressing her needs, but perhaps the method could have been better. However, since the husband's reaction is so negative, it's possible that the author isn't the one at fault. The key is that she's trying to communicate a problem, which is reasonable, even if the approach could have been improved. The husband's response is more indicative of the issue here. So, I think the answer is B (No).\n"
