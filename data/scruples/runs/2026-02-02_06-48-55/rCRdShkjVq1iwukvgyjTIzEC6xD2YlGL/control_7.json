I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is married, and she's been not having orgasms since October. Today, she asked her husband when he last had one. He reacted negatively, getting angry and upset, even slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. She's seeking validation on whether she was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are communication in a relationship and how both parties handled the situation. The author initiated a conversation about her lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a valid concern. However, her approach might have been abrupt or poorly timed, especially if she just came out with a loaded question without context. \n\nHer husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014getting angry, shouting, and being defensive. That's not healthy. But was the author's initial question wrong? Well, bringing up a personal issue can be tough, and the way she asked might have been a shock. But the core issue is her lack of orgasm, which is a legitimate problem in the relationship. \n\nIt's important to consider if there were other factors. Maybe there's underlying tension, or the husband feels criticized. However, the author didn't attack him; she shared her experience. The husband's response was disproportionate. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? I don't think so. She's addressing a real issue, even if the method could be improved. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
