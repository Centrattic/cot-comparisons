I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and shutting down.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is a significant period. She approached her husband while he was driving, which might have been a stressful or inconvenient time. She asked him when he last had an orgasm, which the husband considered a loaded question. His reaction was defensive, angry, and he accused her of attacking him. The wife then apologized but he continued to be upset, slamming doors and sending insincere apologies.\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important, but the context matters. The wife was trying to express her frustration, which is valid. However, the way she approached it might have been off. Asking during a drive when he's driving could be a bad time for such a sensitive topic. Also, the question about his last orgasm might have been confrontational and not the best way to express her own needs.\n\nThe husband's reaction was clearly negative and defensive. He didn't engage in a constructive conversation, instead lashing out. That's not healthy. However, the wife's initial approach might have contributed to the tension. She could have tried a different method, maybe a calmer discussion when both were relaxed.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The wife is expressing a legitimate concern about her lack of satisfaction, which is something that should be addressed in a relationship. But how she brought it up might have been problematic. The husband's reaction is also problematic because he's not taking responsibility and is becoming hostile instead of discussing the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, neither is entirely in the wrong. The wife has a valid issue, but her approach could be improved. The husband's response is inappropriate. However, the question is specifically about the wife's actions. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The wife's intent was to communicate her needs, which is not wrong. The mistake was in how she communicated it. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the nuance that her approach could have been better. However, according to AITA standards, if the person's actions were reasonable but the other person overreacted, they might not be the asshole. So I think the answer is B.\n"
