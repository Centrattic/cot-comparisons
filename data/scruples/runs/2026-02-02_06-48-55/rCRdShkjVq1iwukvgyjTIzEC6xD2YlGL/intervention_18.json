I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to bring it up. She asks her husband when he last had one, which he perceives as a loaded question. He reacts angrily, making her question if she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, communication in relationships is key. Bringing up a sensitive topic like this can be tough, but the way she approached it might have been a factor. She says she was frustrated and asked a question that led to his defensiveness. His reaction was anger and defensiveness, which isn't helpful, but does that mean she's in the wrong? Maybe she could have approached it differently, like using \"I\" statements to express her feelings without making him feel attacked. However, the issue of not having orgasms is a valid concern, and she's advocating for her needs. The husband's response seems overly reactive, which might indicate a problem in how he handles criticism, but the author's intent was to communicate a problem she's facing. So while her approach might not have been perfect, she's not entirely in the wrong. The key is whether she's responsible for his reaction. Since everyone communicates differently, maybe she could have chosen a better time or method, but the core issue is legitimate. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
