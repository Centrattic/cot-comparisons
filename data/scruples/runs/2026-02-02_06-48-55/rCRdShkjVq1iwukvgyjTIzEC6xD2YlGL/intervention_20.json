I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. She's frustrated and decides to ask her husband about his last orgasm. He responds defensively, getting angry and upset. She apologizes, but he's still acting out. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nHmm, communication in relationships is key. The woman was trying to discuss a problem that's been affecting her for months. She approached it by asking a question, which might have been a bit direct, but she was honest about her feelings. Her husband reacted negatively, which could indicate his own issues with communication or insecurity.\n\nIs the woman wrong for bringing up a legitimate concern? She's not attacking him out of nowhere; she's addressing a problem that's been there. Maybe she could have approached it differently, like using \"I\" statements instead of starting with a question that might feel accusatory. But the core issue is her lack of satisfaction, which is valid. The husband's reaction seems to be about his defensiveness rather than her being the problem.\n\nI think the woman isn't in the wrong. She's trying to communicate a serious issue. The husband's response is more about his inability to handle criticism or understand her perspective. Her apology wasn't enough because he's still angry, but that's on him. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
