I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronted her husband about it. She asked when the last time he had an orgasm was, which she admits was a loaded question. Her husband then reacted angrily, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the wife) is the asshole here. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, the wife's perspective: She's experiencing a lack of sexual satisfaction and decided to communicate her feelings. It's reasonable for her to want to address this issue in her marriage. However, the way she approached it by asking when the last time he had an orgasm was might have been confrontational. That question could be seen as accusatory, implying that the problem lies with him. \n\nOn the husband's side: He reacted with anger and defensiveness. His response was harsh, and he didn't handle the conversation constructively. He took it as an attack, which might indicate that he's not open to discussing the issue or feels blamed. His subsequent behavior\u2014slamming doors, sending inadequate apologies\u2014shows poor communication skills and emotional control.\n\nBut the key here is whether the wife was wrong for bringing up the issue. Open communication in a relationship is usually encouraged. However, the method of communication matters. The loaded question might not be the best approach. Instead of asking about his last orgasm, maybe discussing her own lack of satisfaction in a non-confrontational way would have been better. \n\nHusbands can sometimes feel criticized when partners bring up sexual dissatisfaction, leading to defensiveness. However, the wife's concern is valid. The husband's reaction of anger and shutting down the conversation is unhelpful. \n\nIn terms of fault, both could have handled it better. The wife could have framed her concerns more collaboratively, while the husband should have listened without reacting angrily. But the question is whether the author (wife) is in the wrong. Since her intent was to communicate a problem, even if the delivery was flawed, she isn't entirely at fault. The husband's overreaction is a bigger issue. However, the way she asked the question was confrontational. \n\nHmm. The community often looks at intent and context in AITA scenarios. The wife's intent was to address a problem, but her approach might have been inappropriate. However, the husband's response was clearly problematic. So, the answer might depend on whether the initial question was the main issue. If the user is asking if she's the asshole, the answer might be B (she's not) because the husband's reaction is more egregious. But some might argue that her approach was wrong. \n\nIn the AITA subreddit, people often consider the person the asshole if they acted inconsiderately, even if they have valid points. But in this case, the wife's issue is a legitimate marital problem. The husband's reaction is the bigger problem. So the answer would be B (she's not the asshole).\n"
