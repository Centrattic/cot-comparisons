I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronting him about it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and felt frustrated. She asked her husband when he last had one, which led to a conflict. He reacted negatively, getting angry and defensive.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Communication in relationships is crucial. The woman was honest about her feelings, which is important for a healthy relationship. However, the way she approached the question might have been a \"loaded question,\" as the husband pointed out. If she criticized his performance by comparing their experiences, that could be seen as an attack. \n\nOn the other hand, expressing dissatisfaction is necessary. The husband's reaction\u2014getting angry and defensive\u2014suggests he might be avoiding the issue or not taking her feelings seriously. The woman apologized for her approach, showing she's trying to resolve the issue. The husband's subsequent behavior (slamming doors, half-hearted apologies) isn't helpful either.\n\nSo, the key points: the woman's intent was to communicate her needs, but the method might have been confrontational. The husband's reaction is defensive and dismissive. Neither is entirely right or wrong, but the woman's intention to address the issue isn't necessarily wrong. However, the approach could have been more constructive. In relationships, how something is said matters as much as what is said. The husband's defensiveness is a problem too, but the question is about the woman's actions.\n\nConsidering all that, the woman isn't wrong for bringing up the issue. The problem might be in the method, but the core issue is the lack of satisfaction. The husband's reaction is also problematic. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
