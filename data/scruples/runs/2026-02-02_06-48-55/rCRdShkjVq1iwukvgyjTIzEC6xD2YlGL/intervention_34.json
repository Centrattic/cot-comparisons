I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their husband they haven't had an orgasm in six months. So, first, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe woman is married, 24, husband is 25. She hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is about six months. She was feeling frustrated and asked him when he last had one. He reacted negatively, called it a loaded question, got angry, and she apologized. Now he's slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm, so the main issue here is communication in a marriage about sexual satisfaction. The woman raised a concern, which is valid. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question, which her husband pointed out. The term \"loaded question\" usually implies a question that's designed to trap someone or make them look bad. So asking \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" in the context of her not having one might be seen as implying something about his performance, even if that's not her intent. \n\nHer husband took it as an attack, which suggests that maybe the way she framed the question wasn't the best approach. But is she in the wrong for wanting to express her frustration? Probably not. It's important to communicate needs in a relationship. However, the method could be improved. Instead of leading with a question that compares their experiences, maybe a more direct and less confrontational way to express her feelings would have been better. \n\nShe apologized, which indicates she realized the approach might have been harsh. The husband's reaction is also concerning\u2014getting angry while driving, shouting, slamming doors, and giving insincere apologies. That's red flag behavior. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe act of bringing up the issue isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be the tone or the way she approached it. If they had an open conversation, that could help. But since the husband reacted defensively, maybe she should have been more gentle. However, it's hard to say if that's the case because people react differently. \n\nIn most cases, the expectation is that partners should communicate openly about their needs and concerns. So the woman isn't wrong for trying to address the issue. The husband's response is more problematic. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong. She had a legitimate concern and tried to address it, even if the method could be improved. The husband's defensiveness and angry reaction are the bigger issues here.\n"
