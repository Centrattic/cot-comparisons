I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple where the woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Expressing dissatisfaction in the bedroom is a valid concern. The woman's frustration is real, and she's trying to address it. But how she approached it might be the issue. She asked about his last orgasm, which could be seen as a loaded or accusatory question. Her husband's reaction is defensive and angry, which is problematic too.\n\nHowever, the key here is whether she was wrong to express her feelings. In healthy relationships, discussing intimacy issues is important. The husband's response\u2014getting angry, shouting, and slamming doors\u2014is not helpful. The question is if the woman's initial statement was wrong. She wasn't attacking him directly but sharing her experience. The way she approached it might not have been ideal, but the fact that she brought it up is not inherently wrong. The husband's reaction is more indicative of the problem here. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
