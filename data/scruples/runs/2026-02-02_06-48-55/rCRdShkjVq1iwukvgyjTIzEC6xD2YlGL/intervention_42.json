I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronted her husband about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is sharing her frustration about their sex life. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively. She says she apologized but he got angry. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nThe wife's action was to communicate her feelings and bring up a problem they're facing. It's important in relationships to discuss such issues, so maybe she's trying to address a problem. However, the way she approached it might have been poor. She called it a \"loaded question,\" which could imply she was setting him up for a negative reaction. His response was anger and defensiveness, which isn't ideal either. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling attacked rather than addressing the issue. He lashed out, which isn't healthy communication. On the other hand, the wife's question might have been a trigger for him, especially if he feels responsible or inadequate. \n\nIs she in the wrong for bringing it up? Maybe not, because communication is key. But the way she phrased the question might have been confrontational. However, the husband's reaction was extreme and unhelpful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both could have handled it better. But the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. She did apologize, so maybe she's trying to resolve the issue. The husband's actions (slamming doors, blowing up the phone) are inappropriate. \n\nThe user thinks she's in the wrong, but I think she's trying to address a valid concern. The husband's reaction is the bigger issue here. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
