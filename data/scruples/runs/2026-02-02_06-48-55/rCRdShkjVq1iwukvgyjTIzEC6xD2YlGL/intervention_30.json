I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had orgasms in six months. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe woman is married, 24, her husband is 25. She hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is about six months. She's frustrated and asked him when he last had one. He reacted negatively, got angry, and now they're in a conflict. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are communication in a relationship and the appropriateness of the approach. The woman is bringing up a problem she's having\u2014lack of sexual satisfaction. She's asked her husband about his last orgasm, which he found loaded. He responded with anger and defensiveness.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, expressing dissatisfaction in a relationship is generally a valid thing to do. However, the way she approached it might be an issue. She asked a question that could be seen as accusatory or leading. Maybe the timing, like during driving, was not ideal. Also, the example of the question is \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which might sound more like a passive-aggressive way to imply that he's not fulfilling her needs. If she had approached it with more openness, like expressing her feelings and needs without comparing, perhaps it would have gone better.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction seems overly defensive. He didn't engage in a healthy discussion but instead became angry and hostile. That's not a good response. But the question is about the author's actions. If she was honest but used a confrontational approach, maybe she's partially at fault. However, the core issue is her lack of satisfaction, which is a legitimate concern. The problem might be more about how she communicated it rather than the act of communicating it.\n\nSo, if she had said, \"I haven't been able to reach orgasm in a while, and I want us to work on this together,\" that's different. But by asking him about his last one, she might have made him feel attacked. Therefore, maybe the author's approach was not ideal, making her at least partially in the wrong. But is she entirely in the wrong? Probably not. There's a balance here. The husband's reaction is also problematic, but the question is about her.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (Yes, in the wrong) because her method of communication might have been the issue, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, B (Not in the wrong) because bringing up a legitimate issue is okay, even if the method needs improvement. The user thinks A, but maybe the correct answer is B. Let me think again. The key here is whether the act of telling him is in the wrong. If she is honest about her feelings and needs, even if the timing or phrasing is off, she's not inherently wrong for sharing her experience. The problem is more on the husband's response. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; she's advocating for her needs, which is valid. So the answer would be B.\n"
