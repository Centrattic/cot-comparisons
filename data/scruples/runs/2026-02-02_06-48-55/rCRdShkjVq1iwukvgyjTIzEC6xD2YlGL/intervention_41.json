I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to tell her husband after feeling frustrated. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is sharing her feelings, which are important and valid. Communication about sexual satisfaction in a marriage is crucial. However, the way she brought it up might have been a problem. She asked a loaded question out of frustration, which he recognized. His reaction was anger and defensiveness, which isn't ideal either. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe the issue is more about how they communicated. The wife's intention was to be honest about her feelings, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling attacked, which could be due to his own insecurities or stress. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the key question is whether the wife was wrong to express her lack of orgasms. Since open communication is important, she's not in the wrong for sharing her feelings. The problem might lie in how she approached the conversation, but the content of her message (sharing her experience) is valid. The husband's response is more concerning because he's reacting with anger instead of empathy. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The wife was honest about her needs, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The husband's reaction is inappropriate, but the act of sharing her feelings isn't wrong.\n"
