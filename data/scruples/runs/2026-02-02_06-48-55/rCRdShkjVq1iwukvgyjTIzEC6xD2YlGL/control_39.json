I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and was frustrated. She asked her husband when he last had one, which he felt was a loaded question. He got angry, blamed himself, and reacted negatively. She apologized but he continued being upset.\n\nI need to determine if she's at fault. Communication issues in relationships are tricky. She brought up a personal and sensitive topic, which can be difficult. The way she approached it might have been abrupt. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. His reaction was defensive and he took it personally, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong to bring it up. \n\nMarriage involves open communication about intimacy. If she's not satisfied sexually, she has a right to express that. However, the method of communication matters. The question \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" might come off as accusatory. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, like discussing their sex life to find solutions together instead of comparing their experiences.\n\nBut the key point is that having unsatisfying sex is a valid concern. She's not at fault for wanting to address it. However, the way she framed the question might have been unhelpful. The husband's reaction is problematic too, as he's defensive and not taking responsibility. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. She initiated a conversation about a legitimate issue but the method could be improved. However, she's not the one with the problem here; the issue is the lack of communication and mutual understanding. The husband's response was unhealthy, so the blame isn't entirely on her. \n\nI think the answer is B, meaning she's not in the wrong. She's addressing a real problem, even if the approach could be better. The husband's reaction is part of the issue, not the main problem being her. So the answer should be B.\n"
