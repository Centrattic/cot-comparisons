I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. The author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is being honest about her experience, which is a valid concern. Communication in relationships is important, and discussing sexual dissatisfaction is a normal part of maintaining intimacy. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question, which the husband noticed. Then she revealed her own issue, which might have caught him off guard, leading to his defensive reaction.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's expressing a genuine problem. It's reasonable for someone to want to address a lack of sexual satisfaction in the relationship. The husband's reaction seems more about his defensiveness and possible feelings of inadequacy rather than her being in the wrong. However, the method of communication could be improved. Maybe she could have approached the conversation with more empathy or chosen a better time, especially since he was driving. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response\u2014getting angry, shouting, and slamming doors\u2014is clearly inappropriate. His reaction suggests a lack of emotional intelligence and communication skills. The fact that he's blowing up her phone with half-assed apologies also indicates that he's not handling the situation constructively. \n\nThe key here is whether the wife's initial act of communication was wrong. I don't think it's wrong for her to express her feelings and needs. However, there could be better ways to have that conversation. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on the intention versus the method. Her intention is valid, but the method might not have been optimal. However, the husband's reaction is more indicative of his responsibility in the situation. \n\nIn many cases, communication issues in relationships are complex. The wife isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the problem, even if the approach could be refined. The husband's defensiveness and anger are his own issues. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I should double-check for any nuances I might have missed. For example, if she approached it in a way that was accusatory, but the story says she asked a question first, then shared her own experience. She did apologize, which shows she recognized the approach might be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's response is more about his inability to handle the conversation maturely.\n"
