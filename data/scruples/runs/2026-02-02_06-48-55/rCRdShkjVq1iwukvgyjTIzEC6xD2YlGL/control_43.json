It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife is 24, husband 25. They're married. She hasn't had an orgasm since October. Today, she asked him when he last had one. He reacted negatively, got angry, accused her of attacking him. She apologized, but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's the issue here? The wife is expressing her frustration about their lack of sexual satisfaction. She asks her husband about his last orgasm, which he takes as an attack. His reaction is anger and defensiveness, but she apologized. Now he's being confrontational.\n\nIs she wrong for bringing up the issue? Well, it's her right to express dissatisfaction in the relationship. Communication is key in relationships, so bringing up such a sensitive topic can be difficult. However, the way she approached it might be part of the problem. She asked a loaded question about his last orgasm, which he found accusatory. Maybe she could have approached it differently, focusing on her feelings rather than his, like \"I haven't been able to reach orgasm lately; how can we work on this together?\" Instead, she asked about his, which might have made him feel attacked.\n\nBut the husband's reaction seems extreme. Getting angry, slamming doors, and not being receptive to her apology suggests he's not handling the situation well. However, the wife initiated the conversation, so maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps there's a balance here.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether her actions were justified. She's seeking help or change in their sexual relationship, which is a valid concern. The problem is how she communicated it. If she had approached it more collaboratively, maybe the reaction would be different. But since she's trying to address a problem, she might not be the asshole here. The husband's response is also problematic. He's defensive and not engaging constructively.\n\nBut the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. If she's trying to bring up a legitimate issue, even if the method could be improved, she's not necessarily wrong. However, maybe the way she framed the question (\"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\") was confrontational. Maybe she should have focused on her own experience first before bringing up his. \n\nIn the end, the user is looking for validation. The husband's reaction is clearly problematic, but the wife's approach could be tweaked. However, the fact that she's trying to address the issue is not wrong. So the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The husband is also not handling it well, but the question is about her. Since she's the one who initiated the conversation to address a problem, she's not the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
