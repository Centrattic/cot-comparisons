I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The author's husband reacted negatively, getting angry and upset, saying she attacks him and that nothing he does is good enough.\n\nFirst, the author's action was to communicate her feelings and a problem in their sex life. She directly asked about his orgasm, which might have been a sensitive topic. However, she then shared her own experience, which could be seen as sharing her vulnerability. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling criticized or attacked rather than the topic itself. His response of feeling awful and shouting suggests he took it personally, possibly because he felt blamed. The author apologized, but he continued to be upset, slamming doors and sending insincere apologies.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Communication is key in relationships, and bringing up issues is important. However, the way she approached it might have been a loaded question, which he pointed out. She started with a question about his orgasm, which could have been misinterpreted. Then she shared her own situation, which might have made him feel defensive.\n\nBut is she at fault? She's expressing her needs and honesty is important. However, the method of communication could have been improved. Maybe approaching the topic with more empathy or choosing a better time could help. But the husband's reaction is also extreme and counterproductive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she's addressing a valid issue. However, the way she communicated could be adjusted. The husband's reaction is more problematic as he's not addressing the issue but instead taking it personally. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
