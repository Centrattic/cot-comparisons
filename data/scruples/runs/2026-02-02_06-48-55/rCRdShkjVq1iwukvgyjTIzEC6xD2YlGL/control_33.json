I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is married, 24, her husband is 25. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and felt frustrated. She asked him when he last had one, which she acknowledges was a loaded question. He reacted negatively, got angry, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So she's trying to address a problem in the relationship\u2014lack of sexual satisfaction. She initiated a conversation about it, which is important. But the way she asked might have been a bit confrontational. She admits it's a loaded question, so maybe she wasn't careful with how she approached it. However, the core issue is her lack of sexual fulfillment, which is a valid concern. \n\nHer husband's reaction seems extreme: getting angry, slamming doors, half-hearted apologies. That behavior is problematic. He's not handling the conversation well, which might indicate he's not open to addressing the issue constructively. \n\nThe key here is whether her approach was wrong. She did bring up a personal and sensitive topic, which can be difficult. But the problem lies in the fact that she's not getting satisfaction, so it's not her fault for bringing it up. The husband's response is more indicative of his inability to handle the conversation, not her for initiating it. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to communicate a real issue. The husband's reaction is the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
