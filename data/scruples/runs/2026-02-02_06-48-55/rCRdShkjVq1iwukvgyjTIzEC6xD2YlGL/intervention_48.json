I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months, and she brought it up to him. She asked when he last had an orgasm, which she admits was a loaded question. He reacted negatively, getting angry and upset, slamming doors, etc. She apologized, but he's still acting out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is expressing a legitimate concern about her sexual satisfaction, which is important in a relationship. She tried to address it by asking him a direct question. However, the way she approached it might have been confrontational. She acknowledges the question was loaded, which could have triggered his defensiveness. \n\nOn the other hand, her husband's reaction seems extreme. Getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and then making half-hearted apologies suggests he's not handling the conversation well. But the author's approach might have been a contributing factor. Maybe she could have approached the topic more gently, focusing on her feelings rather than making a direct comparison or accusation.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she felt frustrated, expressing that without blaming him might have been better. However, withholding such important feelings could also harm the relationship in the long run. It's a tricky balance. The question is whether her approach was inconsiderate. She did apologize, but his reaction was still problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She had a valid reason to bring it up, but the method could have been improved. However, the husband's response was definitely inappropriate. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. Since she expressed her needs, albeit in a loaded way, and he reacted poorly, the fault isn't entirely hers. So B.\n"
