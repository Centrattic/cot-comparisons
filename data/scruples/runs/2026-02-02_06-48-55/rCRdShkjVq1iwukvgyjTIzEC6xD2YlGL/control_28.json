I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about communication in a marriage regarding sexual satisfaction. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and finally tells her husband. He reacts negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is sharing a personal and sensitive issue. It's important in relationships to communicate openly about such matters, especially if there's a problem. The husband's reaction seems defensive and hostile. He's taking it as a personal attack rather than a discussion about their intimacy. But the question is whether the woman is wrong for bringing it up.\n\nShe asked a direct question, maybe in a way that made him feel attacked. However, bringing up a long-standing issue that's affecting both partners isn't inherently the wrong approach. The problem might be how she phrased it or the timing. The husband's response is clearly problematic\u2014he's defensive and not constructive. But the user is asking if the woman is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's generally encouraged to discuss dissatisfaction, even if it's hard. The husband's reaction is more concerning. The woman is seeking validation here, which is common when there's conflict. So, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue, not her bringing up the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
