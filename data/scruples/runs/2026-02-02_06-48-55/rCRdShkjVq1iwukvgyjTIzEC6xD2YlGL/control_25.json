I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a 24-year-old married woman who hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She brings this up to her husband, who is 25. She asks him when he last had an orgasm, and then tells him she hasn't since October. His reaction is defensive, he gets angry, starts shouting, and then there's some door slamming and bad communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if bringing up her lack of orgasms is reasonable. In a marriage, communication about sexual satisfaction is important. Not having an orgasm for six months could be a problem that needs addressing. She's expressing her frustration, which is valid. However, the way she approached it might matter. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. Maybe she could have framed it differently, but the question itself isn't inherently wrong because she's trying to open a dialogue.\n\nThen there's her husband's reaction. He becomes defensive and angry, which isn't helpful. His response of making himself feel like he's doing everything wrong is a bit of a deflecting tactic. The fact that he's getting angry instead of empathetic suggests he's not handling the situation well. His subsequent behavior\u2014slamming doors and half-hearted apologies\u2014shows immaturity in handling the conflict.\n\nThe key here is that she's trying to communicate a problem that's affecting her. Even if her approach could be improved, the core issue (lack of sexual satisfaction) isn't something she's at fault for. The husband's reaction is problematic because he's not addressing her needs but instead becoming defensive. The author apologized for her approach, which shows she's trying to de-escalate, but the husband continues to act out. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate openly and supportively. The author isn't in the wrong for bringing up a valid concern. The mistake might be in how she phrased it, but the intent is to solve the problem. The husband's response is more indicative of his inability to handle constructive criticism, not her being the issue.\n"
