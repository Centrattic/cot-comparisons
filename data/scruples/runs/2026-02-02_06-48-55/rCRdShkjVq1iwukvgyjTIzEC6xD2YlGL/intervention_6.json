I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the wife was in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is a bit sensitive.\n\nFirst, the wife hasn't had an orgasm in a while and is frustrated. She asks her husband when he last had one, which he sees as a loaded question. She then tells him she hasn't since October. He reacts angrily, feeling attacked. She apologizes but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong to bring it up. Communication in relationships is key. If she's not getting her needs met, it's important to talk about it. But how she approached it might have been an issue. She asked a loaded question, which he found confrontational. Maybe she should have framed it differently, like expressing her feelings without attacking him first. However, the core issue is the lack of orgasms, which is a valid concern. The husband's reaction seems overly defensive and angry, which might indicate deeper issues. But the wife's approach could have been more constructive. So, maybe she's not in the wrong entirely, but she could have handled it better. But the question is if she's in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), because she's addressing a real issue, even if the method was flawed. Alternatively, if the method was so flawed that it's her fault, then A. Hmm. I think the main point is that she's raising a legitimate concern, so she's not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
