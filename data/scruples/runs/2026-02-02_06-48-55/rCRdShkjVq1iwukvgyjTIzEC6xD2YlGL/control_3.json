I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. First, I need to understand the context. The woman is married, 24, and her husband is 25. She hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. She asked him when the last time he had one, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. She apologized but he's still acting out.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication in a relationship. The question is whether she was wrong to bring up her lack of orgasms. Let me think about typical relationship advice. Open communication is usually encouraged. If there's a problem with intimacy, it's important to discuss it. However, the way she approached it might be a factor. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. Maybe she didn't frame it in a way that invites collaboration. Instead of directly stating her frustration, perhaps she could have approached it more gently. But then again, she's frustrated and it's been six months. \n\nHusbands may not always be aware of their partner's needs, so bringing it up is necessary. However, his reaction seems to be deflection and anger. He didn't seem to take her feelings seriously. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. She expressed her feelings, which is valid. The problem might be in the method. Did she have the right to express her feelings or is that attacking him? The husband's response suggests he felt attacked, but that's his reaction. The author's intent was to communicate her dissatisfaction, which is her right. \n\nIn many cases, the person who is hurt is not the asshole. If the husband is not addressing the issue constructively and reacting with anger, that's more on him. The author tried to talk about it, which is the right step. Even if the approach could have been better, she's not the one at fault here. So the answer would be B, she's not the asshole.\n"
