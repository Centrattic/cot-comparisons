I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing orgasms. The wife hasn't had one in six months and asked her husband when he last had one. The husband reacted angrily, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is expressing frustration about her sex life, which is a valid concern. Communication in relationships is key, especially regarding intimacy. But how she approached the question might matter. She asked during a time when they were having sex, and maybe the way she phrased it as a loaded question could have triggered him. However, bringing up personal issues isn't inherently wrong. The husband's reaction seems excessive\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors. That's not healthy. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe the user believes that bringing up such a personal topic in a direct way is inappropriate. However, open communication is usually encouraged in relationships. If the husband's anger is due to defensiveness, that's on him. The woman's frustration is real, and not having orgasms can be a significant issue. \n\nThe husband's response seems dismissive and blaming. Instead of addressing her concerns, he's defensive. That points to possible issues in their communication. The woman apologized, but the husband's behavior continued. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings. The husband's reaction is more problematic. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
