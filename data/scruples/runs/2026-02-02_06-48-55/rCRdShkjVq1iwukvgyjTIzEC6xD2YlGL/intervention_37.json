I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who posted this is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is 24, married to a 25-year-old. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and felt frustrated. She asked her husband when he last had one, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. She apologized, but he kept being upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me think. The woman is sharing a personal issue that's affecting her marriage. She's trying to communicate a problem, which is a key part of any relationship. However, the way she approached it might have been a trigger for her husband. She asked a loaded question while he was driving, which could have been a stressful situation. His reaction seems defensive and angry, which isn't ideal. \n\nBut is she in the wrong for bringing up the issue? Open communication is important, especially about intimacy. If she's not having orgasms, it's a valid concern that needs to be addressed. The problem might be in how she framed it. Maybe she could have approached it more gently. However, the husband's reaction is also problematic. He gets defensive, turns it into an attack on himself, and then lashes out. That's not a healthy response. \n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole. The AITA aspect usually looks at both parties. She's trying to communicate a problem, which she's not at fault for. The husband's reaction is his own issue. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe the way she asked (loaded question while driving) could be seen as poor timing. However, the core issue is her lack of sexual satisfaction, which is valid. \n\nIn most cases, initiating difficult conversations can be challenging, but the responsibility isn't on the person bringing up the problem if the other person reacts poorly. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to address a valid issue, and while the approach could be improved, she's not the asshole for communicating her needs.\n"
