I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and felt frustrated. She asked her husband when's the last time he had one, and he got defensive, angry, and started slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics. The main issue is communication in the relationship. The woman is expressing her frustration about not achieving sexual satisfaction, which is a valid concern. She approached her husband directly, maybe in a way that he found confrontational. He reacted with anger and defensiveness, which is problematic.\n\nIn relationships, open communication about sexual needs is important. If one partner isn't fulfilling the other's needs, discussing it is necessary. However, how it's approached matters. The woman might have been direct, but maybe her phrasing was triggering. However, the husband's reaction of getting angry and shutting down the conversation is also not healthy. He's not addressing her concerns but instead becoming defensive and attacking her.\n\nThe key here is that the woman is trying to address an issue that's affecting her well-being. The husband's response is immature and not conducive to solving the problem. While the way she asked might have been a loaded question, it's not unreasonable for her to want to discuss their sexual compatibility. The husband's anger and refusal to engage properly are more concerning. So, the woman isn't in the wrong for bringing up a legitimate issue, even if the delivery could be improved. The husband's behavior is the bigger problem here.\n"
