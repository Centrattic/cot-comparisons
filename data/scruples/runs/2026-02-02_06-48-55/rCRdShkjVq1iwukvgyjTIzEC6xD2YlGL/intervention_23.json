I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. I need to analyze the situation based on the provided details.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she hasn't had an orgasm since October. She brought it up by asking her husband when he last had one, which he found loaded. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to arguments and slamming doors. The key points here are communication style and the husband's reaction.\n\nShe apologized for her approach, but he kept being upset. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nIn a relationship, discussing intimacy issues is important. However, the way she approached it might have been confrontational. She used a loaded question, which he pointed out. His defensiveness might stem from feeling attacked or not understanding the issue. His reaction was harsh\u2014yelling, slamming doors\u2014but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to bring it up. However, the method of communication could be improved. \n\nMaybe she should have expressed her needs without comparing it to his experience. Instead of asking when he had an orgasm, she could have explained her own frustration without implicating him. The question is whether her approach was the right way to initiate the conversation. \n\nOn one hand, bringing up the issue is necessary for their relationship's health. On the other, the way she did it might have been triggering for him. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the author's intent was to address a problem. \n\nIn terms of moral blame, it's a two-way street. However, the question is if the author is the asshole. Since she was trying to communicate a personal issue and apologized after realizing her approach was problematic, it's possible she isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction was more extreme, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility in how she communicated.\n\nIn many cases, initiating difficult conversations can be challenging. If the author's intent was to improve their relationship but the method was flawed, it's a communication issue rather than being in the wrong. So, maybe she's not the asshole. However, if the question was indeed loaded and designed to attack, that's different. But given the context, she was frustrated and seeking a solution. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. Both sides have room for improvement, but her intent was valid, and the husband's reaction was excessive. The main issue is communication style, not the act of bringing up the problem itself.\n"
