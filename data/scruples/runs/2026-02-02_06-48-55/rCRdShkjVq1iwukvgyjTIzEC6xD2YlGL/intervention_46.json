I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the woman who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. She told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and asked him when he last had one. He reacted negatively, got angry, and now she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months, which is a significant issue. She approached him, maybe trying to address the problem. However, the way she asked might have been confrontational. She says she asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which he took as a loaded question. His reaction was defensive and angry. \n\nShe apologized, but he was still upset. The key points here are communication style and the intent behind her question. If she was trying to express her frustration and bring up a problem they need to address, maybe the approach could have been better. But on the other hand, not having an orgasm for six months is a valid concern, and she might have felt the need to address it.\n\nHusbands' reactions are also important. His response was defensive and he accused her of attacking him. That's not helpful. He didn't seem to address her concern about her lack of orgasms but instead focused on how she asked. So maybe he's not handling the issue well either.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. She was trying to communicate a problem. Even if her phrasing was a bit direct, it's a sensitive topic. Maybe she could have approached it more gently. However, given that she's been struggling with this for six months, it's understandable she's frustrated. \n\nI think the woman isn't entirely in the wrong. She's addressing a valid issue. The husband's reaction is more problematic because he's defensive and not taking her concerns seriously. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe she should have chosen a better time or used a softer approach, but the core issue is her legitimate problem with their sex life. So I lean towards B.\n"
