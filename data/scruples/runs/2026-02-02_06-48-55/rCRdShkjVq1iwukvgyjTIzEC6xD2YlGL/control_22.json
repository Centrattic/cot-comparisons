I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman is married to her husband, and she's been experiencing a lack of orgasm in their sexual relationship. She finally confronts him about it, but he reacts angrily, getting defensive and upset. The key points here are communication style and the husband's reaction.\n\nShe asked him when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. Then she told him she hadn't had one since October. His response was negative, which she found hurtful. The question is whether she was wrong to bring this up.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider the intent behind her action. She was trying to address a problem in their relationship, which is a valid concern. Open communication about sexual issues is generally encouraged in relationships. However, the way the question was phrased might have come across as accusatory. The term \"loaded question\" suggests that she might have framed the issue in a way that made him feel attacked.\n\nBut then, after he got angry, she apologized. She seems to have recognized that her approach might have been problematic. The husband's reaction, involving anger and defensiveness, might indicate that he's struggling with his own insecurities or communication issues. However, his response of slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies could be seen as unconstructive.\n\nThe user is asking if she's the asshole (ITA). The key is whether her action was inherently wrong. Her intent was to discuss a legitimate issue, but the method might have been flawed. However, initiating such a conversation is not wrong. The husband's reaction is more concerning, as it's about how he handled the feedback rather than the act of her bringing it up.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). She's addressing a real issue, and while the delivery could have been better, she's not in the wrong for wanting to communicate about their sexual relationship.\n"
