I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the woman telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked him when he last had one, and he reacted negatively, becoming angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is in a marriage where she's experiencing dissatisfaction in the sexual aspect. She's been frustrated for a long time and finally brought it up. The husband's reaction was defensive and angry. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are communication and approach. The woman asked a direct question, which might have been a loaded or sensitive topic. The husband's reaction was to feel attacked, which could indicate that he felt blamed or criticized. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Approaching sensitive topics with care is important. However, if one partner is unresponsive and it's causing significant distress, it's also important to express that. The woman might have felt that the way she asked the question was valid, but her husband interpreted it as an attack. \n\nThe husband's response\u2014groaning, getting angry, and defensive\u2014might suggest that he's not handling the communication well. He's dismissing her feelings by focusing on his own defensiveness instead of addressing her concerns. \n\nThe author is seeking validation. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's the case. If the woman's approach was direct but not malicious, and the husband's reaction was disproportionate and unhelpful, maybe the husband is at fault. \n\nHowever, the way she asked the question could have been more constructive. Maybe she could have framed it as a shared problem to work on together rather than a comparison. That might have led to a better conversation. \n\nSo, if the woman's intention was to express her frustration and seek a solution, but her approach was confrontational, it might have contributed to the conflict. However, the husband's response of becoming angry and not addressing the issue is problematic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person acted wrongfully. If she was honest about her feelings but the way she communicated it was part of the issue, maybe she shares some responsibility. But if her husband's reaction was the main issue, then she might not be at fault. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. The husband's reaction was the main problem here. The woman had a legitimate concern and brought it up, even if the method could have been improved. The husband's defensiveness and anger are unhelpful and not a valid response to a partner's honest communication. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
