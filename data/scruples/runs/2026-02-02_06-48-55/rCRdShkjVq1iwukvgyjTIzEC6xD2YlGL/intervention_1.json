I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a 24-year-old woman who hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to tell her husband about it. She asked him when he last had one, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. Now she's asking if she's the asshole for bringing it up.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is important. The author is voicing her concerns about their sexual relationship, which is a legitimate issue. But how she approached it might matter. She says she asked him a loaded question, which he identified immediately. Maybe the way she phrased it made him feel defensive. For example, asking \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" could be perceived as implying that he's not satisfying her, which might come off as an accusation. \n\nHer husband's reaction was emotional\u2014he got angry, started shouting, and made half-hearted apologies. That's not healthy for communication either. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong for bringing it up. If she had a valid concern and tried to discuss it, but the way she did it was confrontational, maybe she could have approached it differently. However, not having an orgasm for six months is a significant problem that she's trying to address, so it's not like she's being unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response was pretty hostile. If he's getting angry and defensive instead of trying to understand her feelings, that's a problem on his part. But the author's approach might have triggered that response. Maybe she should have used \"I\" statements to express her feelings without sounding accusatory. For example, \"I haven't been able to reach an orgasm lately, and I feel frustrated. Let's talk about it\" instead of asking about his last orgasm. \n\nSo, while the husband's reaction was unhelpful, the author's method of bringing up the issue could have been improved. However, the core issue of her lack of orgasms is something she has a right to address. It's possible she's not in the wrong for bringing it up, but could have done it more effectively. The key here is whether her approach was reasonable. Since she did apologize and he overreacted, maybe she's not the one at fault. But there's a nuance here. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether she was in the wrong. If the wrong refers to how she approached the conversation, maybe. But if the wrong is about not communicating about a serious issue, then she's not. The answer depends on the approach versus the issue itself. Given that the husband's response was extreme and she did apologize, and given that communication is a two-way street, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. The fact that she used a loaded question might make her the asshole, but the husband's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the way she asked was confrontational, then maybe she is. But if the issue is the problem itself, then no. The answer hinges on the approach. Since she admitted the question was loaded, maybe she could have worded it better. So perhaps the answer is A, she is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since the husband's response was worse, maybe she's not. I think the key is that bringing up the issue isn't wrong, but the method could have been better. The question is about being in the wrong. If the method was poor, then maybe yes. But if the problem itself is valid, maybe no. The answer might be B, no, because she's addressing a real issue. But the way she did it was poor, so maybe A. Hmm. The user initially thought she's in the wrong (A), but I need to decide based on the situation. Given that the husband overreacted and the author apologized, but the question is about her being in the wrong. I think the answer is B, no, because she's not the asshole for trying to communicate a serious issue, even if the approach wasn't perfect. The husband's reaction is more to blame here.\n"
