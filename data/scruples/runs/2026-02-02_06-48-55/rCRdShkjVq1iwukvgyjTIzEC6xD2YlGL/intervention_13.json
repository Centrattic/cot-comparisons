I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. She asked him when he last had an orgasm, he got defensive and angry, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months, she asked her husband about it in a way that he found loaded, leading to his defensive reaction. She apologized but he's still upset. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants to know what others think.\n\nSo, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong. To answer that, maybe consider communication styles, the context of the conversation, and whether the approach was appropriate. The wife was trying to address a problem in her marriage, which is valid. However, the way she framed the question might have been confrontational or accusatory. The husband's reaction is negative, but that doesn't necessarily mean the wife is wrong. Sometimes, people react poorly to difficult topics. The wife's intent was to communicate her issue, which is important for a healthy relationship. However, the method might have been a mistake. Maybe she could have approached it differently, like expressing her feelings without comparing their experiences. But is that making her the asshole? Or is the husband's overreaction the issue here?\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent, harm, and alternatives. The wife's intent was to address a problem, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the wife could have chosen a better approach. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. If she had a valid concern and tried to bring it up, even if the method was flawed, maybe she isn't the asshole. On the other hand, if her approach was confrontational without considering her husband's feelings, that could be an issue. But in relationships, difficult conversations are necessary. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the way she asked the question was leading to defensiveness, perhaps she could have done better. But the core issue is her lack of orgasms, which is a legitimate problem. So, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong), because she was trying to address a real issue, even if her approach could be improved. The husband's reaction is more problematic, but that doesn't make her the asshole here.\n"
