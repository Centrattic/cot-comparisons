I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author approached the topic directly, which can be tough. She asked about his last orgasm and shared her own experience. Her husband reacted negatively, getting angry and defensive.\n\nNow, the question is if she was wrong. Well, expressing feelings about intimacy is important. If she's not getting satisfaction, it's valid to communicate that. However, the way she approached it might have been a factor. She asked a loaded question, which he recognized. Maybe a more empathetic approach could have helped, like focusing on her feelings rather than making it a comparison.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Not really. She's sharing her experience, which is a legitimate concern. The husband's reaction is problematic\u2014getting defensive and angry instead of discussing solutions. The author apologized, showing she's willing to adjust her approach. The husband's behavior, like slamming doors and half-hearted apologies, is more concerning. So, the main issue lies with the husband's response, not the author bringing up the issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
