I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong (AITA). Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe woman is 24, married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to bring it up. She asked her husband when the last time he had an orgasm was. He reacted negatively, saying it was a loaded question. She told him she hadn't had one since October. He then got angry and defensive, even while driving, which is concerning. He accused her of attacking him and being critical, then slammed doors and sent half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know. So, I need to assess both sides. \n\nFirst, the woman's side: She's trying to address a problem in their sexual relationship. Not having orgasms for six months could indicate dissatisfaction or issues that need addressing. Bringing it up is a valid concern for her well-being and the health of the marriage. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out, and then revealed her own issue. His reaction was negative, but she apologized.\n\nOn her husband's side, getting angry while driving is dangerous and not appropriate. His response of blaming her for attacking him and being defensive could indicate he's not handling the conversation well. However, he might feel criticized, which is a common reaction in such situations. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles and how each person handles the topic. The woman's intention was to address her own lack of satisfaction, which is a legitimate issue. However, the method of bringing it up could have been more constructive. She could have framed it as a mutual problem to solve together rather than as a critique of his performance. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction\u2014getting angry, shouting, and slamming doors\u2014is clearly unhealthy and unproductive. His half-hearted apologies show he's not taking her concerns seriously. His behavior is more concerning and potentially harmful to the relationship.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, both could have communicated better. The woman might have used a more constructive approach, but the husband's response is more damaging. However, the question is whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong. Since she was trying to address her own needs and the husband's reaction is the main issue, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem lies more with how the husband handled the situation. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. \n\nWait, the user thinks she is in the wrong. They might argue that she shouldn't have brought it up in that way. But the woman had a valid reason to express her dissatisfaction. The husband's reaction is more of the problem here. So, I think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong.\n"
