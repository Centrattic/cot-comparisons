I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 24-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. That's a long time and could be a valid concern. She approached her husband by asking when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. Her response was to tell him she hadn't had one since October. He reacted negatively, getting angry and making excuses. \n\nThe key points here are communication and intent. Did she have a right to express her feelings? Yes, she did. But how she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question first, which he took as an attack. Then she revealed her frustration, leading to his defensive reaction.\n\nBut the core issue is her lack of orgasm. That's a legitimate issue in a marriage, and addressing it isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she brought it up might have been poorly timed or phrased, especially if she asked a question that he felt was accusatory. \n\nHe responded with anger and defensiveness, which isn't healthy, but her initial action was to communicate a problem. She apologized and he didn't handle it well. The question is whether she was wrong to bring it up. \n\nI think she's justified in wanting to address the issue. The problem might be more about how the conversation unfolded rather than her being wrong for initiating it. So maybe she's not the asshole here. But I need to be careful not to assume she's right. The answer depends on whether expressing her dissatisfaction is valid versus the approach. Since the issue is real, and she's trying to communicate, she's likely not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
