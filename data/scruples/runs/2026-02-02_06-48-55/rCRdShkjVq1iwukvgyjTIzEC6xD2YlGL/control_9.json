I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is a young married couple. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and finally brings it up to her husband. She asks him when he last had one, and he reacts negatively, getting angry. She apologizes for the way she asked, but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending insincere apologies. The question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Lack of sexual satisfaction is a common issue in relationships. The wife is expressing a problem she has, which is important for a healthy relationship. The way she brought it up might have been abrupt or confrontational. She asked a potentially loaded question, and he took it as an attack. But the core issue is her lack of orgasms, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems over-the-top. Getting angry, shouting, and slamming doors are not healthy ways to handle the conversation. His response of feeling attacked and not being good enough suggests possible defensiveness or insecurity. However, the wife's initial approach could have been more constructive. Instead of asking a loaded question, maybe she could have used \"I\" statements to express her feelings without blaming him.\n\nBut the key here is that the wife is voicing a legitimate marital issue. It's important for partners to communicate their needs. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the wife isn't entirely wrong for bringing it up. The way she communicated might have been a factor, but the underlying issue is significant. So the answer would be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's response is more indicative of the problem here.\n"
