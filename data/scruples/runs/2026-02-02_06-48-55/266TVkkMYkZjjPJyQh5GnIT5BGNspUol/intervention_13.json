My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new short haircut, leading to the boyfriend getting upset and demanding the author punish the daughter. The author refused, leading to the boyfriend leaving them stranded in the cold while pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The daughter was being honest and then apologized, which is a normal part of learning social skills. The author corrected her, and the daughter apologized again. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He wanted the author to cancel the haircut, punish the daughter by taking away her Nintendo, and making her sleep early. The author refused, which led to the boyfriend leaving and not helping them get home, even though the author was pregnant and in pain from walking through snow.\n\nThe main issue here is the boyfriend's behavior. Demanding punishment for a child's honest mistake, especially with a Nintendo 2DS and sleep, is quite harsh. The author tried to handle it calmly, made the daughter apologize, and then refused to go along with the boyfriend's demands. The boyfriend's response\u2014leaving them stranded in the cold, not answering calls, taking his things, and using the author's punishment as a form of retaliation\u2014is concerning. It shows a lack of consideration for the author's health (pregnancy) and well-being, as well as emotional manipulation by framing his own actions as her punishment for not punishing the daughter.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did not do anything wrong. She handled the situation appropriately by teaching the daughter about politeness and apologizing. The boyfriend's overreaction and subsequent actions are the problem. The author's decision to prioritize her daughter's well-being and not comply with an unreasonable punishment is correct. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
