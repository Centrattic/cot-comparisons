My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not punishing their daughter as the boyfriend wanted.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter laughed at the boyfriend's new haircut. The author corrected her, the daughter apologized. The boyfriend was upset, wanted the daughter punished with a Nintendo 2DS confiscation and an early bedtime. The author refused, leading the boyfriend to leave, not answer calls, and abandon their stuff. They had to walk home in harsh weather, and the author is pregnant with health issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the appropriateness of the punishment and the boyfriend's reaction. The author's daughter did apologize, which the author might consider sufficient. The boyfriend's punishment seems harsh, especially taking away a toy and making a child sleep early for a minor social lapse. The author's decision not to comply could be seen as standing by their parenting choice. On the other hand, the boyfriend's anger and leaving them stranded in bad weather, especially with the author's medical condition, is a red flag. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014threatening punishment, leaving them without a ride, and making them walk in dangerous conditions\u2014could be seen as abusive. The author prioritized their child's well-being by not imposing an over-the-top punishment and tried to handle the situation calmly. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and potentially harmful, especially considering the author's health. \n\nThe author didn't do anything wrong by not complying with an unreasonable punishment. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
