My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the setup is that the boyfriend got a very short haircut, and the daughter laughed at him, calling him silly. The author, the mother, told the daughter it wasn't polite and got an apology. But the boyfriend wanted a harsh punishment: take away the Nintendo 2DS, make her go to bed early, and left them to walk home in bad weather, which hurt the pregnant woman. The author refused to punish the daughter and ended up having to walk, leading to the boyfriend leaving and not answering her, then punishing her by taking his stuff and leaving her with the punishment because she didn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is four years old. At that age, children are learning social norms and emotions. The daughter did laugh, but she was corrected and apologized. The mother handled it by teaching her a lesson about politeness and empathy, which seems age-appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Wanting to take away a toy and make a 4-year-old go to bed early for a minor comment is a hefty punishment. Also, making the pregnant mother walk through snow and ice, knowing her medical condition, is pretty inconsiderate and possibly harmful. The boyfriend left the keys and his stuff, implying he was moving out, and then punished her for not obeying his demands. \n\nThe key points here are: the daughter's behavior was a normal reaction from a young child, the mother's response was reasonable, and the boyfriend's demand for punishment is disproportionate. Additionally, the boyfriend's actions of leaving them stranded in harsh weather, especially when he was aware of the pregnancy complications, are questionable. The punishment he threatened (taking away the 2DS and sleep time) doesn't fit the situation, and his behavior of walking out and not helping them get home is selfish and could be seen as abusive, considering the mother's health.\n\nSo, the author (the mother) didn't do anything wrong. She addressed her daughter's behavior and refused an unreasonable request from her boyfriend. The boyfriend's actions were the issue here, not the mother's. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
