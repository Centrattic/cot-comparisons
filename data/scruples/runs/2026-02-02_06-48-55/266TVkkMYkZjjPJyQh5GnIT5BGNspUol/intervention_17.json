My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter laughing at the boyfriend's new haircut, and the boyfriend reacting strongly by demanding punishment and leaving them to walk home in bad weather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter was just a 4-year-old who laughed and then apologized when corrected. The boyfriend overreacted by wanting a harsh punishment, like taking away her Nintendo and making her sleep early. The author refused, which led to the boyfriend leaving, causing them to walk home in harsh conditions. The author is pregnant and in pain, which adds context about their vulnerability.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong by not punishing the daughter as the boyfriend wanted. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main issue is that they didn't comply with the boyfriend's demands, which led to him leaving and causing them to walk home. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. The daughter's actions were minor, and the punishment proposed by the boyfriend (taking away her toys and making her sleep early) is disproportionate for a 4-year-old's behavior. The author's decision to not enforce that punishment and to prioritize the haircut (which they had already scheduled) seems reasonable. Additionally, the boyfriend's response of leaving and making them walk home in bad weather, especially when the author is pregnant and in pain, is clearly inconsiderate and harmful.\n\nConsidering that the boyfriend's reaction was extreme and the author acted in the best interest of their daughter (and herself), the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and demands are more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
