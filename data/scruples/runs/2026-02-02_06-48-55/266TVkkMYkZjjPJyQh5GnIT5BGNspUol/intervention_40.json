My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new short haircut and the subsequent fallout. The boyfriend wanted the daughter punished with a Nintendo 2DS ban and an early bedtime, but the author refused, leading him to leave and not help them walk home in harsh weather.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter made a comment, then apologized. The author addressed the daughter's behavior, and the boyfriend reacted strongly, demanding a punishment the author considered excessive. He then left, making them walk home in snow, which was hard for the author being pregnant. The boyfriend took his stuff and said it was her punishment for not punishing the daughter.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the daughter did apologize, and the author didn't think the punishment was appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He's holding the author responsible for the daughter's actions and punishing her by leaving, which caused the author physical discomfort. The boyfriend's demand for punishment might be seen as overreacting, and the author standing her ground could be justified. The boyfriend's actions\u2014leaving, not helping, taking his stuff\u2014seem like they're escalating the conflict unnecessarily. Also, the author's health as a pregnant woman is a factor; making her walk in harsh weather could be seen as neglectful. The punishment the boyfriend wanted (taking away the 2DS and early bedtime) might not fit the situation, especially since the daughter apologized. The author's refusal to comply with his demands was a reasonable decision. The boyfriend's response of leaving and not helping them walk home, despite knowing her condition, is probably the bigger issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
