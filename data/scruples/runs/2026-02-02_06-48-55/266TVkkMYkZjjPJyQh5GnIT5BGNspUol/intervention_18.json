My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after a situation involving their daughter, boyfriend, and a disagreement over punishment. \n\nFirst, the daughter laughed at the boyfriend's new haircut, which he found offensive. The author told the daughter it's not polite, and she apologized. However, the boyfriend wanted the author to cancel the haircut, take the daughter home, and impose a harsh punishment (taking away her Nintendo). The author refused, leading the boyfriend to leave them stranded in the snow, and later he took his stuff and left the apartment.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they believed the daughter had apologized and that the punishment was too severe. They prioritized getting the haircut done and protecting the daughter from harsh discipline. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving them to walk home in bad weather, especially while the author is pregnant, and then removing his belongings as punishment for her not complying with his demands. That seems like an overreaction and potentially abusive behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's response was disproportionate. The daughter had apologized, and the situation was resolved by the parent. The boyfriend's punishment for the child was harsh, and his actions towards the author (leaving them stranded, taking his stuff) are more concerning. The author didn't do anything wrong by not agreeing to an unreasonable punishment and standing up for their child. The boyfriend's behavior seems controlling and possibly abusive. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
