My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new short haircut, leading to the boyfriend being upset and demanding the author punish the daughter. The author refused, and the boyfriend left, causing a walk home in harsh weather while she's pregnant.\n\nFirst, the daughter's reaction: she laughed and then apologized after being told it's not nice. The author corrected her, and the daughter said sorry. That seems like a reasonable response for a 4-year-old. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He wanted her to cancel the haircut and take away her Nintendo for the day and make her sleep early. The author thought that was too harsh and chose not to comply, which is understandable, especially since the child already apologized.\n\nThe boyfriend then left, causing the author and daughter to walk home in bad weather. The author is pregnant and in pain from that, adding to the severity of the situation. The boyfriend taking his stuff and leaving the apartment unlocked might indicate he's trying to make it difficult for her to stay there.\n\nSo, the author's actions: she didn't punish the daughter as he wanted. Her reasoning was that the daughter apologized and it was too late to cancel the haircut. She also had to deal with the consequences of his absence, which impacted her health. \n\nThe key points here are whether the punishment the boyfriend wanted was appropriate. Taking away a child's toy and making her sleep early for a minor social faux pas is excessive. It's about teaching a lesson, not just punishment. The author's refusal seems right because she's considering the child's well-being and the situation's context. The boyfriend's reaction, on the other hand, was to escalate the situation by leaving and making their walk home dangerous. His demand for her to punish the daughter and his own actions (leaving keys, taking his stuff) show a lack of consideration for the author's and child's safety and well-being, especially with her being pregnant.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing an unreasonable punishment and standing up for her daughter. The boyfriend's actions were more harmful and disproportionate.\n"
