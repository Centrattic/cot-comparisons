My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new short haircut, leading to the boyfriend being upset and demanding a harsh punishment for the daughter. The author, the mother, refused to punish the daughter as he wanted and ended up walking home in bad weather while pregnant, which made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of each party. The daughter did laugh but then apologized when corrected. The boyfriend was upset by this, but is his reaction appropriate? The mother tried to handle it by making the daughter apologize, but he wanted more severe consequences. The boyfriend left them to walk home in harsh conditions, even though the mother is pregnant and has health issues. \n\nThe key points here are about the boyfriend's overreaction and the mother's refusal to comply with his demands. The mother's decision to not punish the daughter seems reasonable because the daughter already apologized. The boyfriend's punishment (taking away the Nintendo and making her sleep early) might be seen as excessive for a simple comment from a 4-year-old. Additionally, leaving them stranded in the cold, especially when she's pregnant and in pain, is pretty harsh. The boyfriend's actions of taking his stuff and leaving the apartment keys also indicate a breakdown in communication and respect in the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the mother is in the wrong for not following his demands. From what's described, it seems like the boyfriend's reaction was more about his own feelings than the daughter's behavior. The mother's priority was her daughter's well-being and her own health. She didn't force the punishment he wanted, which could be seen as her standing up for her child and her own judgment. The boyfriend's actions of abandoning them in bad weather and withholding keys seem more like a personal punishment against the mother for not complying, which is inappropriate.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's behavior is more problematic here. The mother's refusal to punish the daughter as he wanted is not wrong; in fact, it's a responsible parenting decision. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
