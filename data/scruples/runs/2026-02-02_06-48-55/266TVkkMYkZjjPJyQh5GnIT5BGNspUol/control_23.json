My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a daughter laughing at the boyfriend's new short haircut, and the boyfriend wants the author to punish the daughter by taking away her Nintendo 2DS and making her sleep early. The author refuses and the boyfriend leaves, making them walk home in bad weather. The author is pregnant and had medical issues, and now he's gone with his stuff, leaving her with the keys.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter was told to apologize and did so. The boyfriend wanted a harsh punishment, but the author felt it was too much. The boyfriend then left them stranded, which led to a difficult walk home and health issues for the author. The question is about whether the author is wrong for not punishing the daughter as the boyfriend wanted.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about different parenting styles and the boyfriend's reaction. The boyfriend is upset over a comment from a 4-year-old and wants a punishment that the author finds excessive. The author's refusal leads to the boyfriend leaving and making them walk in harsh weather. The author is pregnant and in pain, which adds context about the severity of the situation.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at whether the actions were reasonable. The daughter apologized when asked, so the immediate issue seems resolved. The boyfriend's demand for a harsh punishment, especially for a young child's comment, might be seen as overreacting. The author's decision not to punish the daughter further could be seen as reasonable, especially if the daughter acknowledged her mistake. However, the boyfriend's response of leaving and creating a dangerous situation (walking in melting ice and snow) is problematic, especially given the author's health condition.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's entitlement to expect the author to punish the daughter according to his wishes. The author's autonomy in parenting decisions is a factor here. If the boyfriend is not the parent, he might not have the right to dictate punishments. The author is in a relationship, but when it comes to parenting, the primary responsibility is on the parent, and the boyfriend's insistence might be overstepping.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend taking his stuff and leaving the author stranded is a significant issue. It shows a lack of consideration for the author's well-being and the child's safety. The fact that he used the author's inability to get home as a punishment for her not complying with his demands is manipulative and harmful.\n\nThe author's refusal to punish the daughter could be seen as the right decision, especially since the child already apologized. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and harmful, so the author isn't in the wrong for not giving in to his demands. The main issue here is the boyfriend's behavior, not the author's decision regarding the daughter's punishment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author acted reasonably by allowing the daughter to apologize and not imposing an excessive punishment. The boyfriend's response was extreme and harmful, making him the one at fault in this situation.\n"
