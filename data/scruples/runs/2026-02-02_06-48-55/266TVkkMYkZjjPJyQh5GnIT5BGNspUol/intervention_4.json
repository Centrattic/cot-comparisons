My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and his girlfriend's daughter. The daughter laughed at the boyfriend's new short haircut. The boyfriend wanted the girlfriend to punish the daughter harshly by taking away her Nintendo and making her sleep early. The girlfriend refused and they ended up walking home in bad weather, with her being pregnant and in pain.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend felt publicly embarrassed, especially in front of other people. The daughter did apologize after being told it wasn't polite. The girlfriend thought the punishment was too harsh and didn't want to miss the haircut. The boyfriend left them stranded, refused to answer calls, and took his stuff, which seems extreme.\n\nThe key points here are about the boyfriend's overreaction. The daughter made a comment and then apologized. The punishment suggested by the boyfriend seems excessive, especially given the daughter's age and the context. The boyfriend's actions\u2014leaving them to walk home in bad weather, not answering calls, and taking his belongings\u2014could be seen as punitive and maybe even abusive, especially considering the girlfriend is pregnant and in pain.\n\nThe girlfriend's refusal to comply with the punishment might be justified because the daughter already apologized and the punishment was overly harsh. The boyfriend's response escalated the situation unreasonably. The fact that he left them in a dangerous situation and later justified it as punishment adds to the problem.\n\nSo, the author (the girlfriend) didn't do anything wrong by not punishing the daughter as he wanted. Her decision to prioritize the daughter's well-being and their own safety was reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
