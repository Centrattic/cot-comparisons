My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new haircut. The author, the mother, told her daughter it was impolite, and the daughter apologized. The boyfriend, however, wanted the mother to cancel the haircut and punish the daughter by taking away her Nintendo 2DS and making her go to bed early. The mother refused, leading the boyfriend to leave, not answer calls, causing them to walk home in harsh weather while the author is pregnant and in pain. The boyfriend then left the apartment, took his stuff, and blamed the mother for not punishing the daughter.\n\nThe key points here are: the daughter's comment was a reaction to her father's new look, which he found offensive. The mother handled it by making the daughter apologize, which seems appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction, however, seems extreme. He wanted a severe punishment for a situation where the child already apologized. His actions\u2014leaving them to walk in bad weather, taking his stuff, and making the mother feel punished\u2014seem harsh and controlling, especially considering the mother's physical condition. The mother's refusal to comply with his demands might be seen as standing up for her daughter and not overreacting to a minor incident.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior could be indicative of emotional manipulation or a lack of understanding of appropriate consequences for a young child's actions. The mother prioritized her daughter's well-being and their practical needs (the haircut appointment) over the boyfriend's demands, which is a responsible parenting choice. The boyfriend's punishment of the mother by leaving and not helping during her pregnancy is also problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mother's actions are justifiable. She's protecting her child from excessive punishment and ensuring their basic needs are met. The boyfriend is the one acting unreasonably here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
