My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not punishing their daughter as the boyfriend wanted. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter laughed at the boyfriend's new short haircut. The author told the daughter it wasn't polite, the daughter apologized. The boyfriend was upset, wanted the author to cancel the haircut, take the daughter home, and punish her by taking away her Nintendo and making her sleep early. The author refused, leading the boyfriend to leave them stranded in bad weather, which caused them to walk home in harsh conditions. The author is pregnant and hurt by the walk.\n\nSo, the key points here. The daughter's initial reaction was a giggle and a comment, then an apology. The author handled it by teaching a lesson about politeness. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He wanted an over-the-top punishment for a minor incident, and when the author refused, he retaliated by leaving them in the cold, knowing the author's physical condition. \n\nThe author's responsibility is to discipline their child in a way they see fit. The boyfriend's demands for punishment and then the physical punishment (withholding items and sleep) might be considered too harsh, especially for a young child. Also, the boyfriend's retaliation by leaving them stranded in bad weather is irresponsible and harmful, considering the author's health condition.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author followed through with their decision to not punish the daughter as the boyfriend wanted, and the boyfriend's actions were the cause of the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's overreaction and subsequent behavior are problematic, so the author made the right choice by standing their ground. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
