My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's daughter laughing at the boyfriend's new haircut. The boyfriend was upset and wanted the author to punish the daughter by taking away her Nintendo and making her sleep early. The author refused and he left, causing them to walk home in bad weather. The author is pregnant and had health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter did apologize after being corrected, which shows she was taught right from wrong and took responsibility. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014he wanted a harsh punishment for a minor incident. The author's refusal to comply with his demands could be seen as standing up for her child and not overreacting. Also, the boyfriend left them stranded in bad weather, which could be considered neglectful, especially since the author was pregnant and in pain. The author's decision not to punish the daughter further might be justified as the child already apologized and learned.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's refusal to punish the daughter was wrong. The boyfriend's request for an over-punishment might be unreasonable. The author prioritized her child's well-being and the situation's context (already apologized) over following her partner's harsh demands. The boyfriend's actions of leaving them and causing them to walk in harsh weather could be seen as more problematic than the author's decision.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation by teaching her daughter a lesson without excessive punishment and stood by her decision despite pressure. The boyfriend's behavior was more concerning. So the answer should be B.\n"
