My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter made a comment about her boyfriend's new short haircut, saying he looked silly. The boyfriend was upset and wanted the author to punish the daughter by taking away her Nintendo 2DS and making her go to bed early. The author refused, they had to walk home in bad weather, and the boyfriend left his stuff and the keys, making it harder for them to get home. The author is pregnant and had health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's action. She was four years old. At that age, kids often say things without realizing the impact. The daughter did apologize after being told it's not polite. The boyfriend's reaction seems pretty harsh. Demanding that the daughter be punished with losing her electronics and an early bedtime over a comment from a four-year-old seems excessive. Especially since the daughter already apologized. The boyfriend's anger escalated to the point of leaving and making the author and her daughter walk home in bad weather, which endangered their health, particularly since the author is pregnant with existing medical issues.\n\nThe boyfriend's demands for punishment might be a bit controlling. The author is the parent, so she has the right to decide how to discipline her child. The boyfriend overstepped by dictating the punishment. Also, taking away the keys and leaving the apartment while the author is in a vulnerable state (pregnant, health issues) seems like he's punishing her for standing up for her parenting decisions. The author didn't do anything wrong by not complying with an unreasonable and possibly harmful punishment. The boyfriend's actions (leaving them to walk home, not answering calls) show a lack of responsibility and consideration for their well-being. \n\nSo, the author didn't do anything wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's being overreactive, trying to control the parent's decisions, and putting the family in a dangerous situation. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
