My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter laughed at her boyfriend's new haircut, which he found really offensive. The boyfriend wanted the author to punish the daughter by taking her Nintendo away and making her go to bed early. The author refused, thinking the punishment was too harsh, and then the boyfriend left them to walk home in bad weather, even though the author is pregnant and had medical issues.\n\nFirst, the daughter did apologize after being corrected. The author told her not to laugh and to be polite, which the daughter did. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Wanting a punishment that involves taking away a toy and an early bedtime for a 4-year-old over a comment about a haircut? That sounds a bit too strict, especially since the child already apologized. The boyfriend's anger led him to walk out and abandon them, which is pretty harsh. Also, he knew the author was pregnant and had health issues but still made her walk through snow and ice without a ride, then left his stuff and the keys. That seems like a form of punishment he imposed on the author for not complying, which is probably not okay. The husband's actions caused unnecessary stress and physical discomfort, especially to a pregnant woman. The author didn't do anything wrong by protecting her daughter's well-being and rejecting an unfair punishment. So, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
