My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new short haircut. The boyfriend then demands that the author punish the child by taking away her Nintendo 2DS and making her sleep early. The author refuses, they argue, and he leaves them to walk home in bad weather while pregnant, then later says it's her punishment for not punishing the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is the boyfriend's reaction and the author's decision not to comply with his punishment request. The daughter was upset about her own haircut and saw her father's new look, which she found silly. The author corrected her, and the daughter apologized. The boyfriend, however, was very upset and wanted a harsh punishment. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important to consider age-appropriate discipline. A 4-year-old's comment, even if unkind, is a normal part of development. They might not fully grasp social nuances, and the parent's job is to guide them. The author handled it by explaining why laughing at someone's appearance is not nice, and the daughter apologized. That seems reasonable. The boyfriend's suggested punishment (taking away a toy and an early bedtime) might be too severe for a 4-year-old, especially after an apology. The parent's refusal to punish further is probably right, as over-punishment can be harmful.\n\nThen there's the boyfriend's actions. Leaving them stranded, making them walk in harsh weather while the author is pregnant, and then using that as a punishment is problematic. It's emotional and physical coercion. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive and controlling. The parent made a good decision to prioritize the child's well-being and not escalate the punishment. The fact that the boyfriend knew about the pregnancy and the medical issues adds to the severity of his actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is overreacting, being unreasonable, and using the daughter's comment as a way to exert control. The parent's approach was appropriate, and the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
