My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not punishing her daughter as her boyfriend wanted. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the daughter laughed at the boyfriend's new haircut, then apologized when told it wasn't nice. The author thought the apology was sufficient. The boyfriend wanted to cancel the haircut and punish the daughter by taking away her Nintendo and making her go to bed early. The author refused, leading to the boyfriend leaving them and not helping them walk home, which put the author and daughter in a difficult situation, especially since she's pregnant and in pain.\n\nThe key points here are about the boyfriend's reaction. His punishment seems harsh, especially considering the daughter did apologize. The author's decision to not impose the punishment could be seen as reasonable, as the daughter showed remorse. The boyfriend's response\u2014leaving them stranded, making them walk in harsh weather, and removing his belongings\u2014seems like a disproportionate punishment. The author's health and the daughter's well-being are also factors here. \n\nThe boyfriend's demand for the author to punish the daughter in a specific way might be overstepping, especially since the author is the parent and should have the final say in how her child is disciplined. The boyfriend's actions of leaving and not helping when they needed him could be seen as neglecting his responsibility, especially given the author's medical condition. \n\nFrom an external perspective, the boyfriend's reaction seems excessive and harmful. The author did what she thought was right by allowing the daughter to apologize and not imposing a harsher penalty. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions are the issue, not the author's decision.\n"
