My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the daughter laughed at the boyfriend's new short haircut. The author made the daughter apologize, but the boyfriend wanted a harsher punishment, taking away the Nintendo and an early bedtime. The author refused, and the boyfriend left them stranded, making them walk home in bad weather while the author is pregnant. Now, the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter was upset about the haircut and laughed, but she apologized after being corrected. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He wants to take away the Nintendo and make the child sleep early. The author thinks that's too harsh and refuses. The boyfriend then leaves them in bad weather, causing the author physical discomfort due to her pregnancy. The boyfriend also took his stuff and left the apartment unlocked, which seems like a hostile action.\n\nThe author's actions: they addressed the daughter's behavior, got an apology, and didn't think the punishment the boyfriend wanted was fair. The boyfriend's response is to abandon them, leading to a dangerous situation. The author's refusal to comply with the boyfriend's harsh punishment seems reasonable, especially considering the daughter had already apologized. The boyfriend's actions are more concerning here\u2014leaving a pregnant woman to walk in snow and ice is irresponsible. The punishment he wanted for the child also seems excessive for the situation. The author is protecting their child's well-being and not enforcing an unreasonable punishment. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and harmful, both to the daughter and the author. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; the boyfriend's actions are the main issue here.\n"
