My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's daughter laughed at her boyfriend's new short haircut. The boyfriend was self-conscious about his longer curls and decided to cut them. The daughter made a comment, then apologized when the author explained it's not nice. But the boyfriend was upset and wanted the author to punish the daughter by taking her Nintendo away and making her sleep early. The author refused, leading the boyfriend to leave, making them walk home in bad weather while she's pregnant and in pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 4 years old. At that age, children are still learning social skills and how to express their feelings. Laughing at someone's new look is a common reaction, and the daughter did apologize after being corrected. The author probably handled it appropriately by teaching her empathy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Wanting to punish a 4-year-old for a comment that was followed by an apology might be too harsh. The boyfriend left, making the author and daughter walk home in snow and ice. The author is pregnant and dealing with physical discomfort, which makes the situation even more serious. The boyfriend taking his stuff and not answering calls until she arrived home adds to the stress and irresponsibility.\n\nIs there a cultural or personal context I'm missing? Maybe the boyfriend had a valid reason for being sensitive about his hair, but the punishment he wanted was disproportionate. The author's refusal to comply was reasonable, as she prioritized her daughter's well-being and the practical issue of getting home. The boyfriend's actions of leaving them stranded and using the author's punishment as a retaliation seem selfish and possibly harmful, especially given the pregnancy.\n\nAlso, the author didn't force the punishment, so she's not at fault for not doing what he wanted. The real issue might be the boyfriend's overreaction and lack of support during a difficult time. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation with care for her child and her own circumstances, while the boyfriend's behavior was the problem.\n"
