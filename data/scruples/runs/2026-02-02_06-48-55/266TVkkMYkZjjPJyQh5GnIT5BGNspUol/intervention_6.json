My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new haircut, which leads to the boyfriend being upset and demanding punishment for the daughter. The author, the mother, didn't comply with the boyfriend's demands and ended up walking home in bad weather while pregnant.\n\nFirst, the daughter's reaction. She giggled and said \"You look silly!\" which is a common response for a 4-year-old. The mother corrected her, and the daughter apologized. That seems appropriate. The key here is that the daughter did apologize, so the mother handled it by teaching her not to be rude. \n\nThen the boyfriend's reaction. He wanted the daughter to be punished by taking away her Nintendo and making her sleep early. The mother refused because she thought the child already apologized and didn't want to miss the haircut. The boyfriend left and took his stuff, leaving them to walk home in harsh weather. The mother is pregnant and had medical issues, which makes the situation more concerning. \n\nThe main points to consider: Was the daughter's comment really that bad? For a 4-year-old, it's a typical response. The mother addressed it, and the daughter apologized. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. The punishment he wanted was harsh\u2014taking away a toy and making a young child sleep early. The mother didn't want to punish her daughter excessively, which is reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions of leaving, not responding to calls, and taking his things could be seen as manipulative or using the child's well-being against the mother. The mother prioritized her daughter's well-being and her own health (being pregnant) over the boyfriend's demands. \n\nSo, the mother's actions were in the best interest of her child and herself. The boyfriend's overreaction and the severe punishment he wanted are problematic. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
