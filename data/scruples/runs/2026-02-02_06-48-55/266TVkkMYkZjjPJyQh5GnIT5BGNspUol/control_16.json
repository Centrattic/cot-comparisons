My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new haircut, and the boyfriend wants the author to punish the daughter. The author didn't agree, leading to the boyfriend leaving them stranded.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter made a comment, apologized, and then the boyfriend wanted a harsh punishment. The author refused, and the boyfriend left, causing them to walk home in bad weather while the author is pregnant. That seems harsh. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for not giving the punishment? The daughter did apologize, so maybe the punishment was excessive. The boyfriend's reaction seems over the top. He left them in bad weather, knowing the author was pregnant with health issues. That's a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend felt disrespected. But the daughter's apology was sincere. The author's main point is that she didn't want to punish the child for a minor incident, especially after an apology. The boyfriend's punishment (taking away the Nintendo and sleep early) seems too harsh for a 4-year-old's comment, especially after an apology.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions of leaving them stranded and taking his stuff seems like a bigger issue. The author is protecting her daughter's well-being, which is a parent's role. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own bruised ego, perhaps, rather than the daughter's behavior. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She stood her ground when the boyfriend's demands were unreasonable. The boyfriend's actions (leaving them to walk in bad weather, taking his things) are more problematic. The punishment he wanted was excessive, and the author prioritized her daughter's needs and her own health. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The key points here are about reasonable punishment, the boyfriend's overreaction, and the health implications for the author during pregnancy.\n"
