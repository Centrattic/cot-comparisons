My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong after not punishing her daughter as her boyfriend wanted.\n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter laughed at the boyfriend's new short haircut, which he was self-conscious about. The author told the daughter that it wasn't polite to laugh at people, and the daughter apologized. Then the boyfriend got really upset, wanted the author to punish her daughter by taking away her Nintendo and making her go to bed early. The author refused, and the boyfriend left, causing them to walk home in harsh weather while she's pregnant and in pain. The boyfriend also took his stuff and left, making her apartment keys inaccessible until they got home.\n\nSo, the main points here are: did the author do something wrong by not punishing her daughter? \n\nThe daughter did apologize after being told it wasn't polite. The author's reasoning for not punishing her might be that the apology was sufficient, or that the punishment seemed too harsh. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving them stranded in bad weather when the author is pregnant. Also, the punishment (taking away the Nintendo and an early bedtime) might be considered over-the-top for a 4-year-old's comment, especially when the child did apologize. \n\nThe boyfriend's response also includes taking his things and leaving the apartment, which is a significant action. The author had to deal with the consequences of his anger, which included walking in snow and dealing with her own physical discomfort. \n\nConsidering typical parenting approaches, a 4-year-old's comment, even if unkind, is part of learning social skills. The author corrected the behavior, the child apologized, so the immediate issue was addressed. The boyfriend's demand for a harsh punishment might not be the best approach, especially if it's inconsistent with how the author usually handles discipline. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend left them in a bad situation, knowing she's pregnant and in pain. His response of making her walk home in the snow as \"punishment\" for not complying with his demands is likely the more problematic part here. \n\nSo, the author's decision not to punish the daughter further might be justified because the immediate correction was made, and the boyfriend's reaction was extreme and harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
