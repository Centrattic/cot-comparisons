My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a daughter laughing at her boyfriend's new haircut, and the boyfriend wants the author to punish the daughter harshly. The author refused, leading to the boyfriend leaving them to walk home in bad weather while she's pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter giggled and made a comment, then apologized when corrected. The boyfriend was upset about the comment and wanted the author to cancel the haircut and take away the daughter's Nintendo for the day. The author didn't comply, so he left, causing them to walk home in harsh conditions. The author is pregnant and experienced pain from the walk.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not punishing the daughter as the boyfriend wanted. Let's consider the elements of responsibility here. The daughter was four years old. At that age, children often make comments without malice and can be corrected with explanations. The mother addressed the comment by explaining politeness and the daughter apologized. That seems appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially wanting to take away the Nintendo and make the child sleep early. Those are more severe punishments and might not be suitable for a four-year-old's innocent comment. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response of leaving them stranded in bad weather, knowing the author is pregnant and in pain, is a serious issue. His punishment for the mother not complying with his demands was to make her walk in harsh conditions, which could endanger her health. This seems like an act of control or retaliation rather than a reasonable response to the situation. \n\nThe author's refusal to follow his demands was in the best interest of her daughter and herself. It's reasonable to prioritize the child's well-being and avoid unnecessary punishment for a minor incident. The boyfriend's actions, including removing his belongings and leaving them in a difficult situation, indicate a lack of consideration for the mother's health and the child's welfare. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend's overreaction and the author's refusal to comply don't make her the asshole. The boyfriend's actions were more harmful and inappropriate. The author acted in line with child-rearing practices that emphasize teaching kindness and not over-punishing small mistakes, especially for a young child. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
