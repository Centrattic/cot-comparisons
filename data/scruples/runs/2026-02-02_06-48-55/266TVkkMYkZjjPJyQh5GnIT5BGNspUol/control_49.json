My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter made a comment about her boyfriend's new haircut, called him silly, and then apologized. The boyfriend was really upset and wanted the author to cancel the haircut, punish the daughter by taking away her Nintendo and making her sleep early. The author refused, thinking the daughter already apologized, and then the boyfriend left them stranded in the cold, wouldn't answer calls, and took his stuff, leaving them without keys. The author is pregnant and had medical issues, so walking in the snow was painful.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The daughter was young, 4 years old. She laughed at the boyfriend's haircut, which is a common reaction for a child. The author told her not to be rude, and the daughter apologized. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Wanting to cancel the haircut and punish the child for a small incident, especially when the child had already apologized, might be too harsh. The boyfriend then left them stranded in harsh weather, which is dangerous, especially since the author is pregnant and has health issues. The boyfriend also took his things and left the keys, which complicates the situation further.\n\nThe author's decision not to punish the daughter further seems reasonable. The daughter was young, and the comment was made in a moment of childishness. The boyfriend's punishment of taking away the Nintendo and making her sleep early might be considered excessive, especially since the child showed remorse. The boyfriend's reaction to leaving them in the cold and cutting off communication is irresponsible and harmful, particularly given the author's medical condition. The boyfriend's actions put both the author and the daughter in a difficult physical situation, which is inconsiderate and possibly dangerous.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's overreaction to the daughter's comment and his subsequent actions. The author's refusal to comply with an unreasonable punishment request is not wrong. The boyfriend's behavior in leaving them stranded and not responding is the main issue here. The author's priority was to get the daughter's haircut done as planned, given the time they had already waited, which is understandable. The author's decision to stand her ground when the boyfriend's demands were unreasonable shows that she's protecting her child's interests and their well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here. The answer should be B.\n"
