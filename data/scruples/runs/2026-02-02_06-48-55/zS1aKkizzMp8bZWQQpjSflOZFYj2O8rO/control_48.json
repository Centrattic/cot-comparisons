      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. She leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, etc. She mentions it shouldn't take an hour and even sets up his coffee. The husband can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish all tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working while the husband is at home. She's setting expectations through a to-do list, which seems reasonable. The tasks listed are minimal and basic. The husband's refusal to do them and his snippiness when not all are done could indicate a lack of cooperation or communication issues.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to expect one partner to clean while the other is working? That depends on their agreement. If they had a prior arrangement or if this is a mutual expectation, then maybe. But the author mentions she doesn't expect much, which might suggest she's trying to be fair. However, the husband's reaction might be part of the problem. If he's not contributing, that's his issue. But if the author hasn't discussed this openly with him, maybe she's assuming too much.\n\nAlso, the part where she says she doesn't \"hit her knees to praise him\" when he does 3/4 of the tasks. That phrasing might imply she's critical or not appreciative, which could be a point against her. But if the tasks are part of a shared responsibility, then expecting completion is reasonable. The husband's attitude is definitely a red flag\u2014being snippy instead of discussing the issue.\n\nSo, the question is about shared responsibilities in a marriage. The author is trying to maintain a clean home while working, and the husband isn't pulling his weight. The tasks are simple and take an hour. The husband's refusal and negative reactions are problematic. The author isn't necessarily wrong for setting expectations, but maybe she needs to communicate better. However, the husband's behavior is definitely part of the problem. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's expectations are reasonable, and the husband isn't meeting them. The key is whether the expectations were mutual. If the author set these expectations without discussing, maybe she's partially at fault. But since the tasks are basic and the husband refuses, the main issue is his lack of cooperation. So probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
