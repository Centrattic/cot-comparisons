I don\u2019t ask him to do anything particularly gross or meticulous and even set up his coffee pot for when he wakes up. \nIt\u2019s not a lot and should take less than an hour to accomplish. \nHe can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it and gets snippy when I don\u2019t hit my knees to praise him for only doing 3/4s. \nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for opinions on whether they're the asshole for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're both working. The author mentions they leave a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. They set up the coffee pot as a helpful gesture, but the husband doesn't do the cleaning and gets snippy when only part is done.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both partners are working, so they might have shared responsibilities. The author is setting expectations, which is reasonable. But maybe the husband isn't pulling his weight, or there's a communication issue. The author isn't asking for much, just basic tasks. The husband's reaction seems negative, maybe defensive. \n\nWait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but others might disagree. The key points: the author doesn't expect much, provides a list, and the husband doesn't do it. The husband's snippiness when only part done could indicate resentment or not being on the same page. \n\nIs it the author's fault for expecting help? Maybe not. They're sharing the workload as they see fit. The husband's refusal to do his part without complaint might make him the asshole. The author setting up the coffee pot is a nice touch, showing they're trying to be considerate. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
