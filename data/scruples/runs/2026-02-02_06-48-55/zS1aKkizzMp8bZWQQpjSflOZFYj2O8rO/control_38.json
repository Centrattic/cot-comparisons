      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The question is whether expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home is unreasonable.\n\nFirst, the author leaves a simple list: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous. She even sets up his coffee pot. She says it should take less than an hour. But he can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with 3/4 done.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are expectations of shared household responsibilities. In many relationships, chores are split, but there's no one-size-fits-all. The author is asking if she's at fault for expecting her husband to handle these tasks while she's away. \n\nI think part of the problem might be communication. Maybe they haven't discussed how chores are divided. The husband might feel he's doing other things or that the cleaning isn't a priority. The fact that he gets snippy when she's not happy could indicate a lack of mutual respect or understanding. \n\nAlso, the author is doing her part by setting up the coffee pot, which is a nice touch, but the husband's response might be dismissive. The author isn't asking for a lot, so maybe her expectations are reasonable. However, it's possible that the husband has different views on domestic responsibilities, or maybe he's not as motivated because others are handling it. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's setting clear, simple tasks and the husband is refusing, maybe the problem is more on his side. However, if the author is not considering his perspective or workload, that could be an issue. But since she's at work and he's at home, he has the time to do these chores, which are not excessive. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's setting reasonable expectations and contributing by setting up the coffee. The husband's unwillingness and snippiness are problematic. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
