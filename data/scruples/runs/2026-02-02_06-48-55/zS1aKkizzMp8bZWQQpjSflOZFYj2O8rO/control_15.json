      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. They mention it shouldn't take long, less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage. Both partners usually contribute to household chores unless otherwise agreed. The author is setting up some tasks, which are reasonable and not overly demanding. The husband not doing them and getting annoyed suggests a problem in communication or fairness. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't considering the husband's responsibilities. Is there an agreement about chores? If the author is working and the husband is at home, maybe he's supposed to handle certain tasks. However, if the husband is also working, then splitting chores makes sense. The key here is whether the husband is contributing equally. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting this. \n\nThe husband's reaction is negative when the tasks aren't completed. Getting snippy implies he's defensive, possibly feeling criticized. The author's request is reasonable, but the husband's inability or unwillingness might stem from other issues\u2014like time management or differing views on chores. \n\nBut is the author wrong? If the husband isn't doing his share, the author has a right to expect some help. However, maybe the author should communicate better or adjust the tasks. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author is asking if they're at fault for expecting help, which is a common expectation in a partnership, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband not contributing and reacting poorly is the issue here.\n"
