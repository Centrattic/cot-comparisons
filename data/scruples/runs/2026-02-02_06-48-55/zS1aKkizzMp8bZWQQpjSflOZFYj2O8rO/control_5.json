      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe author says she leaves a simple list: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, and tidy the living room. She mentions it's not much and takes less than an hour. She also sets up his coffee pot. The husband can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4 of the tasks. The author is asking if she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in relationships regarding household chores. Generally, people have different views on this. Some couples divide chores equally, others might have different arrangements. The key points here are the author's expectations and the husband's response.\n\nThe author is setting up a list that's described as simple and not time-consuming. She's not asking for anything gross or meticulous, which is a key point. She's also doing something for him (setting up coffee), which might imply a mutual exchange. However, the husband isn't meeting her expectations and gets defensive or snippy when she checks the tasks.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on several factors. If the husband has agreed to take on these chores, or if there's an unspoken understanding, then expecting him to do them isn't unreasonable. However, if there's no prior agreement or if the husband isn't comfortable with the division of labor, then the author might be overstepping. \n\nThe husband getting snippy could indicate resentment or a lack of willingness to contribute. In that case, the issue might not be the author's expectations but the husband's lack of cooperation. The author might not be at fault if she's communicated her needs clearly and the husband isn't fulfilling his part. However, if the author hasn't discussed these expectations with her husband beforehand and just assumes he should know, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the imbalance of workload. If the author is working and the husband is at home, maybe the division of chores isn't equal. But in the scenario, the author is at work while the husband is home. Typically, if someone is at home, they might be expected to handle some chores during the day. The tasks listed are basic and not overly demanding.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also important. Getting snippy when the author checks the tasks suggests a possible lack of respect or unwillingness to collaborate. However, the author's approach of checking and pointing out incomplete tasks might come off as nagging, which could contribute to the tension. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author expects the husband to take on these chores without prior discussion or if she's not contributing in other ways, that could be an issue. But based on the information given, she's setting clear expectations and even doing something for him. The husband's failure to meet the expectations and negative response might indicate the problem is on his side.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's expectations seem reasonable. The husband's refusal and attitude might be the main issues. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, if the husband has other responsibilities or if there's a cultural context, but the scenario doesn't mention those. Based solely on the given info, the answer is B.\n"
