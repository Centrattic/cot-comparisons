      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list with basic tasks and even sets up the coffee pot. They feel it's not much and takes less than an hour, but the husband doesn't do it and gets snappy when she's not happy with his partial effort.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, expecting a spouse to handle chores when you're away might be reasonable, especially if it's a shared household. The author provided specific tasks, which is good. But maybe the issue is about communication or expectations. If the husband isn't doing it and is getting defensive, maybe there's an imbalance in responsibilities or unspoken issues. \n\nThe author might be assuming the husband should automatically take on these tasks without discussing it. Maybe the husband feels overwhelmed or there's a lack of appreciation. The author mentions they don't expect much, but even simple tasks can be a point of contention if not approached with mutual understanding. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction is snippiness when she's not happy with 3/4 done. That could indicate frustration on his part, possibly from feeling criticized or overburdened. The author might be in the wrong if they're not considering his perspective or if they're not having an open conversation about the division of labor. \n\nAlternatively, the husband's refusal to do the tasks without some form of gratitude (hit her knees to praise) seems unfair. The author is just asking for basic cleanliness, which is a common expectation in a shared home. The husband's attitude might be the problem here, making the author not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author is setting unrealistic expectations without considering the husband's capacity. If the husband is working and the tasks are supposed to be done while he's at home, perhaps the timing isn't feasible. Or maybe the author isn't acknowledging the husband's contributions elsewhere. \n\nI need to weigh the communication aspect. If the expectations weren't clearly communicated or discussed, that could be an issue. The author left a list, which is a good step, but maybe there's a lack of mutual agreement on responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of fairness, expecting a spouse to maintain a clean home when you're away isn't inherently wrong, but how it's handled matters. The author's approach might be too prescriptive without flexibility. The husband's snippiness suggests there's more to his behavior that could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're setting reasonable expectations and the husband's resistance is the issue. But maybe the author could have approached it differently, like discussing the chores more collaboratively. Still, the core issue seems to be the husband's unwillingness and poor communication, making the author not at fault.\n"
