      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she's not thanking him for doing part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage regarding chores. It's common for couples to have different views on household responsibilities. The author is setting clear tasks, which is reasonable. But maybe the problem is in how the expectations are communicated or how the husband feels about being asked.\n\nThe author mentions she doesn't ask for much and even helps by setting up his coffee. That seems like she's trying to make it easier for him. The husband not doing the tasks and reacting negatively could mean he's resistant to help, or maybe there's a communication issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting help? Well, expecting a spouse to contribute to household chores isn't unreasonable. However, if the husband isn't willing or able to comply, maybe the approach needs adjustment. But the author isn't asking for anything extreme. It's a simple list. If he's not doing it, maybe it's more about his unwillingness than her being wrong.\n\nI should consider cultural norms as well. In many relationships, sharing chores is expected. The author is trying to maintain a clean home, which is a mutual benefit. The husband's reaction seems negative, which might indicate a deeper issue in their communication or respect towards each other's efforts.\n\nAnother angle: the author is working while he's at home. It's fair that he helps out when she's not there. The tasks aren't too demanding. If he's not doing them, maybe he's not taking her needs into account. The fact that he gets snippy when she's not praising him for doing half shows a lack of cooperation and maybe resentment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting help with basic chores. The husband's unwillingness and negative reaction are problematic. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
