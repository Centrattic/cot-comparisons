      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author leaves a simple list with basic tasks that take under an hour. That seems reasonable. Setting up his coffee pot is a nice touch, showing some effort to make it easier for him. The tasks are straightforward and not particularly demanding. \n\nNow, the husband's behavior: he can't or won't do the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he only did part. That seems like a problem. If the tasks are simple, there's no excuse for not doing them. Getting snippy when corrected is definitely on him. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's an imbalance in chores? The author is at work, so maybe the husband isn't doing other things. But the question is specifically about this situation. The author is asking if they're wrong for expecting this. The tasks are minimal, so expecting a partner to do them while the other is working isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe husband's attitude is the issue here. The author isn't wrong for setting clear expectations. If the husband is resistant, maybe there's a deeper issue about sharing household responsibilities, but the question is about the author's right to expect this. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
