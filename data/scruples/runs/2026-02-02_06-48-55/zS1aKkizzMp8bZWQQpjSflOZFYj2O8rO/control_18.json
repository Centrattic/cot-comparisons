      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks, which she says take less than an hour. But the husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable here. Both partners in a marriage often share household responsibilities. The author is setting expectations by leaving a list, which is a good approach to clarity. She's doing something nice by setting up his coffee pot, which shows she's contributing as well. The tasks listed are basic and not excessive. \n\nHowever, the husband isn't meeting these expectations. He might be feeling overwhelmed, maybe doesn't see the tasks as his responsibility, or there could be a communication issue. The author gets upset when he doesn't do them all, which might come off as nagging or not giving him enough credit for trying. \n\nBut the author isn't asking for a lot. The tasks are simple, and she's not expecting him to do more than that. The husband's snippiness suggests he might be defensive or resentful. The key points are whether the expectations are reasonable and if both parties are contributing. Since the author is doing her part (setting up coffee) and the husband isn't meeting his, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. But maybe there's an assumption that he's not sharing the workload fairly. \n\nI think the author's expectations are reasonable, and the husband's refusal to do the tasks without a good reason makes him the one in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But wait, maybe the author is being too demanding? Like, is it fair to expect him to do these tasks every day? If the husband isn't willing to take on that responsibility, maybe they need to discuss it. But the author is clear about the expectations and it's a simple list. So I think the answer is B.\n"
