      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks, like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She says it's not a lot and takes less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it, gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish all tasks, and she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. Both partners should contribute to household chores, but the extent can vary. The author sets up a list and expects her husband to do these tasks while she's away. But maybe the issue is how they communicate or the balance of responsibilities. The husband might feel overburdened if he has other responsibilities. However, the author mentions the tasks are simple and quick. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) suggests possible resentment or feeling unappreciated. The author might be assuming he should do all these without considering his own workload or communication style. Also, setting up his coffee pot is a nice touch, but that alone might not cover the entire cleaning load. The key points here are mutual expectations, communication, and workload balance. If the author isn't also contributing when she's home, that could be an issue. The husband might feel it's unfair if she's not doing her share when she's available. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because she's expecting her husband to handle all these tasks while she's away, without considering his own time or possibly not contributing equally when she's home. But if they have a setup where she works and he's home, maybe the division is different. However, the husband's negative reaction might indicate that the expectations aren't aligned. The answer hinges on whether the expectations are unreasonable or if there's a lack of communication. If the author isn't doing her part when she's home, then yes, she's in the wrong. Otherwise, it's a mutual issue. Since the post doesn't mention her contributions when she's home, it's possible she's not sharing equally. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
