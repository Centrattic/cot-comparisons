      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while they're both at home. She leaves a simple list of tasks, and he doesn't do them all, gets snippy when she's not happy with the result.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The author is working, so she's not at home to handle the chores. Her husband is at home, so it's reasonable to expect him to take on some responsibilities. The tasks listed are basic and not overly demanding. She even sets up his coffee, which shows she's trying to be considerate. \n\nBut then, the husband doesn't do the tasks properly and reacts poorly. The key here is the mutual responsibilities in a relationship. If they live together, sharing chores is typical. The author isn't asking for much, just a few simple tasks. The husband's response\u2014being snippy and not doing them all\u2014might indicate a lack of willingness to contribute equally. \n\nIs the author being too much? Maybe not. She's setting boundaries and expecting cooperation. The problem isn't with her expectations but with the husband's attitude and lack of action. He's not meeting his part of the agreement. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies with the husband not fulfilling his responsibilities and reacting negatively to feedback.\n"
