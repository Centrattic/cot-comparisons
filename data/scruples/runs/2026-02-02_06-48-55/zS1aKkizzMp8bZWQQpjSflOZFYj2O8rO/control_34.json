      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is the wife in this scenario) is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the situation. The wife expects her husband to do a list of simple cleaning tasks, which she leaves for him. The tasks are basic: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. She mentions she doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous and even sets up his coffee. She believes it takes less than an hour. However, the husband isn't doing it and gets snippy when she's not praising him for doing part of it. The wife is upset because he's not meeting her expectations and is defensive about it.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Let's look at common elements in relationships. Shared responsibilities are usually expected in marriages, especially regarding chores. However, the expectations can vary. The wife is clear that her list is simple and manageable. The issue here is the husband's reluctance and the fact that he gets snippy when she's not praising him for partial work. \n\nPossible angles: Is it reasonable for her to expect her husband to take on these chores? If the husband is at home all day while she's at work, it's fair to expect some shared responsibility. But the husband's attitude is problematic. He's not doing the tasks and is defensive when she points it out. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners are expected to contribute to household chores, especially if one is working outside the home. The wife's list seems minimal, and she's even helping by setting up his coffee. The husband's refusal and bad attitude suggest he's avoiding responsibility. \n\nHowever, there's a lack of communication mentioned. The wife might not have discussed these expectations with her husband beforehand. Maybe there's an unspoken agreement or different views on what each person should do. If the husband never agreed to this task list, the wife might be assuming too much. \n\nBut given that she's setting up the coffee and the tasks are simple, it's reasonable for her to expect him to handle basic chores. The husband's snippiness when she's not praising him for partial work is counterproductive and shows a lack of willingness to meet her needs. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is not fulfilling his part of the shared responsibilities and is responding poorly to her expectations. The wife's request is reasonable, and the husband's behavior is the issue here. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
