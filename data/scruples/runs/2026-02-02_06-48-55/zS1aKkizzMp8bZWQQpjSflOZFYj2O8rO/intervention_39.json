      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband and wife where the wife expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She gives him a list of simple tasks that shouldn't take long. The husband doesn't do them all and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish. The wife is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is setting up expectations by leaving a list. She doesn't ask for much, and she even helps by setting up his coffee. The tasks are basic and manageable. She's not asking him to do anything overly time-consuming or difficult. The husband, on the other hand, isn't meeting those expectations and is getting defensive or snippy. \n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual expectations and communication. It's possible that the husband might feel overwhelmed or unappreciated, but the wife is asking for simple things. However, the way she phrases it is important. If she expects him to do this while he's at home and she's away, maybe there's an imbalance in their responsibilities. But she's not making him do it all; she's just setting a list. If he's not completing the tasks and is reactive when she mentions it, that's on him. \n\nBut wait, maybe the wife is also at fault if she's not considering his perspective. Maybe he's busy with work too, or he has different standards. The problem might be that she's assuming he should just do it without considering if he's capable or willing. However, she did set up the list and the coffee, which shows she's trying to make it easier for him. \n\nAnother angle: the husband getting snippy when she points out he didn't finish 3/4 of the tasks. That's a sign of poor communication and lack of cooperation. The wife is just pointing out the incomplete tasks, which is reasonable. If he's resistant to feedback, that's his issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the wife is in the wrong. If she's asking for a reasonable amount of help, which she is, and the husband isn't meeting it, then she's not necessarily at fault. However, maybe she's not being flexible or understanding of his situation. But from the information given, the tasks are simple and not excessive. \n\nI think the main issue here is the husband's reluctance and poor communication. The wife is within her rights to expect basic household chores to be done, especially since she's setting clear expectations. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
