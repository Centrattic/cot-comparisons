      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author leaves a simple cleaning list for her husband. The tasks are basic: sweeping floors, doing dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, tidying the living room. She doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous and even sets up his coffee. She mentions it should take less than an hour. However, her husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4 of the tasks. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is to decide between A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break it down. Expectations in a relationship can vary. The author is setting tasks for her husband while she's away. The tasks are simple, but does the husband have a responsibility to do them? It depends on their agreed-upon roles. If there's no prior agreement, maybe the author is imposing her own expectations. However, she's not asking for much. But then, the husband's response is snippiness when not completing all tasks. Also, the author might be expecting a certain level of cooperation without discussing it. Maybe she should have communicated better or shared the chores more equally.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband isn't contributing, which could be his responsibility. If the author is doing all the work when she's at work, that's a problem. But the author is giving a list, which might come off as dictating tasks rather than collaborating. The husband's reaction might be due to feeling pressured. So, maybe the issue is communication and shared responsibility. The author might be in the wrong if she's not considering their partnership and just assigning tasks. Alternatively, if the husband is not contributing, the author has a right to expect some help.\n\nThe key points are the expectations and communication. If the author hasn't discussed household responsibilities with her husband and just assumes he should do the list, that could be the problem. Also, the husband's snippiness when he doesn't complete all tasks might indicate resentment or lack of willingness. The author's approach might be too directive, leading to conflict instead of cooperation.\n\nIn many relationships, chores are divided based on mutual agreement. If the author is expecting her husband to do these tasks without a prior agreement, she might be overstepping. However, if the husband is uncooperative, the author has a right to feel frustrated. But the way she's approaching it (leaving a list, expecting compliance) might not be the healthiest method. Maybe the author should have discussed and negotiated the chores rather than assigning them unilaterally.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not establishing a mutual understanding and perhaps for being too prescriptive. Her husband's behavior is also problematic, but the question is about the author's responsibility. If she set these expectations without considering his perspective, she shares some blame. Therefore, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong), but it's a bit nuanced. However, given the options, I think the answer is A.\n"
