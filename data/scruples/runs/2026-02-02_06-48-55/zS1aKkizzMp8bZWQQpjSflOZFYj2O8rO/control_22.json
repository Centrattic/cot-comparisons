      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. She leaves a simple to-do list with basic tasks like sweeping floors, doing dishes, making the bed, etc. She mentions that these tasks take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he only did three out of four tasks. She sets up his coffee pot as a helpful gesture.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a reasonable expectation for her husband to do some basic cleaning tasks while she's away. The tasks are simple and time-efficient. She's not asking for anything gross or overly detailed. She's also doing something kind by setting up his coffee. However, the husband isn't meeting these expectations and becomes snippy when confronted. \n\nNow, considering common expectations in relationships. It's typical for couples to share household chores. The author isn't demanding perfection but just basic tidiness. The husband not doing the tasks and getting snippy suggests he might not be taking responsibility, which could be an issue. On the other hand, maybe the author should be more involved in understanding why he's not doing the tasks. Perhaps there's a communication gap or differing views on household responsibilities.\n\nBut the author's request seems reasonable. The tasks are minimal and not excessive. She's also making an effort to support him with the coffee. The husband's refusal and snippiness indicate he's not meeting his part of the agreement. In many relationships, both partners are expected to contribute. If the husband is unwilling to do his share despite clear, simple tasks, that's a problem on his side. \n\nHowever, maybe the author isn't considering the husband's perspective. Maybe he's overwhelmed, or there's an underlying issue. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since she's asking for basic help and the husband isn't fulfilling that without complaint, it's more likely he's the one in the wrong. The author isn't unreasonable here. She's setting clear expectations and trying to make things easier for him. The husband's behavior is the issue, not hers.\n"
