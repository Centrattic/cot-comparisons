      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list with basic tasks and even sets up his coffee. She feels it's not much, taking less than an hour. The husband can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's critical of his incomplete work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a marriage. Housework is often a shared responsibility, but there's no one-size-fits-all. The author is setting specific tasks, which is clear. But is it reasonable? The tasks are basic and not overly demanding. However, the husband's reaction is also a factor. If he's resistant or gets snippy, that's a red flag. \n\nThe author might be assuming her expectations are standard. Maybe she hasn't discussed this with her husband, or he has different views on chores. Communication is key in relationships. If the husband isn't doing the tasks and is defensive, maybe there's an underlying issue. The author might be expecting more than the husband is willing to do, or perhaps there's a lack of mutual understanding.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"hit my knees to praise him\" suggests she's frustrated with his attitude. Maybe she's approaching the situation with criticism, which could be why he's snippy. It's possible both sides have some responsibility here. The author might be in the wrong if she's not considering her husband's perspective or if there's no prior agreement on household duties. Alternatively, if the husband is being dismissive despite clear requests, he could be at fault. \n\nIn many cases, shared responsibilities require negotiation. If the author hasn't discussed this with her husband, she might be setting unrealistic expectations. However, if she's made her expectations clear and he's still not contributing, then he might be in the wrong. The key is whether there's mutual agreement and respect for each other's needs. Since the husband is getting snippy, it points to a possible lack of cooperation from his side. But the author's approach might be too demanding without considering her husband's willingness or capacity. \n\nI think both parties may have some share of the blame, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's expecting the husband to do the tasks without a prior agreement or without considering his input, that could be her issue. However, if they had an agreement and he's not following through, then he's at fault. The post doesn't mention prior discussions, so maybe the author hasn't set clear expectations. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not discussing this with her husband first. But if she's communicated her needs and he's still not cooperating, then it's his problem. The scenario is a bit ambiguous. Based on the information given, I think the author might be in the wrong because she's imposing her expectations without considering her husband's perspective or maybe without establishing a mutual understanding. So Answer A.\n"
