      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She provides a list of simple tasks that take less than an hour, and she's prepared by setting up his coffee. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she's upset he didn't complete all the tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The tasks listed are basic and not overly demanding. The author isn't asking for a deep clean but simple daily chores. She's also made it easier by setting up his coffee, showing she's trying to be helpful. The husband's response\u2014getting snippy\u2014suggests he might be resistant to the request or maybe there's an underlying issue. However, the author is within her rights to expect some level of shared responsibility in household chores, especially if they're married. It's common for couples to divide chores, and the author's approach seems reasonable. \n\nBut then, maybe the husband isn't being cooperative. If the author expects him to do these tasks without discussing or compromising on responsibilities earlier, perhaps there's a miscommunication. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. The key points are the tasks being reasonable and the husband's negative reaction. The author isn't demanding perfection but a basic level of cleanliness. The husband's unwillingness to comply without conflict could indicate he's the one at fault. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
