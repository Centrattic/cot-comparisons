      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The author left a simple list of tasks that take less than an hour, set up the coffee pot, but the husband doesn't do all the tasks and gets snippy when she criticizes him for not completing 3/4s.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working, so she's not at home. She's expecting her husband to handle basic housekeeping tasks. That seems reasonable if they have an agreement. But maybe they don't. If the husband is also busy or has his own responsibilities, maybe the expectations are too high. The list is simple, but the key point is whether both parties have discussed and agreed on the division of chores. \n\nThe author mentions she leaves a list, so that's a good step towards clear communication. However, setting up the coffee pot is a nice gesture, but it doesn't necessarily mean the husband is obligated to do the cleaning. The husband getting snippy might indicate he's stressed or overworked, or maybe he isn't comfortable with the tasks. \n\nBut the author is asking if she's in the wrong. The fact that she's expecting her husband to do these tasks while she's away could be seen as a fair request, especially if they both have jobs and are contributing in different ways. However, it's also about mutual respect. If the husband is not doing the tasks and then gets defensive or snappish when she checks, that's a problem. The author might be overstepping by being critical of 3/4s done, but the husband's reaction is also a red flag.\n\nI think the main issue here is whether there's a mutual understanding about responsibilities. If the author hasn't discussed this with her husband and just expects him to do it, that could be part of the problem. But if they have an agreement and he's not following through, then the husband is in the wrong. The question is, does the author have a prior agreement? The post doesn't specify, but she says she \"leave a simple list,\" which suggests she's communicated her expectations. However, maybe she hasn't considered his workload or preferences. \n\nAlso, the husband's attitude\u2014getting snippy when she doesn't \"hit his knees to praise him\"\u2014sounds like he's defensive and not taking her request seriously. That's disrespectful. So the husband's behavior is definitely a problem. But the author's part? She's asking for basic chores, which is not unreasonable. However, if she's being critical of partial effort without considering possible reasons (he might be overwhelmed, or maybe the tasks are more than he can handle mentally or physically), that's where she might be in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, expectations need to be mutual and discussed. If the author hasn't had that conversation, she might be assuming too much. But if she has, and he's not cooperating, then he's the one at fault. The post says she \"leaves a list,\" which is a form of communication, but perhaps not a discussion. So maybe she's not in the wrong for expecting, but the way she's handling his non-compliance could be an issue. \n\nI think the answer depends on the prior agreement. Since the author hasn't mentioned a prior discussion, maybe she's expecting without setting clear mutual expectations. But the husband's snippiness is definitely a problem. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong for expecting, but she might need to adjust her approach. The key is whether the expectations were mutually agreed upon. Since the post doesn't clarify that, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the husband's reaction is more indicative of being in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but the situation is complex. The main issue is the husband's behavior, not the expectation itself.\n"
