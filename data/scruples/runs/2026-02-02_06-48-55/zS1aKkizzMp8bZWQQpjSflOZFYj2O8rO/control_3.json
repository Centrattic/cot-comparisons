      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of basic tasks that should take less than an hour. He doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author is asking if it's her fault for expecting the husband to help with household chores. The key points here are mutual expectations, communication, and respect. \n\nThe author mentions she doesn't ask for much just a few basic tasks. She even sets up his coffee, which shows she's trying to be considerate. The husband's response is being snippy when she brings up not completing the tasks. That could indicate a lack of communication or differing expectations. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for both partners to share household responsibilities. However, the fairness of the distribution depends on mutual agreement. If the husband is at home and the wife is working, it's reasonable for her to expect him to contribute, especially if the tasks are minimal. \n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014getting snippy\u2014suggests that there might be an issue with how the expectations are communicated or a lack of willingness to contribute. The author isn't asking for a lot, just basic cleaning. The fact that he only does part of it and then bristles when corrected might indicate he's not taking the expectations seriously or there's underlying resentment. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting clear, reasonable expectations. The husband's unwillingness to comply and his negative reaction might point to his responsibility in the situation. The question is about whether the author is at fault, and based on the information given, she's not. The issue seems to stem from the husband not meeting the agreed-upon tasks and reacting poorly, which is more about his behavior than her expectations.\n"
