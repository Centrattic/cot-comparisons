      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. She mentions she leaves a simple list of tasks that shouldn't take long. She doesn't expect anything too gross or meticulous and even sets up his coffee. He can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy about his partial efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a relationship. It's common for partners to have chores, but it's about fairness and communication. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is good. She's not asking for much. The husband's issue might be that he doesn't want to do the chores or feels they're not his responsibility. His reaction of getting snippy suggests there's some resentment or lack of willingness. \n\nThe key points here are the balance of responsibilities. If the husband is at home during the day and the wife is at work, it's reasonable for her to expect some contribution, especially if she's handling other responsibilities. However, the husband might feel overburdened or not involved in the decision-making. Maybe there's an underlying issue about sharing chores or communication breakdown. \n\nThe author's approach is to set a simple list, which is fair. The husband's refusal to meet the expectations and the negative reaction when not fully complied with could indicate a problem. The question is whether expecting a spouse to handle these tasks is unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to discuss and agree on household responsibilities. If the author hasn't communicated her expectations clearly or if there's an imbalance in the work load, that could be a point of contention. However, in this case, she's provided a simple list and isn't asking for much. The husband's resistance might stem from his own unwillingness to participate, not necessarily the author's being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for expecting her husband to do the basic cleaning tasks. The issue seems to lie with the husband's unwillingness to comply and his poor reaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
