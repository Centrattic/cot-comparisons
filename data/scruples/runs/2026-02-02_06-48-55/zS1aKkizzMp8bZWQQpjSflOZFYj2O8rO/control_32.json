      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks, which she says should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish all the tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she's working, and when she comes home, she expects the house to be tidy. She's provided a list, maybe to make it easier for him. She even sets up his coffee, which could be a kind gesture. She's not asking for a lot, just basic cleaning tasks. She's upset that he's not doing them and is getting snippy when she mentions he didn't finish.\n\nThe husband's side: maybe he's busy with his own work, maybe he doesn't see the tasks as his responsibility, or perhaps he's overwhelmed. He might feel that the author is micromanaging or that the tasks are unreasonable. Or maybe he has other priorities. The fact that he gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish 3/4 of the tasks suggests that he might be defensive or annoyed. \n\nNow, the key points here are expectations and communication. The author set up a list, so she's trying to be clear. But maybe the husband isn't on board with sharing the chores. Maybe there's an imbalance in how chores are divided. The author might be expecting the husband to take on more responsibility without discussing it properly. However, she's not asking a lot, just basic things. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. In many relationships, chores are shared, but if the husband isn't contributing, that could be an issue. However, the author might not have discussed this with him or considered his perspective. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) is not ideal, but maybe the author's expectations are not unreasonable. \n\nSo, considering that the author is asking if she's in the wrong, the answer might depend on whether the expectations are fair and if there's mutual agreement on responsibilities. If they haven't discussed this, it's possible the author is making assumptions. But given the tasks are minimal, maybe she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is problematic, but the question is about the author's expectations. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she's asking for basic tasks and has set up a system for the husband to follow. The husband's refusal and snippiness are the main issues here. The author's expectations seem reasonable, so she's not the asshole.\n"
