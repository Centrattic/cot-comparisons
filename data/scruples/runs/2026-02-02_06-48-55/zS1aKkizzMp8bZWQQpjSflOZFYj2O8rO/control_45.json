      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list with tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, etc. She mentions it's not much and takes under an hour. The husband doesn't do it, gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list, and she's upset. The author is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is setting expectations with a list, which is reasonable. She's not asking for anything overly complicated. She even helps him by setting up his coffee. The husband, on the other hand, isn't meeting those expectations and then gets snippy when confronted. That could indicate a problem with him not respecting the agreement or being dismissive.\n\nBut maybe there's more context. The husband might have other responsibilities, or maybe they haven't discussed household duties properly. However, the author is clear that the tasks are simple and quick. If he's not doing them and getting annoyed when reminded, that's probably his issue. The fact that she's at work and he's at home might affect their dynamics, but she's not unreasonable in her expectations.\n\nThe key points are: she's specific, the tasks are minimal, he's not following through, and he's defensive. Typically, in relationships, if one partner sets clear expectations and the other doesn't meet them without a valid reason, the one not meeting the expectations is in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But I should check if there's any imbalance or unspoken agreements that might make her expectations too high. Since the tasks are basic and she's not micromanaging, it seems fair. The husband's response is more indicative of a problem. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
