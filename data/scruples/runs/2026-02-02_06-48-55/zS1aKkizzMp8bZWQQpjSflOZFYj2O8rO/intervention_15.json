      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks, which she says should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author is asking if it's unreasonable to expect her husband to handle household chores while she's away. The key points are the tasks themselves\u2014sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, tidying the living room. These are basic chores. She mentions setting up his coffee pot, which might show she's trying to be helpful. However, expecting someone to do chores solely when the other is at work might be a point of contention. \n\nNow, the husband's response is snippiness when she notices he didn't complete everything. That suggests there's some resentment. If he's not willing to do the chores, maybe there's an underlying issue like lack of communication or differing views on responsibilities. The author might be assuming the husband should do these tasks without discussing the division of labor. Maybe they haven't set clear expectations or shared the workload properly. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. In many relationships, both partners contribute to household chores. If the husband isn't contributing and the wife is doing most of it, that's a problem. But if the wife is expecting her husband to do all the chores while she's at work, maybe she's not sharing the load fairly. The list is simple, but maybe the husband feels it's too much or there's a different understanding.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is understandable. She's setting up a list and even helping with the coffee pot. The husband's response is negative, which might indicate he's not on board with the arrangement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting him to do these tasks. If there's no prior agreement or discussion, maybe the author is assuming without ensuring mutual consent. But in many relationships, some level of shared responsibility is expected. \n\nAlternatively, the husband might not be willing to take on these tasks, which could be a choice. However, the author's approach might be too demanding without considering his feelings or workload. So, there's a balance between reasonable expectations and mutual understanding. The answer could be a bit of both, but since the options are A or B, I need to pick one. \n\nIf the author is setting clear but reasonable expectations and the husband is resistant, maybe the husband is in the wrong. But if the author didn't discuss this with him beforehand, she might be in the wrong for assuming. The key is communication. Since the author left a list and set up the coffee, maybe she's trying, but the husband's snippiness suggests he's unhappy. The question is whether the author's expectations are unreasonable. The tasks are basic, so maybe not. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for not cooperating, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
