      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snappy when she points out he only did part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author is asking if it's unfair to expect her husband to do some basic cleaning while she's at work. The tasks are simple and not time-consuming. She even sets up his coffee, which is a nice gesture. The husband's response is negative, getting snippy when he doesn't complete all tasks.\n\nI should think about common household responsibilities. Many relationships have shared chores. If the author is working and the husband is at home, it's reasonable for her to expect him to handle some tasks. However, maybe the husband has different responsibilities or health issues, but that's not mentioned here. The key point is that the author isn't overstepping with unreasonable demands. The husband's reaction seems dismissive and uncooperative. \n\nBut maybe there's a lack of communication. Did they discuss chore responsibilities? If not, the author might be assuming the husband should know without being asked. However, since she left a list, that's a clear expectation. If the husband is resistant, perhaps there's an underlying issue. But based on the info given, the author's request seems fair. The husband's behavior is the problem rather than the author's expectation. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
