      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their husband to clean the house while he's home and they're at work. The author leaves a simple list with basic tasks that shouldn't take long. The husband doesn't do them and gets snappy when she's not happy about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a marriage. Is it reasonable to expect a spouse to handle household chores? Well, in many relationships, chores are shared responsibilities. But here, the author is working while the husband is at home. That might affect the balance. Maybe the author is assuming the husband has the time, but if he's working from home or not working, maybe he's supposed to manage the house. However, the author leaves a list, which shows she's trying to communicate clearly. The husband's response is getting snippy when she's not praising him for doing 3/4 of the tasks. That seems dismissive. \n\nThe author doesn't ask for much\u2014simple tasks that take under an hour. The husband not doing them and being uncooperative might be the issue. The key points are: communication (the list is clear), the tasks are reasonable, and the husband's reaction is negative. The author isn't asking for everything, just basic cleanliness. The husband's unwillingness to do his part and the attitude when confronted could mean he's the one in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author is not considering the husband's perspective? If he's working or has other responsibilities, maybe the tasks are too much. However, the author says it's simple and takes less than an hour. Also, the husband not doing them and getting snippy suggests he's not meeting the expectations set by the author. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B (No).\n"
