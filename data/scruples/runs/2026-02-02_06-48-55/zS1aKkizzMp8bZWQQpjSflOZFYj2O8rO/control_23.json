      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The husband doesn't do the tasks and gets snippy when she points out he didn't do all the things. She left a simple list with basic chores that should take less than an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage. It's common for couples to share household responsibilities, but the balance can vary. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is reasonable. She's not asking for anything excessive. The husband, on the other hand, isn't meeting those expectations and becomes snippy when confronted. That's where things might be going wrong.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't demanding perfection, just basic tasks. The husband's reaction\u2014getting snippy\u2014suggests maybe he doesn't agree with the division of labor or feels resentful. But is the author wrong for expecting her partner to contribute? Probably not. It's about teamwork in a relationship. If both aren't on the same page, that's where the problem lies. The husband's attitude might be the issue here rather than the author's request. She's setting clear boundaries, which is healthy. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
