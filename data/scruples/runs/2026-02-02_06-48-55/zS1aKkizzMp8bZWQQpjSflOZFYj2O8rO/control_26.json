      "text": "Okay, let's analyze this situation. The user is a wife who asks if she's in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that shouldn't take long. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she's not happy with partial completion.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether her expectations are reasonable. She's asking if it's unfair for her to expect her husband to handle these basic chores. The key points here are mutual responsibility in a marriage and communication. \n\nShe mentions the tasks are simple and take less than an hour. That seems reasonable as a shared responsibility. However, maybe the issue is about unspoken expectations or lack of discussion. If they haven't talked about household duties, maybe she's assuming he should know without being asked. But she does leave a list, so that's explicit. \n\nThe husband not doing the tasks and getting snippy might indicate a bigger issue, like resentment or differing views on chores. But the wife's side is that she's setting clear expectations, which he's not meeting. \n\nIn relationships, sharing household chores is common. If both are working, splitting chores makes sense. The wife isn't asking for much, just basic tidiness. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) suggests possible defensiveness or not valuing her efforts. \n\nBut the user's actions are about expecting her husband to do what's asked. The question is about her being in the wrong. Since the tasks are reasonable and she's communicated them, it's hard to say she's wrong. The husband's behavior is the problem here. However, maybe there's an underlying issue they haven't discussed, like workload or stress. \n\nOverall, the wife isn't in the wrong for having these expectations. The husband isn't fulfilling his part, leading to conflict. So answer B.\n"
