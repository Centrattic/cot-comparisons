      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author provides a simple list of chores and sets up the coffee pot, which seems reasonable. They mention it's not a lot and should take under an hour. The husband isn't doing it and gets snippy when it's not all done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a relationship. Both partners should contribute to household chores unless there's a different arrangement. The author is working, so it's fair to expect their husband to help maintain the home. The list is simple and manageable, so the husband's refusal might indicate a lack of willingness to contribute equally.\n\nThe author's tone is about setting clear expectations, which is normal. The husband's reaction being snippy when only part is done suggests he might not take the tasks seriously. The author isn't asking for more than basic cleanliness, which is reasonable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're asking for a fair share of help and the husband isn't cooperating, maybe the author isn't wrong. But some might argue that expecting a partner to do chores without considering their own capacity or willingness could be an issue. But given the details here, the author's request seems fair. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
