      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting the husband to clean the house while he's at home and the author is at work. The author leaves a simple list of tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, etc. They mention it's not much and set up his coffee pot. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author is working and expects the husband to manage household chores while he's home. But maybe there's an imbalance. How does their arrangement work? Do they have a mutual agreement on chores? The author says they don't expect much, but maybe the husband isn't used to doing household tasks. Or maybe there's a difference in how they perceive responsibility.\n\nThe husband not doing the chores and getting snippy suggests there's some resentment or lack of willingness. The author might be placing an unfair burden on him without considering his willingness or capability. Also, setting up the coffee pot is a nice touch, but it might not compensate for the expectation of him doing chores when he's not working. Maybe the husband is working too, but the user is assuming he's at home. Wait, the question says \"he is at home and I am at work.\" So the husband is at home, which might mean he's not working, or maybe he's on break. If he's not working, perhaps he's supposed to handle the chores. But if they have a different arrangement, like both working, but the husband has days off, that could affect it.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Is the author communicating the expectations clearly? They mention leaving a list, which is helpful, but if the husband is resistant, maybe there's a need for discussion about roles. The fact that he gets snippy when confronted could indicate he's not comfortable with the expectations. The author might be taking it personally, but maybe the husband isn't willing to take on the responsibility, and the author is expecting him to without considering his feelings or circumstances.\n\nI think the key points are mutual expectations and communication. If the author expects the husband to do chores without establishing a clear agreement or mutual understanding, they might be in the wrong. The husband's reaction (snippy) shows he's not happy, so maybe the author hasn't considered his perspective. Alternatively, if the husband is supposed to handle chores when he's home, then it's reasonable. But the problem is the husband isn't doing it and is defensive. The author's approach might be contributing by not discussing it openly, leading to resentment. So, the author might be in the wrong for not having a proper conversation about roles and expectations, leading to the husband's resistance.\n"
