      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not cleaning the house as expected, and the wife feels she's not at fault.\n\nFirst, the author expects her husband to clean while she's at work. She gives a simple list of tasks that take less than an hour. She sets up his coffee, which shows she's trying to be considerate. But he doesn't do them and gets snappy when she points out he only did 3/4. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The wife might be assuming her husband should help with chores, but maybe he has different views on what he should do. If they haven't discussed this or agreed on responsibilities, it could lead to conflict. Also, the husband's reaction being \"snippy\" when she doesn't \"praise\" him is problematic. That suggests he's not taking responsibility and is being defensive or rude.\n\nBut the wife is working, so it's reasonable to expect him to handle some tasks when she's away. The list is simple and not excessive. However, maybe the husband is overwhelmed or has other responsibilities. The question is whether the wife is wrong to expect this. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing chores is common. If the husband isn't contributing, it's a valid concern. However, the wife's tone in the question might come across as demanding. The phrase \"expecting him to have the house cleaned\" could imply she's not flexible. Also, the husband's behavior is uncooperative and unkind, which might mean the wife isn't entirely at fault. But maybe she should have had a conversation first to align expectations instead of just expecting it. \n\nSo, the husband is clearly not helping as he should, but the wife's approach might need adjustment. However, the core issue is the husband's lack of contribution and bad attitude. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
