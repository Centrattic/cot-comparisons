      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting her husband to clean the house when she's at work and he's at home. She leaves a simple list with basic tasks that should take less than an hour. She doesn't set high expectations, but he doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he hasn't done all the tasks. She's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective is that she's setting reasonable expectations. The tasks are simple and not time-consuming. She's even helpful by setting up his coffee. The husband isn't meeting those expectations and gets defensive. On the other hand, the husband might feel that the requests are unreasonable, especially if he's also working or has other responsibilities. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The author expects him to do the cleaning while she's away, but maybe they didn't discuss this properly. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the tasks are simple, she's not asking for much, and the husband is not fulfilling them. It's important to consider mutual expectations in a relationship. If the author expects her husband to handle household chores when she's away, that's a common expectation in many relationships. However, if there's an imbalance in responsibilities or if the husband isn't contributing as expected, that's a problem. The husband's reaction of getting snippy when she points out he didn't do all the tasks could indicate a lack of willingness to share responsibilities. \n\nThe author isn't demanding perfection; the tasks are basic. If the husband can't manage that, maybe there's an issue with his commitment to shared responsibilities. The fact that she's already setting up his coffee shows she's trying to be considerate. However, maybe the husband feels overwhelmed or there's a lack of communication about their roles. But the question is about fault. The author is not being unreasonable here. The husband not doing the tasks and being snippy about it suggests he's not meeting his part of the agreement. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's setting reasonable expectations and the husband isn't fulfilling them. However, there's a need for better communication between them. But according to the question's parameters, the focus is on whether the author is wrong, which she isn't.\n"
