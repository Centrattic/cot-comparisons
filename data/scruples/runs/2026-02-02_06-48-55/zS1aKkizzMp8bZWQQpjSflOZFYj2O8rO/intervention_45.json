      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again. The user is asking if they're the asshole for expecting their husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. The tasks are basic: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, tidy the living room. She leaves a simple list and even sets up his coffee. She says it should take less than an hour. He can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with him doing 3/4 of the tasks.\n\nFirst, I think about expectations in a relationship. It's common for couples to have different views on household responsibilities. The author expects her husband to do these chores while she's away. She's not asking for much, just basic cleaning. But maybe the issue is how she's approaching it. She mentions she leaves a list, which is good, but maybe the way she's enforcing it is causing problems. Also, he gets snippy when she's not satisfied with his effort. So there's a communication issue here.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if she's not considering her husband's perspective. Maybe he has other responsibilities or doesn't see the tasks as a priority. Expecting someone to clean while you're at work could be seen as putting pressure on them, especially if they're not used to it. Also, the fact that he gets snippy when she's not happy might indicate that the dynamic is causing tension. She might be assuming he will do the cleaning without mutual agreement on household duties. If they haven't discussed and agreed on how to divide chores, then she might be making unfair assumptions. \n\nOn the other hand, basic cleaning is a shared responsibility in many relationships. If she's doing the coffee setup and a list, maybe she's already contributing by making it easier for him. But the problem is that he's not following through, which could be his issue. However, the author's approach might be too rigid. Instead of a list and expecting 100% compliance, maybe a more flexible approach with open communication would be better. If the author is using guilt or criticism when he doesn't do everything, that could be her fault.\n\nSo, the key points are: expectations vs. reality, communication style, and mutual agreement on responsibilities. If the author hasn't discussed this with her husband and is now imposing these tasks without considering his input, she might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's refusing without reason, maybe he's the problem. But the question is about the author's responsibility. Since she's expecting him to do these tasks without a prior agreement and reacting negatively when he doesn't, she could be contributing to the conflict. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not setting clear expectations and not being flexible.\n"
