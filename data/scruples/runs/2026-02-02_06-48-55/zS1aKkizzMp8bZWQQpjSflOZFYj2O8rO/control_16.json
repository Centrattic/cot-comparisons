      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. The author lists a simple cleaning list that seems manageable, but the husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he's only done part of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author leaves a simple list, which she thinks takes less than an hour. That seems reasonable. She mentions she doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous, and even helps by setting up his coffee. That seems like she's making an effort to support him, which is good.\n\nOn the husband's side, maybe he's not used to sharing chores, or perhaps he feels it's unfair. But the wife is working, so expecting some help is understandable. The key here is whether the expectations are fair. The tasks listed are basic and not excessive. The husband getting snippy when she checks on his progress might indicate a communication issue or resentment. However, the wife isn't unreasonable in expecting help, especially since she's contributing by setting up his coffee.\n\nAnother angle: in many relationships, splitting chores is common. The wife isn't demanding perfection but just a few basic tasks. The husband's refusal without a valid reason might be the problem. However, if the husband has a different view on responsibilities or if there's a lack of communication about roles, that could be an issue. But the wife's request seems minimal and fair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's expectations don't seem unreasonable. The husband's attitude might be the problem here. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
