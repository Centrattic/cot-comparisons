      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author expects their husband to clean the house while they're at work and he's at home. The author leaves a simple list of tasks, but the husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish. The author is asking if they're the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is working while the husband is at home, so maybe there's an expectation of shared responsibilities. The author isn't asking for much\u2014basic cleaning tasks. It's a list that should take less than an hour. They even set up his coffee, which seems like a considerate gesture.\n\nBut the husband can't or won't do it. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong by expecting him to do these tasks. In many relationships, splitting chores is common. If the author is working while the husband is at home, maybe it's reasonable to expect him to handle the cleaning when he's there. However, communication is key. The author might be making assumptions about his willingness or ability to do the tasks. \n\nThe husband getting snippy when she points out he didn't finish might indicate that there's some resentment or that he doesn't want to do the tasks. Maybe there's an imbalance in their expectations. The author might be assuming that because they left a list, the husband is obligated to do it, but perhaps they didn't discuss it beforehand. \n\nIt's also possible that the husband is overwhelmed or has different priorities. The author's frustration is understandable if they're trying to come home to a clean house after work. But is it the author's fault for expecting a shared responsibility? \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't being unreasonable in expecting basic cleaning, but maybe they didn't consider the husband's perspective or discuss the division of chores. The husband's reaction is also problematic, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn some cases, people might say that the author is not in the wrong because they're setting clear expectations and doing their part by making the coffee. However, if the husband isn't willing to help, maybe the author should have addressed it differently. But the act of expecting the husband to do these tasks isn't inherently wrong. So I might lean towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, maybe there's more to the situation, like if the author is not contributing at all or if the expectations were never discussed. The scenario doesn't mention the author doing chores when they're home, so maybe that's a factor. If the author is working while the husband is home, it's fair to expect him to handle the cleaning then. So overall, the answer might be B.\n"
