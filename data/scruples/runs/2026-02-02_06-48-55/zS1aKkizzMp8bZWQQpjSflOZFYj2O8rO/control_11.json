      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work. She leaves a simple to-do list and feels it's a reasonable request. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she criticizes him for not doing all the tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The wife is working, so she's likely busy. She's not asking for much\u2014basic chores that should take less than an hour. She even sets up his coffee, which is a considerate gesture. The husband's response is negative, getting snippy when she points out he didn't finish. \n\nIn relationships, shared responsibilities are important. It's not inherently wrong to expect a partner to contribute to household chores, especially if both are working. The wife is setting clear expectations with a list, which is a good approach. However, maybe the issue is communication. The husband might feel overwhelmed or not understand the importance of the tasks. Or maybe the wife's expectations are higher than he's willing to commit to.\n\nThe key points here are mutual effort and communication. If both partners are working, it's fair to split chores. The wife's list is simple, so expecting him to do it isn't unreasonable. The husband's reaction is what's problematic\u2014he's not doing the tasks and getting defensive. \n\nHowever, cultural expectations might play a role. In some contexts, men might not be used to doing household chores, but that's changing. The wife isn't asking for a deep clean but basic maintenance. The husband's snippiness suggests a lack of willingness, which isn't fair. \n\nSo, the wife isn't in the wrong for expecting her husband to help with basic chores. The husband's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
