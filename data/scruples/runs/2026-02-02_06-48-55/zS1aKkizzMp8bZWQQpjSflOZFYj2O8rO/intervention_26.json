      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. She says she leaves a simple list with basic tasks, and she even sets up his coffee. She thinks it should take less than an hour. But the husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with his partial completion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable. The tasks mentioned are basic: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. These are common household chores. The author is working, so maybe she expects a trade-off where the husband handles some chores when he's home. But is it fair to expect him to do these tasks just because she's working?\n\nOn one hand, the author is asking for a reasonable amount of help. The list isn't excessive. She even sets up his coffee, which suggests she's trying to make it easier for him. If the husband is at home all day, maybe he should take care of the house in her absence. But maybe the issue is communication. Is she setting clear expectations? The husband might not realize how important these tasks are to her or might not feel it's his responsibility. Also, the husband getting snippy when she's unhappy could indicate a problem in their communication or how they share responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that these tasks are the author's responsibility, especially if there's no prior agreement on sharing chores. Maybe the author didn't discuss this with him beforehand, and now he feels it's being imposed. If he's not willing to do them and gets defensive, that's a problem. However, if the author is expecting him to do these without considering his own workload or preferences, that could be the issue.\n\nAnother angle is the balance of responsibilities in the household. If the author is working and expects the husband to take over during the day, that's a common arrangement. But if the husband is not contributing and the author is now feeling resentful, maybe there's an imbalance. However, if the author is nagging or being critical when he doesn't meet expectations, that could be her fault.\n\nThe key points here might be communication and mutual agreement. If they haven't discussed household responsibilities, the author might be assuming something the husband isn't on board with. Alternatively, if they had an agreement and the husband is not following through, then he's at fault. The author might be in the wrong if she's not considering his perspective or if the expectations were not clearly communicated. Conversely, if the husband is being uncooperative without reason, the author has a valid complaint.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? If she hasn't communicated her expectations clearly, maybe she shares some responsibility. But if she has and the husband is being dismissive, then he's in the wrong. The question is whether the author is overstepping by expecting these chores. Since the tasks are basic and she's working, it's not unreasonable to expect some help. However, the husband's reaction might be her fault if she's being critical instead of collaborative. The answer might be A or B depending on nuances, but given the information, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
