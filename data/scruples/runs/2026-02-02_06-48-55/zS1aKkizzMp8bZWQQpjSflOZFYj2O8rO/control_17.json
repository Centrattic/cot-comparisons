      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person expects their husband to clean the house while they're at work. They leave a simple list with tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, etc., and set up the coffee pot. The husband doesn't do all the tasks and gets snippy when they point out he's only done 3/4. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're working, leaving clear, simple tasks that shouldn't take long. They're not asking for anything gross or complicated. They set up the coffee pot as a gesture. The husband isn't doing it and is getting snippy when confronted. The husband's side isn't given in detail, but he's not doing what's asked and is defensive.\n\nNow, in relationships, expectations can vary. What's reasonable? The author is asking for basic household tasks that are shared responsibility. Maybe they didn't set up a system where tasks are split equally. But the tasks seem simple and not excessive. The husband's reaction is negative when he doesn't meet the expectations. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they might have a right to expect their spouse to contribute to household chores, especially if they're both working. However, communication is key. Maybe the husband doesn't agree with the list or feels it's unfair. The author might not be considering his perspective. They might be assuming he should know what to do without being more specific. Also, the husband's snippiness suggests possible resentment or stress.\n\nBut the author is setting clear tasks and providing a simple list. It's not unreasonable for a married couple to split chores. If the husband is refusing to do his part, that's a problem. However, the author might not be wrong for setting expectations, but maybe they need to communicate better. The husband's reaction is unhelpful, but does that make the author right or wrong?\n\nIn some cultures or relationships, the division of labor is expected to be shared. If the husband is not contributing, the author might be right to expect it. However, if they haven't discussed or agreed on this beforehand, it could be a point of contention. The author might be in the right to expect their spouse to help, but the husband might feel it's unfair or not discussed properly. \n\nThe key here is whether the expectations were communicated and agreed upon. The author leaves a list, which is clear, but maybe the husband has different views on what's fair. Since the husband is snippy when the author points out he didn't finish, that's a negative reaction. The author isn't being unreasonable, but maybe needs to reassess how they're communicating or the balance of responsibilities.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asking for basic help that's part of a shared household. The husband's behavior is more concerning. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
