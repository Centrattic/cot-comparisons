      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband and wife where the wife expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. The wife leaves a simple list with basic tasks, and she sets up his coffee pot. She thinks it's not much, taking less than an hour. But he can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she's critical of his partial efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable. The tasks listed are basic\u2014sweeping floors, doing dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, tidying the living room. These are common household chores. The wife is working while he's home, so maybe she wants the house to be clean when she comes back. She doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous, just simple things. She even helps by setting up his coffee. That seems like a fair gesture to make it easier for him.\n\nBut the husband isn't doing it. He's not completing the tasks, and when the wife points out he's only done part of it, he gets snippy. The wife is upset because she feels the expectations are reasonable. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Is expecting a spouse to do chores unreasonable? Maybe in some relationships, chores are shared, but if the husband is home, maybe he should be doing them. The wife is at work, so she's not there to do them herself. However, the husband's refusal to do all the tasks and getting snippy could be a problem. The wife's tone is that she's not expecting much, which might be valid. If the tasks are simple and time-efficient, she's not unreasonable. But maybe she's not considering his feelings or the fact that he might not want to do chores. Or maybe the husband isn't contributing enough. But the key issue is whether she's wrong to expect this.\n\nAnother point: The wife leaves a list, which is a clear expectation. The husband's reaction is negative when she points out his incomplete work. That could indicate a lack of communication or respect. The wife isn't asking for anything extreme. So maybe the husband is the one in the wrong here. But the question is if the wife is in the wrong. If she's setting reasonable expectations and the husband isn't meeting them, then she's not wrong for expecting it. However, maybe she's not considering his perspective or the effort involved. But the tasks are simple. So, maybe she's not wrong. Alternatively, if the husband is not willing to help, maybe the wife is overstepping. But the tasks are basic. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's asking for reasonable help with household chores while she's working, and the husband's non-cooperation and snippiness make him the one at fault.\n"
