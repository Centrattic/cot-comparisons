      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, etc., and sets up his coffee. They think it should take less than an hour. The husband isn't doing it and gets snippy when she's not happy with partial completion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Expectations in a marriage can vary. If the couple hasn't discussed or agreed on household responsibilities, this could be a point of contention. The author might feel it's fair to ask for some help, especially since they're both working. But the husband's refusal and the snippiness suggest possible resentment or differing views on household chores.\n\nIs the author wrong for expecting help? It's common for couples to share chores, but there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The key points here are communication and mutual agreement. If the husband isn't on board with sharing chores, maybe the author didn't set clear expectations. However, the tasks seem reasonable and not excessive. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) might indicate an issue with the approach rather than the request itself.\n\nAnother angle: the author is working, so expecting the husband to manage some chores at home could be seen as fair. But if the husband is not willing, it's a problem of cooperation. The author is not asking for much, so the \"wrong\" might not lie with them. However, without prior agreement, it's possible they're assuming the husband should know or be willing without being asked. Alternatively, the husband might feel unappreciated or overburdened even with simple tasks.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the expectations are reasonable and if there's a lack of communication. Here, the author does leave a list, so they're making their expectations clear. The husband's resistance and the snippiness might be his own issues, which could make the author not in the wrong. However, if the husband has his own responsibilities or if the workload isn't balanced, that's a factor. But based on the info given, the author's request seems modest and reasonable. The husband's reaction is problematic, which might mean the author isn't wrong for expecting help.\n"
