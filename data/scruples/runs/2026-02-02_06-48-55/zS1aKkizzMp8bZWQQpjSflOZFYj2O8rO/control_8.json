      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The question is about expecting their husband to clean the house while he's home and she's at work. The key points here are the expectations and mutual responsibilities in a marriage.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have a simple cleaning list: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, and tidy the living room. They don't ask for anything gross or meticulous. They even set up the coffee pot for him. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did part of the list. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nIn relationships, chores are often shared responsibilities. The author isn't asking for much\u2014basic tasks that shouldn't take long. If the husband is home while the author is at work, it's reasonable for him to handle these tasks. The fact that he gets defensive when she checks the list suggests he might be avoiding responsibility or not contributing equally. \n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't communicate expectations clearly? But she says she left a simple list, so that's unlikely. The husband's reaction of being snippy indicates he's not willing to take responsibility, which is a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable here; she's setting clear, minimal expectations. The husband's failure to meet them without valid reason makes him the one at fault.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
