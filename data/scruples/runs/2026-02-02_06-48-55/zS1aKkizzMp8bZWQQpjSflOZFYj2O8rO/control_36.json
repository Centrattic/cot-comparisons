      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they should be the one at fault for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details given. The author leaves a simple list of tasks for their husband to do\u2014sweeping floors, doing dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. These don't seem like overly demanding tasks. The author even sets up his coffee pot, which is a kind gesture. They mention that these tasks should take less than an hour, so it's a reasonable time frame.\n\nNow, the husband isn't doing these tasks and gets snippy when the author points out he's only completed 3/4. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting this. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about mutual respect and shared responsibilities in a relationship. If both partners are working, it's reasonable to expect some level of shared household duties. The author isn't asking for perfection or excessive work, just basic maintenance. The husband's resentment might stem from feeling unfairly burdened, but the author's expectations seem reasonable. \n\nHowever, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for having these expectations, but maybe they could be more understanding of their husband's workload or stress. Conversely, if the husband consistently refuses to help without valid reason, that might be his issue. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's accountability. The author is asking if they're wrong for expecting the tasks. Since they're not being unreasonable and are contributing themselves (setting up coffee), it's more likely the husband's behavior is problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
