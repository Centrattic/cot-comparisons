      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about expectations regarding household chores between spouses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author expects her husband to clean the house while she's at work. The tasks are simple: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up clothes, tidy the living room. She leaves a list and even sets up his coffee. She thinks it's manageable under an hour. However, he either can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she criticizes him for not doing all the tasks. The author is asking if she's at fault.\n\nNow, common factors in such situations include communication, shared responsibilities, and mutual respect. The author seems to have a clear list and has set up some helpful actions (like making the coffee). But maybe the husband feels overwhelmed or the expectations are mismatched. However, the problem isn't just about the tasks but the husband's reaction. Getting snippy suggests a communication issue or maybe resentment about the division of labor.\n\nIn many relationships, sharing household chores is expected. The author isn't asking for much, just basic maintenance. If the husband is home and the author is at work, it's reasonable for her to expect him to take care of the house during his time. However, the husband's refusal and negative reaction might indicate deeper issues, such as not valuing her contribution or not wanting to take on the responsibility. \n\nBut maybe the husband has valid reasons\u2014perhaps he has a job that makes him tired, or he doesn't know how to do the tasks efficiently. The author might not have considered these factors. However, she did set up the list and made it simple, which should help. The fact that he gets snippy when she points out he didn't do all the tasks shows a lack of cooperation and possibly disrespect.\n\nFrom a societal standpoint, it's common for couples to divide chores. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The husband's behavior is more concerning because he's not fulfilling his part and reacting poorly. The author's request isn't excessive, and she's even making it easy for him. Therefore, the husband is likely the one in the wrong here. The author isn't wrong for expecting her partner to contribute when she's away, especially with clear instructions. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
