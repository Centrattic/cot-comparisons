      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're both working. They mention a simple list of tasks, and the husband isn't doing them, getting snippy when she's upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author left a list of basic chores\u2014sweeping, dishes, making the bed, tidying up. They set up the coffee pot, so they're contributing. The husband isn't doing the chores and gets defensive when she points it out. \n\nBut why might the author be in the wrong? Well, maybe they didn't discuss expectations beforehand. If they didn't have an agreement about chores, expecting the husband to know without communication could be an issue. Also, maybe the husband isn't used to doing these tasks, or there's a lack of teamwork. The author might be assigning tasks without considering his perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband not doing his share and getting snippy is problematic. If they have mutual responsibilities, both should contribute. The author isn't asking for much, so maybe the husband isn't meeting his part of the bargain. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If they didn't set clear expectations or maybe didn't consider that the husband might have different views on chores, then the author could share some responsibility. However, if the husband is neglecting his responsibilities without discussion, maybe he's at fault. \n\nI think the author's problem is that they're expecting the husband to do his part without mutual agreement. Maybe they need to have a conversation about household responsibilities instead of just leaving a list. So the author might be partially in the wrong for not discussing this beforehand. But the husband's reaction is also poor. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because they didn't communicate expectations properly, leading to the conflict.\n"
