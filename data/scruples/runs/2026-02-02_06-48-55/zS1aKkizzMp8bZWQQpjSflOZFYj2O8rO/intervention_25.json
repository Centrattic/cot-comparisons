      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The wife leaves a simple list of chores, and the husband doesn't do them all, getting snippy when she's not happy. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife expects her husband to clean while she's away. She says it's a simple list that shouldn't take long. The husband isn't doing it and gets defensive. She's setting up his coffee, which is a nice gesture. But does she have the right to expect him to clean without more discussion?\n\nHmm. In many relationships, household responsibilities are shared, but expectations can vary. If they haven't discussed this beforehand, maybe the wife's assumption is a problem. She might be putting too much on him without considering his workload or if he's even able to do the tasks. Also, the husband's reaction is snippy, which isn't helpful. But the wife might feel she's not wrong for expecting help, especially if she's working.\n\nWait, but the key point is whether the expectation is unreasonable. A simple list of basic chores sounds fair. However, if the husband isn't willing or able to contribute, maybe the wife should have had a conversation instead of just expecting. Or maybe the husband isn't being considerate. The fact that she's setting up his coffee is a positive, but maybe she's not considering his perspective. Also, the part where she \"doesn't ask him to do anything particularly gross or meticulous\" suggests she's aware it's not too much, which supports her stance. But again, maybe the husband has other responsibilities or isn't interested in cleaning. Without communication, both sides might be at fault. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. If the author is expecting her husband to do chores without discussing it, maybe she's assuming he should know. But if the chores are basic and she's made a list, perhaps it's reasonable. The husband's snippiness is his fault, but the author's expectation could be seen as reasonable. However, maybe she's not considering his feelings or workload. But the chores are minimal. \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, expecting a spouse to help with basic chores while the other is at work seems fair. On the other hand, maybe she should have discussed it more. But given the information, the chores are simple and she's providing support (setting up coffee). The husband's behavior is worse. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
