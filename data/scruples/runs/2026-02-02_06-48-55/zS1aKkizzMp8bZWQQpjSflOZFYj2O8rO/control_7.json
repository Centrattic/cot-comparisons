      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author leaves a simple list of chores: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, and tidy the living room. They mention it should take less than an hour and that they set up the coffee pot for him. The husband doesn't do it and gets snippy when she's not happy with partial completion.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations in relationships. Housework is often a shared responsibility, but how it's divided can vary. The author didn't ask for much, just basic tasks. The husband not doing his share and being snippy when she points out he didn't complete everything could be an issue. \n\nBut maybe there's more to the story. Are there other responsibilities? Does the husband have other duties? The author might be assuming the husband should handle this, but maybe he's not able to due to other commitments. However, the author mentions he can't or won't do it, which suggests he's not making an effort. \n\nAlso, the tone of the husband getting snippy when she's not praising him for doing part of the work is a red flag. It seems like he's not taking the tasks seriously and is being defensive. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners contribute to household chores. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is reasonable. The husband's refusal to comply and the negative reaction when confronted might indicate he's not sharing the workload fairly. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be contributing. Maybe they should communicate better about expectations. But given the description, it seems the husband isn't fulfilling his part. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't wrong for expecting their husband to help with basic chores. The husband's behavior is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
