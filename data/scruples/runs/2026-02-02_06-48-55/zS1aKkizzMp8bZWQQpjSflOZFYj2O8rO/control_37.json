      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. The author leaves a simple list of tasks that take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she's not praising him for doing part of it.\n\nHmm. So first, the question is about whether expecting a spouse to do basic housekeeping is unreasonable. The author doesn't ask for much\u2014just some basic cleaning tasks. They also set up his coffee pot, which might be a nice gesture. The husband's reaction is being snippy and not doing the tasks. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about shared responsibilities in a marriage. If both partners are working and away from home, it's common for them to split chores. The author is asking her husband to handle the cleaning when she's not there, which seems like a reasonable expectation. The husband not doing it and reacting poorly could indicate a problem in communication or attitude.\n\nBut then, maybe there's more context. The author expects him to do it while he's at home. If he's home, maybe he's busy or has other responsibilities. However, the tasks are simple and take less than an hour, so time management might be an issue. Also, the husband getting \"snippy\" when she criticizes his partial efforts suggests he's defensive or maybe not taking the tasks seriously. That could be a sign of disrespect or unwillingness to contribute.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is setting expectations by leaving a list. That's a good approach. But maybe she's being too strict? If the husband is doing some tasks but not all, and she's harsh in her criticism, that might lead to tension. However, he's not doing the cleaning at all, which is the main issue. The author is not asking for perfection, just a basic list. So maybe the husband is in the wrong for not meeting the agreed-upon responsibilities.\n\nWait, the husband can't or won't do it. If he \"can't,\" maybe there's a valid reason, but the author says he \"can\u2019t/won\u2019t,\" implying she thinks it's a choice. So if it's within his capability and he's refusing, that's a problem. Also, getting snippy when she's not praising him for partial work is not helpful. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. It's a teamwork situation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
