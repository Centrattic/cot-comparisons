      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a spouse who expects their husband to clean the house while they are at work. They leave a simple list: sweep floors, do dishes, make the bed, pick up dirty clothes, and tidy the living room. They mention they don't ask for much and even set up the coffee pot for him. They think it should take less than an hour. The husband can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she doesn't praise him for doing 3/4 of the tasks. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a marriage regarding chores. It's common for couples to have different views on household responsibilities. The author is setting clear expectations with a list, which is reasonable. The tasks listed are simple and not overly time-consuming. However, the husband isn't completing them, which leads to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and communication. The author feels the tasks are minimal and fair, but the husband is resistant or unable to do them. The husband's reaction (getting snippy) when not praised suggests possible resentment or differing priorities in chore division.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being fair. They mention they don't expect much, but maybe the husband feels the workload is unfair, especially if he's also working. However, the author is setting up the coffee pot, which shows they are trying to make things easier for him, which could indicate a balanced approach.\n\nThe conflict arises when the husband does only part of the tasks and then expects praise, which the author doesn't give. The husband's snippiness might indicate he's not taking responsibility for his part in the chores. The author's frustration is understandable, as they're not asking for much, but they might need to communicate better or reassess the division of labor.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's possible that the author isn't entirely wrong. They have communicated their expectations clearly. However, it's also possible that the author isn't considering the husband's perspective or workload. But given the information, the author's actions seem reasonable. The husband's behavior (not completing tasks and being snippy) is more indicative of the issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've set reasonable expectations and are trying to share responsibilities. The problem lies in the husband's reluctance and negative response. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
