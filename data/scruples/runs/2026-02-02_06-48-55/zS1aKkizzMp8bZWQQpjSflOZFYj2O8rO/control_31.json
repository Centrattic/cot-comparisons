      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person expects their husband to clean the house while he's at home and she's at work. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snappy when she points out he didn't finish everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author says she doesn't ask for much\u2014basic cleaning tasks. She even sets up his coffee pot, which is a nice gesture. The husband isn't doing the tasks and is getting snippy when she checks on them. \n\nNow, in relationships, sharing household responsibilities is usually expected. If the wife is working and the husband is at home, it's fair to expect him to handle some chores. The list seems reasonable. The husband's behavior of not doing the tasks and being snippy suggests he's not meeting his end of the bargain. \n\nBut maybe there's more context. Maybe the husband has other responsibilities or they have a different system. The author mentions that she leaves a list, so she's trying to be clear. The husband not doing it and being snippy might indicate laziness or resentment. \n\nHowever, it's possible that the husband feels the expectations are unreasonable. But the tasks listed are basic and take an hour. It's hard to see how that's too much. Also, the husband's reaction when he only does part of it is problematic. \n\nSo, the key points are: reasonable tasks, clear communication, husband not following through and being snippy. The author isn't wrong for expecting help with chores, especially when she's working. The husband is the one not fulfilling his responsibilities and being rude about it. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
