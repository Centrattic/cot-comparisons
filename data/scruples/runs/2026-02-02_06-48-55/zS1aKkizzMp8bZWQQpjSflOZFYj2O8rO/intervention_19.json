      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The author leaves a simple list of tasks that take less than an hour. The husband doesn't do them and gets snippy when she points out he didn't complete everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is setting expectations with a list. They mention it's not much and even set up the coffee pot for the husband. So, they're trying to be considerate. The husband isn't meeting those expectations and is getting snappy when reminded. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on several factors. Household responsibilities can be a common source of conflict in relationships. If both partners are contributing equally, that's ideal. But if one expects the other to take on all the cleaning without any compromise, that could be an issue. However, in this case, the author is asking if expecting a shared task is unreasonable. The tasks listed are minimal, so maybe not. \n\nThe husband's reaction is also a point. Getting snippy when reminded might indicate resentment or lack of willingness to contribute. The author is not demanding something unreasonable but is pointing out incomplete tasks. If the husband isn't willing to help, the author's expectations might be reasonable, but maybe the way it's communicated is an issue. However, the author states they don't expect much and it's a simple list. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're asking for a fair share of chores. The husband's refusal and bad attitude are problematic. But maybe there's an underlying issue in their communication or agreement on responsibilities. However, based on the information given, it seems the husband isn't meeting his end, so the author isn't at fault.\n"
