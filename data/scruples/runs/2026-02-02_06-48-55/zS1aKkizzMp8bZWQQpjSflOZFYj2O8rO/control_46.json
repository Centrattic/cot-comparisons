      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. The author mentions she leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She says it's not a lot and should take less than an hour. The husband can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he only did 3/4 of the tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is working while her husband is at home, so it's a common situation where one partner is home and can handle more chores. The tasks listed aren't excessive. However, the husband's reaction is negative, which might indicate a deeper issue in their relationship, like communication problems or differing expectations about household responsibilities.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the tasks are simple and minimal, the author sets up his coffee pot, and the husband doesn't meet the expectations. The author isn't demanding perfection, just a basic level of cleanliness. The husband's snippiness when 25% of the tasks aren't done might be his own issue, perhaps resentment or not valuing the effort she puts into organizing.\n\nIn many relationships, sharing household chores is expected. The author is asking her husband to do a small part to help her while she's working. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute to maintaining the home, especially when the other is occupied with work. The husband's refusal without a valid reason and the negative reaction could make him the wrong one here. However, the author might be assuming too much without discussing the division of labor. Open communication is key in such situations.\n\nBut the author's list is minimal, and the time required is reasonable. The husband's behavior (getting snippy) is uncooperative and dismissive. The author isn't wrong for expecting basic help, especially when she's contributing by setting up his coffee. The husband's failure to meet even simple expectations without a good reason might make him the one at fault. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
