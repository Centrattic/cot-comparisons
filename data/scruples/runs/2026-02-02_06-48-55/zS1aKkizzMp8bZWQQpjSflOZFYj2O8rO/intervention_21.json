      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. She leaves a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. She mentions it shouldn't take more than an hour and that he doesn't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if it's reasonable to expect a spouse to share household chores. In many relationships, splitting chores is common, so expecting him to do some cleaning when she's working could be seen as fair. But maybe she's being too demanding? The list is simple, but the key issue is the expectation and the husband's reaction.\n\nThe husband is at home, so maybe he has his own responsibilities or tasks. If the author is expecting him to clean while he's presumably resting or doing nothing, that might be a problem. But if she's working and he's also working or has other duties, then it's more about equal sharing. \n\nAlso, the husband's attitude: getting snippy and not wanting to do the tasks. That's not good. He's not fulfilling his part, which is a problem. But the author's approach\u2014leaving a list and maybe being critical when he doesn't complete it\u2014might be contributing to the conflict. Maybe he feels it's micromanaging or that she's not appreciative. \n\nThe author says she doesn't ask for anything gross or meticulous, so it's not unreasonable. However, the phrasing \"hit my knees to praise him\" suggests that when he does 3/4, she's not happy. Maybe she's being too harsh. If he's doing most of it, but she's not acknowledging that and instead focusing on the one thing he missed, that could be creating resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, if the husband is consistently not doing his part, the author is right to address it. The problem here is the mutual expectation versus the mutual effort. The author might be in the right if this is a regular occurrence and the husband isn't contributing, but if it's a one-time thing or if the husband has a valid reason, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer hinges on communication and the overall balance in the relationship. If the author hasn't discussed this with her husband and just assumes he should do it without considering his perspective, she might be in the wrong. But if they've agreed on splitting chores and he's not honoring that, then he's not in the right. The situation seems to highlight a lack of communication and mutual respect. \n\nGiven that the husband is at home, perhaps he's supposed to be doing something else. The author might be overburdening him, but the tasks are minimal. It's possible that both parties have issues: the author expects some help, and the husband resists. But the husband's reaction is definitely unhelpful. \n\nSo, in terms of assigning blame, the author might not be in the wrong if she's setting reasonable expectations. However, the way she's handling it (maybe being critical, not considering his feelings) could be part of the problem. The husband's behavior is clearly problematic. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I'm not sure. If she's asking for a fair share and the husband refuses, she's not wrong for expecting help. The snippiness and the husband's unwillingness are his issues. The answer would likely be B (No) because she's not in the wrong for expecting a reasonable amount of help. However, maybe the author is in the wrong if the expectations aren't mutual or if the husband isn't in a position to do the cleaning. But the tasks are simple and take an hour. So probably B.\n"
