      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author leaves a simple cleaning list expecting their husband to do it. They mention it's not a lot and takes less than an hour. The husband isn't doing it and gets snippy when she points out he's only done part of it. She also sets up his coffee, which is a nice touch. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. I need to consider if her expectations are reasonable. The tasks are basic and not onerous. However, in a relationship, how responsibilities are divided can vary. Some people might think it's fair to split household chores, but if the husband isn't contributing and gets defensive, that could be a problem. \n\nBut the key here is the husband's behavior. He's not doing the tasks and is getting snippy when reminded. The author isn't being overly demanding; she's setting clear expectations. She's also doing something considerate (making his coffee), which might indicate she's trying to be helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband feels the expectations are unfair, especially if he's working and coming home tired. But the author isn't asking for anything excessive. The husband's reaction is negative, which could be his issue, not hers. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's setting reasonable expectations and the husband isn't meeting them. The problem seems to lie with the husband's unwillingness and his snippiness. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
