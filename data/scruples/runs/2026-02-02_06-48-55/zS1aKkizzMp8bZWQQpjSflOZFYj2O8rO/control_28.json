      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is at fault for expecting their husband to clean the house while they're at work. The writer says they leave a simple list with basic tasks like sweeping, dishes, making the bed, picking up clothes, and tidying the living room. They mention it's not much and takes under an hour. The husband either can't or won't do it and gets snippy when she points out he didn't finish 3/4 of the tasks. The writer then asks if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the expectation. The tasks listed are basic household chores. It's common for couples to share chores, so expecting a partner to handle some cleaning while the other is away might be reasonable. However, the key points here are the communication and the husband's reaction. The writer mentions the husband gets snippy when she points out he didn't complete all tasks. That suggests there's a communication issue or maybe differing expectations about how the chores should be divided.\n\nThe writer provided a list and set up his coffee pot, which shows they're trying to make things easier for him. The husband's reaction is negative when corrected, which might indicate he's not taking responsibility willingly. The question is whether the expectation itself is unreasonable. The tasks are simple and time-efficient, so the expectation isn't over the top. However, the husband's response and lack of action might point to deeper issues in their relationship, like unequal workload or communication problems.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the writer's fault. If the chores are reasonable and the husband is refusing to do them, the writer isn't in the wrong for setting those expectations. The problem might be the husband's unwillingness to contribute, not the writer's request. So the answer would be B, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
