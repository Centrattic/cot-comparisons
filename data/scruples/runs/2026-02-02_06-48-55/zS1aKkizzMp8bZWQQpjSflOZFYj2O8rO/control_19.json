      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about expecting her husband to clean the house while she's at work and he's at home. She leaves a simple list of tasks that should take less than an hour. He doesn't do them all and gets snippy when she's not super happy with his partial efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a relationship. Both partners usually share household responsibilities, right? But maybe the way the tasks are assigned or the expectations are causing issues. The author is setting up a list, which is a common way to delegate chores. She's not asking for anything too gross or time-consuming. She even helps him by setting up his coffee, which is a kind gesture.\n\nNow, the husband isn't doing the tasks and is getting snippy when she's not satisfied with his partial work. That seems like a problem. If he's supposed to do the chores and he's not following through, maybe he's not fulfilling his part. But then, maybe the expectations are too high. The author is at work, so maybe she's not present to help or remind him. But she's setting clear tasks, so he should know what's expected.\n\nThe key here might be communication. If the author's expectations aren't clearly communicated or if the husband isn't on board with the division of labor, that could be a problem. However, she does leave a list, which suggests she's clear. The husband's reaction is also important. Getting snippy when expectations aren't met can strain a relationship. But is the author wrong for having these expectations?\n\nIt's possible that the author is not in the wrong because she's setting reasonable tasks and helping him with the coffee. She's not asking for much. The husband's failure to complete the tasks and his negative reaction might be his issue. Alternatively, maybe the author should be more flexible or have a conversation about sharing chores instead of expecting him to do all while she's away.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the husband is overwhelmed or has other responsibilities. But the author mentions it's a simple list taking less than an hour. If he can't manage that, perhaps there's a deeper issue. However, the husband's behavior (being snippy) indicates a lack of cooperation.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners contribute. If the author is working and the husband is at home, maybe the chores should be split differently. But she's not asking for a lot. The fact that he does 3/4 and then she's not happy might be a communication breakdown. However, the husband's reaction (snippiness) is unhelpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's expectations seem reasonable. The husband is not meeting them and reacting poorly. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because she's setting clear, simple tasks and supporting him with the coffee. The problem lies with the husband not fulfilling his part and his negative attitude.\n"
