On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for things. The author's situation is that their adult kids moved back home, they cover housing, utilities, food, some fun expenses, gas, insurance. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starts soon. The author asked them to help with chores, but when they didn't do much, the author got angry and yelled about them taking cousin out and not showing appreciation. The son also says the author's payments make him feel owned.\n\nFirst, the author is a parent, and the kids are adults. It's reasonable for parents to expect some help, especially since they're living in the same house. But the author is paying for a lot, so maybe there's an imbalance. The kids aren't working yet, so maybe they can't contribute financially. However, chores are a basic part of living in a shared space. The author is working long hours, so maybe they're stressed and the stress is showing through yelling. The son's comment about feeling owned is a red flag. The author's reaction might be coming from a place of frustration, but yelling and implying that their generosity should be met with gratitude could be seen as manipulative or expecting something in return for not charging rent. \n\nBut then again, it's the parent's home, so they have the right to set expectations for household responsibilities. The kids are adults, so they should contribute where possible. However, if the author is using money as a way to control or make the kids feel indebted, that's a problem. The key point is whether the author is demanding help in return for covering their expenses, which might be a form of emotional manipulation. Alternatively, it's about shared responsibility in a household. The author's anger and the son's reaction suggest that communication is breaking down. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be better. They might have a right to expect help, but the way they expressed it (yelling, implying ownership) is problematic. It's possible they're conflating financial support with household responsibilities. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because parents can set expectations for chores in their home, but the tone and method are questionable. However, some might argue that the author is using financial support as leverage, making them at fault. Hmm. Need to balance these aspects.\n"
