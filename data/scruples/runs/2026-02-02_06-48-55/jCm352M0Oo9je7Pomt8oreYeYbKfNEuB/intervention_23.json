On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The situation is that both kids moved back home, the parents are working long hours, and the kids aren't contributing much help. The parents gave money for fun things, gas, insurance, etc. The son is in college, the daughter starts a job soon. The mom got angry when the son didn't do the dishes, mentioning that they spent money on their cousin.\n\nHmm. The author's perspective is that they're paying for a lot and expecting some help. But the kids are adults. The son's response was about setting up his room, and he feels the money is making the mom feel she owns him. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting help in exchange for financial support.\n\nI think the key points here are the expectations of adult children. It's common for parents to expect some chores from their kids, especially when they're living under the same roof and the parents are working hard. However, the author might be overstepping if they're framing it as a transactional exchange. Like, maybe they're not being clear about what is expected. Also, the son's comment about feeling owned suggests that the author's approach might be coming off as controlling instead of collaborative. But the mom is justified in wanting help, right? Because it's a shared household. It's a balance between being a parent and respecting their independence. Maybe the author isn't wrong in expecting help, but the way they expressed it\u2014like yelling about paying for their cousin's outing\u2014could be problematic. The tone and the implication that money entitles them to control might be where they're wrong. So the answer could be A. But I need to check if the expectation itself is wrong. If the parents are providing a home and financial support, it's reasonable to expect some basic chores. However, if they're treating it like payment for chores, that's different. The author's approach might be more about control rather than shared responsibility. So the author might be in the wrong for framing it as a transaction and not being clear on expectations. Therefore, answer A.\n"
