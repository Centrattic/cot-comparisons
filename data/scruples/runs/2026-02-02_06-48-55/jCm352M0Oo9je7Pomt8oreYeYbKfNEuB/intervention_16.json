On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for a lot of things.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both children are adults, moved back home, and the parents are paying for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun stuff. The kids aren't working yet (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parents work long hours. The author asked the son to do dishes, and he was preoccupied with moving in. The author got upset and yelled, mentioning that they paid for their outing with the cousin.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're at fault for expecting help in exchange for financial support. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. On one hand, it's common for parents to expect some chores from adult children living at home, especially when they contribute financially. But on the other hand, the kids aren't working, and their response might indicate resentment or feeling forced. The son's comment about the author paying to feel in control could be a red flag. The author's frustration is understandable, but yelling might have been harsh. However, asking for help with chores isn't unreasonable. The key points are: are the expectations reasonable, and was the response appropriate? The author might not be in the wrong, but maybe their approach was too aggressive. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong, but there's nuance.\n"
