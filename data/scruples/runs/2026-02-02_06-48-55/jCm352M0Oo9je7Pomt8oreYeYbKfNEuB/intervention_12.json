On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parents are working long hours, providing housing, utilities, food, and even covering expenses for their kids. The kids, both in their early 20s, moved back home. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. Neither has a job yet. The parents ask them to help with chores, and when they don't, the parents get upset and yell, especially after giving them money for activities. The son responds by implying the parents are trying to control him through money.\n\nNow, the key points here: Are the parents in the wrong for expecting help? Well, it's their home, and they're providing for the kids. It's reasonable for them to expect some level of responsibility in return. But there's a line. The parents are working a lot, and the kids are trying to get their lives together. The son moving out of a suitcase and needing to set up his dresser might need some time and understanding. The mother's reaction\u2014yelling and bringing up past money expenses\u2014could come off as using guilt or financial pressure. The son's comment about feeling owned is a red flag. Maybe the approach was too harsh, making the kids defensive instead of cooperative.\n\nBut the parents have a right to set expectations. They\u2019re providing a lot, and expecting some help isn't unreasonable. However, the way they're handling it might be part of the problem. Yelling and using money as a leverage could be manipulative. The kids might feel they're being controlled, which complicates the dynamic. It's a balance between setting boundaries and respecting the kids' autonomy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. While expecting help is fair, the method of enforcing it through guilt-tripping or yelling might be where they're at fault. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the parents being in a reasonable position but perhaps handling it poorly. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer could be B (No), but with the note that their approach could be improved.\n"
