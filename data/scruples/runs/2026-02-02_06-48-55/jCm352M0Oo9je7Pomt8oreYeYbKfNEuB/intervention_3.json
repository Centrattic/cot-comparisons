On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for a lot of things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent has two adult kids, a 21-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter, who moved back home. The parents are working over 50 hours a week each and cover the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The kids aren't working, one is in college and the other is starting a job soon. The mom asks them to clean up, they do some things, but when she asks the son to do the dishes, he makes an excuse. She gets angry and yells about them taking her money to spend on their cousin and accuses them of thinking she owns them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nSo, from the parent's perspective, they're providing a lot of support, and expecting some help with chores is reasonable. But since the kids are adults, maybe the parent should approach it differently. However, the parent's reaction was yelling and making an accusation that the son felt like she owns him. That might be where the author is in the wrong. The parent could have asked more calmly and set clear expectations. Also, the kids are in a transitional phase (college, starting a job), so maybe their priorities are different. The parent might be overstepping by using guilt or anger instead of setting boundaries respectfully.\n\nBut then, expecting help in a shared living space is normal. The problem might be the approach rather than the expectation. The key issue here is the parent's reaction. Yelling and accusations can be counterproductive. So maybe the author is in the wrong because of the way they handled it, not the expectation itself. It's about how they communicated their needs. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and the accusation, even if the underlying request is reasonable.\n"
