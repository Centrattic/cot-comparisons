Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is a parent with two adult children who moved back home. The parents are covering all the basics\u2014house, utilities, food, plus some extra expenses like gas, insurance, and money for fun things. The kids aren't working yet; one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours a week each.\n\nThe parent got upset when the son didn't help with chores, especially after paying for a dinner outing for the kids and their cousin. The son felt the parent was trying to control him through money. The parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting help in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the parent is providing a lot of financial support, which is understandable. But the key question is whether it's fair to expect chores in return. In many cultures, it's common for family members to contribute to household chores regardless of financial support. However, adult children might have different expectations, especially if they're used to living independently or if the parent hasn't set clear expectations before.\n\nThe parent mentions they're not a clean freak, so the request for help isn't excessive. The son's response about the parent owning him through money is problematic. It suggests resentment or a power struggle, which the parent might have inadvertently triggered by linking financial support to chores. The parent's reaction of yelling could have been a result of frustration, but using guilt or financial leverage might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is working long hours and might feel overwhelmed. Their request for help isn't unreasonable, but the way it's handled matters. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could have approached it differently. Setting clear expectations from the start about household responsibilities and discussing them calmly might have avoided the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has a valid point about contributing to the household, their approach of using the financial support as leverage might have been inappropriate. They might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for a more collaborative approach.\n"
