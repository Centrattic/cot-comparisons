He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for everything.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's two adult kids moved back home. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids don't have jobs, though one is in college and the other starts soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asked them to help with chores, and when they didn't, the author got angry and yelled about it. The son responded by saying the money makes the author feel like they own him.\n\nHmm. So the author is upset that the kids aren't helping out despite the support. The key points here are the expectations of the parents versus the children's contributions. The parents are providing a lot, but the kids are not working. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting help around the house as a form of appreciation.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In many cultures, it's common for family members to contribute to household chores regardless of age, especially if they're living under the same roof. However, the kids are adults, so maybe there's a different expectation compared to when they were younger. But since they're not paying rent or contributing financially, the parents might feel entitled to some help.\n\nThe author's anger might be justified because they're providing a lot and expecting some reciprocal help. But the tone of yelling and the comment about the money making them feel owned could be problematic. The son's reaction suggests that the way the request was made might have been harsh, leading to resentment. However, the core issue is whether the expectation itself is fair. \n\nThe kids are in a position where they might not have the same obligations as traditional employed adults, but living at home often comes with some responsibilities. The parents are working long hours and might be stretched thin, so expecting some help is reasonable. However, the approach\u2014yelling and making them feel guilty\u2014might not be the best method. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the expectation, not the method.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's expectation isn't unreasonable. They're providing support and asking for help in return. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, the way they expressed it could be improved. But the main question is about being in the wrong for the request itself.\n"
