On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The situation involves two adult children who moved back in, the parents work long hours, and the parents are providing financial support. The author got upset when their son didn't help with chores and yelled about it, citing financial contributions as a reason for expecting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The children are adults, so the parents might be expecting some level of independence and responsibility. However, the parents are clearly providing a lot: housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The son's response about feeling owned by his mother is a red flag. That suggests there might be an underlying issue in the parent-child dynamic, possibly control or resentment.\n\nThe author's approach seems to be using financial contributions as a reason for expecting chores. But in adult children, it's important to foster autonomy. Expecting help is reasonable, but tying it to financial support could be seen as manipulative. The son's reaction indicates that he might feel the author is using money as a tool to control him, which isn't healthy.\n\nAlso, the author's tone when they yelled might have been harsh. Using guilt or anger over helping with chores can create a negative environment. It's possible that the children aren't used to contributing and need a different approach, like setting clear expectations without using financial support as leverage.\n\nOn the other hand, it's fair for parents to expect some reciprocal help, especially when they're supporting adult children financially. The key issue here is the method and framing. The author might not be wrong in wanting help, but their approach might be problematic. However, given that the children are adults and the parents are working long hours, it's reasonable to ask for assistance in maintaining the home.\n\nBut considering the son's reaction and the author's use of money as a reason for help, there's a power imbalance. The author could be seen as in the wrong if they're using financial support to enforce chores, which can erode the children's autonomy. The right approach would be to set boundaries and expectations collaboratively without guilt-tripping.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the method used to enforce help is based on financial control rather than mutual respect. The author's reaction and the son's feelings of being owned suggest that the approach is flawed, even if the expectation of help is understandable.\n"
