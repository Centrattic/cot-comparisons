He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children, both in their early 20s, who moved back home. They're paying for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The kids aren't working, one is in college, the other is about to start. The author is asking them to help with chores, which they did a bit. The son didn't do the dishes, leading the author to yell about them not showing appreciation for the money spent, like taking their cousin out to eat and drink.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations. The author is paying for a lot, so they expect help. The kids are adults, so there's a debate on whether they should contribute. The author's anger might come from feeling taken for granted, but the kids are in a transition phase. The son's comment about the author paying to feel like they own him is a red flag. Maybe there's resentment from the kids' side.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't wrong to want help. It's reasonable to expect some contribution when you're supporting someone. However, the way the author expressed it\u2014yelling and implying ownership\u2014might be harsh. The kids might have valid reasons for not helping, like stress from school or starting a job. The author's approach could be seen as unfair if there's no clear agreement on chores. But overall, the core issue is about mutual expectations and communication. Since the author is providing financial support, expecting some household responsibilities isn't unreasonable. The kids being adults means they should have some responsibility. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
