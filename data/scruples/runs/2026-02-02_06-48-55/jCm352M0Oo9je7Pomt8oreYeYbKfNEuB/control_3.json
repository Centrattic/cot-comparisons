On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they're paying for various things. \n\nFirst, the situation: both kids are adults, moved back home, and the parents pay for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The parents work long hours. The kids aren't working yet (one in college, the other starting soon). The parent got upset when the son didn't do the dishes after being asked, and yelled about them not showing appreciation for the money spent on their cousin's outing.\n\nSo, the parent is asking if they're at fault here. Let's break it down. The key points are the expectations of the adult children contributing to household chores. The parent is providing financial support, which is significant, and they're working hard. The children, being adults, might be expected to contribute to household responsibilities. \n\nBut wait, the kids are still in a transitional phase\u2014college and starting a job. They might not have the same capacity to help, especially if they're adjusting to moving back home. The parent mentions they aren't a clean freak, so the expectation isn't extreme. However, the parent is stressed about work and the added responsibility. \n\nThe son's response that the money makes the parent feel like they own him is a red flag. It suggests there's some underlying tension or resentment. The parent's reaction of yelling could be seen as a result of stress and frustration. But is the parent wrong for expecting help? \n\nIn many cultures, when parents support adult children financially, there's often an expectation of reciprocal help around the house. However, it's important to consider whether the demands are reasonable. Since the kids are still adjusting and not working, maybe the parent should be more lenient. On the other hand, expecting basic chores like dishes isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe parent did mention that the kids did help a bit before, so there's some effort. The conflict here seems to be about the parent's frustration building up, leading to an outburst. The parent might be in the right in expecting help but could have handled it differently. However, the main question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's request for help isn't unreasonable, especially given the financial support. The issue might be the approach taken (yelling), but the core expectation isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
