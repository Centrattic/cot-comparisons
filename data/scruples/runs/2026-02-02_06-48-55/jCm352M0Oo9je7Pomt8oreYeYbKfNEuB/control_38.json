On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for things like the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and giving them money for fun. The kids are in their early 20s, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. They moved back home, and the parents work over 50 hours a week.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's fair for the parents to ask for help with chores in exchange for the financial support they're providing. The parents feel like they're doing a lot and want some appreciation through helping out. The son responded by saying that the money makes the parents feel like they own him, which is a defense from the kid's side. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms here. In many cases, when parents support adult children, especially financially, there's an expectation that the children contribute to household chores. It's common for families to have such expectations, especially when multiple people live under the same roof. The parents are providing a lot, so asking for basic help like cleaning up or doing dishes is reasonable. \n\nHowever, the son's reaction seems a bit entitled. He's been living out of a suitcase for three months and just received a dresser. The parents got him that dresser, which is part of the support they're giving. His argument that the money makes them feel they own him is a bit of a cop-out. It's normal for family members to pitch in, especially when they benefit from the household.\n\nThe parents are working long hours, so they're probably stressed and looking for some assistance. The daughter and son aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other starting a job soon. It's understandable they might be adjusting, but some level of contribution is fair. \n\nThe parents also mention that they're not clean freaks, just want a lived-in home. So the expectations aren't unreasonable. The fact that the kids do a couple of things when asked shows they can help, but maybe not consistently. The parent's frustration is valid because they're giving a lot and expecting some reciprocity.\n\nI think the key here is that the parents are asking for appreciation through helping out, which is a natural part of family dynamics. The kids might feel they're entitled because they're receiving support, but that doesn't negate the parents' right to expect some help in return. The son's comment about owing them is a bit harsh and perhaps the parents' reaction of getting angry and yelling might be a bit over the top, but the underlying request isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asking for a fair exchange of support and help in the household. The answer is B.\n"
