On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves adult children moving back home, and the parent is asking them to help with chores. The parent is providing housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other is about to start. The parent works a lot and is asking for help around the house.\n\nSo, the parent is frustrated because the kids aren't contributing equally. When the son didn't do the dishes, the parent got angry and mentioned paying for their outings. The son responds by implying the parent is trying to control him through financial support. The parent is questioning if they're wrong for expecting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation that they should contribute to household responsibilities. Even if the parents are covering most expenses, chores are part of living in a shared space. The parent isn't unreasonable in expecting some level of help, especially given their workload. However, the parent's response might have been a bit harsh. Yelling and bringing up previous expenses could come off as manipulative or unfair, especially if the son felt criticized. The son's comment about the parent \"owning him\" suggests there's some resentment or tension in the parent-child relationship.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the parent is wrong for expecting help. Since the kids are living at home and receiving financial support, the parent's request for basic chores is reasonable. However, the way the parent communicated this might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of yelling and linking chores to financial support, maybe a more collaborative approach would be better. The parent's frustration is valid, but the method of expressing it could be part of the problem here.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for wanting help, but their communication style might be problematic. The answer likely is B (No), because the parent isn't wrong for asking for help, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
