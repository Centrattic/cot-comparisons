On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. Hmm.\n\nThe author's kids are adults, 21 and 20, living at home. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun. Both kids don't have jobs yet (one in college, the other starting soon). The parents work 50+ hours each. The author asked the kids to help with chores, and when they didn't, the author got angry and accused them of thinking the money makes them owed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nFirst, the kids are adults. Parents have a right to set expectations for household responsibilities, especially when they're contributing financially. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. They asked for help, and the son didn't comply, leading to the author's frustration. \n\nBut maybe the author's approach was harsh? Yelling might be a problem. Also, the son's comment about the author paying to \"own\" him suggests there's some resentment. The author's reaction to the previous outing (paying for the cousin's meal) could be seen as conditional\u2014helping in exchange for money. That might not be fair. \n\nHowever, the parents are providing significant support, and it's reasonable to expect some reciprocation. The key issue is whether it's fair to ask for help. Since the children are adults, they should contribute to the household they're living in. The author's mistake might be the tone and the implication that money equates to ownership, but the expectation itself is valid. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because expecting help is reasonable, but the approach could be improved. The author isn't wrong for asking for help, even if the delivery was harsh.\n"
