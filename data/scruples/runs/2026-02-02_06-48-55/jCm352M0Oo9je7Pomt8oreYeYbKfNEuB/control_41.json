On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with housework in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the parents provide a lot: house, utilities, food, money for fun, gas, insurance. Both kids are adults, moved back in, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work long hours. The kids haven't been helping much around the house. The son was asked to do dishes but prioritized his own tasks. The author yells, bringing up the money spent, and the son interprets it as the parents trying to \"own him.\"\n\nSo, the main issue is whether expecting help around the house is reasonable. The parents are not a clean freak, just want the house lived-in. They're covering a lot financially. The kids are adults, so they might be expected to contribute, even if they're not working yet. The son's reaction is defensive, which suggests there's some underlying tension. The parents' yelling might be seen as a harsh response, but their frustration is understandable given the workload and the financial commitment. \n\nThe key points are the reasonableness of the request for help and the appropriateness of the parents' response. The parents aren't asking for a lot, just basic chores. The son's comment about feeling owned implies he might not see the connection between financial support and responsibilities. However, it's common in many families for adult children to help out when living at home, even if parents provide financial support. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for expecting help, especially since they're shouldering a lot of responsibility. The son's defensiveness and the parents' frustration are both on some level valid, but the parents might need a calmer approach in the future. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
