Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about adult children moving back home and the parent feeling they should help around the house. The parent provides housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun things, gas, and insurance. The kids aren't working (one in college, the other starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The parent got upset when the son didn't help with dishes, even though he had been living out of a suitcase for months.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The parent is providing a lot of financial support, expecting some help around the house. The kids aren't working, so maybe they can't contribute financially, so helping with chores is a way to show appreciation. But the parent's reaction was yelling and bringing up money, which the son claims the parent is trying to \"own\" him. The parent might be frustrated after working long hours and expecting some help. However, yelling and using guilt-tripping might be crossing a line. \n\nThe son's response about feeling owned by the parent suggests that the parent's approach is making the son feel coerced rather than genuinely appreciative. The parent's request for help is reasonable, but the way they expressed it (yelling and bringing up past expenses) might be the issue. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the method of communication could be problematic. \n\nIs it wrong to ask for help? Not inherently. But if the parent is using guilt or emotional manipulation, that's where the line might be crossed. The key here is the parent's approach rather than the expectation itself. Since the parent is in a position of authority and providing support, their method of enforcing chores should be respectful. The son's reaction indicates that the parent's approach isn't effective and may be contributing to resentment. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for expecting help, but the way they handled the situation might be part of the problem. However, the question is whether the author (parent) is in the wrong. If the parent's request is reasonable but the communication is poor, does that make them in the wrong? It might depend on cultural expectations and family dynamics. In many cases, parents expect help, but the tone and method matter. Since the parent is working a lot and the kids are in a transition period, the parent's frustration is valid. However, yelling and bringing up past expenses could be seen as unfair. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because the way they expressed their request was harsh, which could undermine their message. The parent might need to communicate differently, focusing on shared responsibility rather than guilt-tripping. But the core expectation isn't wrong. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong overall. If the answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong), the parent's approach is part of the issue, so they are in the wrong. But maybe the main issue is the parent's communication style. Alternatively, maybe the parent isn't wrong because they have a right to expect help. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards A (yes, author is wrong) because their method of expressing the request is causing friction and being manipulative. The son's response indicates that the parent's approach is making him resentful. The parent should expect help but in a respectful manner, not through yelling or guilt-tripping. So the parent's actions are at fault here.\n"
