On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for everything. The author has two adult kids who moved back in, and they're covering rent, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun. The kids aren't working, one is in college, and the other starts a job soon. The author feels they're being taken advantage of and had a confrontation when their son didn't help with dishes.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether it's reasonable to expect adult children to contribute to household chores when they're being supported financially. The author argues they're not a clean freak and the home is lived-in, so it's not about perfection. However, the kids aren't working and are using the resources provided.\n\nThe son's response that the author pays for things to feel like they own him is a red flag. It suggests there's a dynamic where the son feels entitled or resentful. The author's frustration is understandable, especially working long hours. But the key is the balance between support and expectation of contribution. \n\nIn many cultures, adult children living at home are expected to chip in with chores as part of the household. However, if the parent is providing financial support, it's a mutual agreement that might imply some responsibilities. The author's anger over a specific incident where the son prioritized personal tasks over a simple chore might be seen as overreacting, especially if the kids were out with friends last night. But the author's point is that they're paying for the kids' activities, so there's an expectation of reciprocity.\n\nHowever, the son's comment about feeling owned indicates there's a deeper issue of resentment, which the author might have contributed to by not setting clear boundaries earlier. The author might be in the right to expect help, but their approach of yelling and implying guilt (like using the cousin outing as a reason for expectation) could be counterproductive. It's possible that the author's approach is part of the problem, even if their expectations are reasonable. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for how they handled it, even if their expectations are valid.\n"
