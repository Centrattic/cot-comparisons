On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for various expenses. The adult kids moved back home, and the parents are working over 50 hours each week. They give money for fun things, gas, insurance, etc. The kids aren't working, except one is starting a job soon. The author got angry when the son didn't do the dishes after they had paid for a meal with their cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are providing financial support, which is a big deal, especially with adult children. But the question is about whether it's right to expect help in return. The son's response about the parent paying to \"feel like they own him\" is a bit confrontational. The parents might feel that their support is a reason for the kids to contribute, while the kids might feel they're not obligated because they're adults, even if they're living at home.\n\nIn some cultures, it's expected that adult children help with chores when they live with their parents. However, the parents are paying for a lot, which could create a sense of obligation. On the other hand, the parents might be overstepping if they're treating the financial support as a trade for labor. The kids are in a transitional phase\u2014college and starting a job\u2014so maybe they have different priorities. But the parents are working a lot and might be overwhelmed.\n\nThe author's reaction of yelling and getting angry might be excessive. The son had been living out of a suitcase for three months, so setting up his room could be a valid reason for not doing dishes. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it might not be the best approach. The son's comment about the parents' motives could be a defense mechanism if he feels pressured.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The parents are providing support, but expecting help isn't inherently wrong. However, the communication style\u2014yelling and implying they pay for things to \"own\" him\u2014might lead to resentment. Maybe the author should have approached it more calmly and set clear expectations without tying it to financial support. The kids might need to take more responsibility, but the parents' method of enforcing it could be part of the problem. I think the author is partially in the wrong for the tone and framing of the request, but it's a complex situation with valid points on both sides. The answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The key is whether expecting help is wrong. Since they're adults, the parents can't force them, but it's reasonable to ask. The conflict arises from the communication and the son's perception. The author's approach might have been harsh, so maybe they're in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
