But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent has two adult children, both moved back home, and the parent is paying for their housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun stuff. The kids don't have jobs yet, one is in college, the other starts soon. The parent is working 50+ hours a week, their husband too. They've been asking the kids to help with chores, and the kids did some things, but when the parent asked the son to do the dishes, he made an excuse about setting up his new dresser. The parent got angry and accused them of not showing appreciation, especially after paying for them to take their cousin out. The son also seems to resent the parent's payments, thinking it's to control him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities of both the parent and the adult children. The parent is providing significant financial support, which includes living expenses and extras. In return, expecting some household chores seems reasonable. After all, when you live in a shared space, contributing to the chores is a common expectation. But the parent also notes they're not a clean freak and the house is \"very lived in,\" so maybe the expectations aren't excessive.\n\nThe son's response seems dismissive. He uses an excuse about organizing his room instead of doing the dishes. The parent is frustrated because they've already covered many costs, including the dresser, and the son's attitude might be contributing to the tension. The son's comment about the parent feeling like they \"own him\" suggests deeper resentment or misunderstanding about the parent's intentions. That could be a problem, as the parent is likely trying to support their child, not control them.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are adults, but they're in a transitional phase. The daughter is in college, the son about to start a job. They might not be used to contributing to chores since they were at home, or maybe they were younger when they left. However, being adults means they should take responsibility for their share. The parent's request isn't unreasonable, and expecting some gratitude or effort in return for the financial support is natural. \n\nBut maybe the parent's reaction was too harsh. Yelling might not be the best approach. Instead of expressing anger, discussing expectations calmly could have been better. Also, the parent might be overextending themselves by trying to cover so many costs while working long hours. This could lead to stress and frustration, which is understandable. However, the core issue is whether expecting help with chores is unreasonable. Since the kids are living under the same roof and the parent is working extensively, it's fair to ask for some help. The parent isn't in the wrong here; the children's lack of contribution and the son's dismissive attitude are the main issues. The son's resentment about feeling controlled needs to be addressed, but the parent's request for help is valid.\n"
