On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The author provides context: their kids moved back home, they pay for utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give them money for fun. The kids aren't working (one is in college, the other starting soon), and the parents work over 50 hours each. The author got angry when the son didn't do the dishes, even though he had a new dresser and was living out of a suitcase.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of mutual responsibility. The parents are providing financial support, but the children aren't contributing in other ways. The author is frustrated because they feel their contributions aren't being appreciated through household chores.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they aren't a clean freak and the house is lived-in. The son had been living out of a suitcase for three months, which might mean he's been adjusting to a new environment. The author's outburst about the cousin outing could imply they're using the money spent as a reason for the child to help, which might be seen as expecting repayment for expenses.\n\nThe son's comment that the author pays to feel like they own him is a strong statement. It suggests a possible underlying issue of control or resentment on the son's part. However, the author is asking if they're wrong for expecting help. \n\nIn terms of fairness, adult children living at home often are expected to contribute to household chores, especially when the parents are working long hours. The author's frustration is understandable, but yelling and bringing up past expenses to guilt-trip the children might be counterproductive. It could create more tension rather than foster a cooperative environment.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and clear expectations. The author might be right in wanting help, but the approach\u2014yelling and implying that their financial support is a debt\u2014could be problematic. It's possible the author is in the right to expect help, but the manner in which they expressed it might be where they're in the wrong. Alternatively, if the expectations were never clearly communicated, the author might share some responsibility for not setting those boundaries from the start.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be nuanced. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. The author's frustration is valid, but their response might have been excessive. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) due to the way they expressed their expectations rather than the expectation itself being wrong.\n"
