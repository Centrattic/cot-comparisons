On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores. The author provides context: their kids moved back home, they pay for everything including house, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. Both kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starts soon. The author works long hours and asks them to help around the house. When the son didn't do the dishes and made excuses, the author yelled and brought up the money they spent on the cousin's outing. The son interprets the money as the author trying to feel like they own him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's expectations are reasonable. The kids are adults, so it's fair to expect them to contribute to household chores. However, the author is paying for everything and might be using money as a way to feel like they're helping the kids, but the kids perceive it as control. The author's reaction (yelling) might be seen as harsh, especially bringing up past expenses. The son's response about feeling owned is a sign of tension and possible resentment.\n\nThe key points here are: the kids are adults, the author is covering all expenses, the author is working long hours, and there's a conflict over chores. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it could be problematic. Expecting appreciation through chores is reasonable, but the approach of yelling and using guilt-tripping by mentioning past expenses might not be fair. The son's comment indicates that the dynamic is causing issues in their relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong because they're projecting their expectations onto the kids without considering the kids' perspectives. The author's actions could come off as controlling, even if their intentions are good. However, it's also valid for parents to want their adult children to contribute to chores when they live together. The line between reasonable expectation and being overbearing is thin here. The author's use of guilt and yelling tips the balance towards being in the wrong. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
