On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.

Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for their expenses. The author has two adult kids who moved back in, neither has a job yet (one is starting soon, another is in college). The author works long hours and is frustrated when the kids don't help with chores. They got angry after the son prioritized setting up his room over doing dishes, even though they had paid for fun activities for the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so there's a line between parental responsibility and adult independence. The author is paying for their housing, food, utilities, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. They're working a lot, so expecting help is reasonable. But the kids are in a transitional phase\u2014college and job starting soon. It might be tough for them to adjust to contributing at the same time as managing their own schedules.\n\nThe author's outburst about the kids taking their cousin out and then not helping could come off as guilt-tripping. The son's comment about the author trying to \"own\" him suggests that the author's comments might be perceived as controlling or manipulative. Maybe the author's approach was too harsh, using the money spent as leverage for chores.\n\nBut also, it's fair for parents to expect some help in exchange for financial support, especially when they're working long hours. The balance here is tricky. The author isn't a clean freak, so the expectations aren't unreasonable. However, the way the author expressed their frustration might have been inconsiderate, especially if the kids are under stress from their own situations.\n\nI think the key points are: Are the expectations reasonable? Yes. Was the method of enforcing them appropriate? Maybe not. The author might be in the right in expecting help, but the way they handled it (yelling, bringing up previous expenses) could be seen as the wrong approach. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but with a caveat about communication style.\n"
