On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each. They asked the kids to help with chores, and the son was unresponsive, leading to the mother yelling about showing appreciation.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: adult children, being taken care of financially, and expecting some help in return. The parent feels they're being taken advantage of. The son's response about the parent feeling like they \"own him\" might be a red flag. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, once kids are adults, they might be expected to contribute, especially if they're living at home. The parents are clearly providing a lot, so it's reasonable to ask for help. However, the kids aren't working, which might affect their ability to contribute. The parent's tone when they yelled could be seen as harsh, but the underlying expectation isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe son's comment about the parent feeling ownership might be a bit manipulative, using guilt to avoid responsibility. The parent's frustration is valid because they're working long hours and managing a household. The daughter might also be affected but hasn't spoken up yet. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong for expecting help. It's a fair expectation when you're supporting someone. The issue might be communication or the kids not taking it seriously. But the parent has a right to ask for basic chores in exchange for the support they're providing. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
