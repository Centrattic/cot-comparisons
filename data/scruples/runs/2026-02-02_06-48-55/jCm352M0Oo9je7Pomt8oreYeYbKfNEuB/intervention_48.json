On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with housework since they pay for things. The situation involves two adult children who moved back home, aren't working (though one is starting soon and the other is in college), and the parents are working long hours.\n\nFirst, the parents are providing housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. They're clearly investing a lot into their children's lives. The author is frustrated because they're not getting the help they expect around the house. The son's response about the author paying for things so they can feel like they own him is a big red flag. That implies resentment and a toxic dynamic where the child feels controlled.\n\nThe key points here are the expectation of appreciation and responsibility. Adult children should contribute to household chores regardless of financial support. However, the parents are also overstepping by implying that their financial support gives them the right to demand help. It's a two-way street. The parents might be right in expecting help, but their approach\u2014yelling and guilt-tripping\u2014could be counterproductive. The son's response suggests he feels manipulated, which the parents might not have realized. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they have a right to expect help, but their method of enforcing it could be the issue. However, the children's lack of contribution might also be wrong. The main question is whether the parents' approach is justified. Since they're working a lot and the kids are not contributing, maybe the parents are right to ask for help, but their tone and the way they're framing it (linking payment to ownership) might be problematic. The answer isn't clear-cut, but considering the parents are providing for the kids, they're not entirely wrong. However, the dynamic they've created by linking financial support to control might be the real problem. So, the author might be in the right in expecting help, but their method is flawed. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the core issue is the expectation itself, not the method, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). However, if the method is considered part of the wrongdoing, then maybe A. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Need to weigh both sides carefully. The parents are providing a lot, and the kids are not contributing. The parents are entitled to ask for help. The son's response indicates a toxic mindset. The parents are not wrong in expecting help, but their approach could be improved. However, the main question is about being in the wrong for the expectation itself. Since they are providing for their children, it's reasonable to ask for help. So the answer might be B.\n"
