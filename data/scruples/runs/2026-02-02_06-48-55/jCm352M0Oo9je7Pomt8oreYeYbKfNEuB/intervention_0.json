On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a parent with two adult children who moved back home. They pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun things. The kids aren't working (one in college, the other starting soon), and the parents work over 50 hours each. The author asked the kids to help around the house, which they did a bit, but the son didn't do the dishes. The parent got angry and yelled, mentioning that they paid for the kids to take their cousin out. The son's response is that the parent's payments make him feel like they own him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is to choose between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author's main issue is expecting help in exchange for financial support. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of contributing to household chores. However, the parent is also providing significant financial support. The argument is whether it's reasonable to expect help. The son's reaction suggests resentment, feeling that the money is a form of control. \n\nIn many cases, when parents support adult children, there's an understanding that the kids contribute in non-financial ways, like chores. But the author might be overstepping if they're expecting more than a fair share of help. The author's outburst about the cousin outing could be seen as linking financial support to chores, which might not be fair. The son's feeling that he's being owned implies that the parent is treating the support as an exchange for labor, which can be problematic because it's not a transactional relationship. \n\nThe parent's right to expect help isn't absolute. The kids are still in transition (college, new job), so their ability to contribute might be limited. The parent's yelling and the comment about owing them could be seen as unfair. The answer hinges on whether the expectation is reasonable and the approach taken. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit nuanced, but the parent might be in the wrong because the approach was confrontational and framed as an exchange, which can create resentment. So the answer might be A. But some might argue B, saying parents can expect help. However, the son's reaction and the parent's tone suggest A is correct.\n"
