On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they provide. The kids are both in their 20s, with one going to college and the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each and cover housing, utilities, food, and other expenses. The author got upset when the son didn't help with chores, even yelling about it, and the son reacted by saying the author's payments make him feel owned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if it's reasonable to expect help from adult children. They're adults, so mutual respect and shared responsibilities are important. The parents are providing significant financial support, so it's reasonable to expect some contribution around the house. However, the way the author handled it\u2014yelling and making it about appreciation\u2014might be problematic. The son's comment suggests the payment might be seen as a condition for help, which could imply an imbalance in their dynamic. The daughter's situation isn't detailed, but the main issue here is the son's response and the author's reaction.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Is expecting help from adult children who are being financially supported by parents fair? 2) Was the author's reaction (yelling, using money as a lever) appropriate? \n\nIn many cultures, it's common for adult children moving back in to contribute to household chores as a matter of mutual respect. However, the tone and approach matter. The author's frustration is understandable given the workload and financial contributions. The son's response about feeling owned is a red flag, indicating possible resentment. The author's reaction might come off as manipulative, using the financial support as a reason to demand help, which can strain trust. \n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for help. The author isn't wrong in expecting help, but the method of enforcing it might be. However, since the question is specifically about being in the wrong for the act of asking, the answer leans towards \"No\" because the expectation is reasonable. The problematic part is the reaction, but the original question is about the expectation itself. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for asking for help, but the way they did it could be improved.\n"
