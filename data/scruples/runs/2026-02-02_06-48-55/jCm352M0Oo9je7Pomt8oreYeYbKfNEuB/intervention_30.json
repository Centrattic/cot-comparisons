On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a scenario where a parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for various things. The kids moved back home, the parents are working long hours, and the kids aren't working (except one starts soon). The parent got upset when the son didn't do dishes and made a comment about money and appreciation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent is providing financial support, including housing, utilities, food, and extra money for fun things like gas, insurance, and even taking the cousin out. The kids aren't working, but one is in college. The parent is asking for help with chores, which they consider reasonable, but the son reacts defensively, saying the parent pays to own him. The parent then yells about the kids not showing appreciation after spending money on them.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. Are parents obligated to provide for their adult children without expecting any help? Or is it reasonable to expect some reciprocation? The parent is working a lot and might be stressed, so their frustration is understandable. However, the way they addressed the situation\u2014yelling and making the son feel guilty\u2014might be problematic. The son's comment about the parent paying to own him suggests that there's a communication issue or perhaps resentment from the son's side.\n\nThe parent's main point is that since they pay for things, the kids should help. But the son's reaction indicates that he might feel taken advantage of, or maybe he doesn't see the connection between financial support and chores. The parent might be conflating financial support with emotional or behavioral expectations. Also, the fact that the son was just given a dresser and is settling in might be a factor\u2014perhaps he's not yet settled enough to take on chores.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, once children are adults, the expectations can shift. Parents might still want help, but it's important to communicate clearly and respectfully. Yelling and guilt-tripping might not be effective and could damage the relationship. The parent might be in the right in expecting some help, but the approach is wrong. Alternatively, if the parent is setting clear expectations from the start, that's different. However, the parent here seems to have asked for help a few times, and the kids did some things, but then the parent escalated when the son didn't comply with a specific chore.\n\nAnother angle: the son is in a transition period (just moved in, setting up his room), so maybe his priorities are different temporarily. The parent might not be considering that. Also, the comment about the parent paying to own him is a strong accusation, which the parent might have provoked by their own guilt-trip. The parent's reasoning about appreciation might be valid, but the way they expressed it could be seen as manipulative or controlling.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's intentions might be reasonable (expecting help when contributing financially), but their communication and emotional response could be where they're in the wrong. The son's reaction might stem from feeling pressured or misunderstood. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way they handled the situation rather than the expectation itself.\n"
