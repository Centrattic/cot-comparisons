On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for them. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, and they're not working but one is in college. The parents work long hours and have given them money for fun, gas, insurance, etc. The author asks them to help with chores, and when they don't, they got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're providing financial support, so it's reasonable for them to expect some help in return. After all, running a household involves work, and if the kids are living there, contributing to chores is fair. The parents aren't asking for perfection, just some help. The son's response about the parents owning him seems like a deflection. It's a bit extreme to think that payment equates to ownership, especially since the parents are doing it out of support, not to control.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are adults. They might feel that since they're being supported, they don't owe any chores. But in most families, especially with shared living spaces, some level of responsibility is expected. The parents aren't being unreasonable by asking for basic help. The son's behavior, ignoring the request and making excuses, isn't respectful. The author's frustration is valid because they're working hard and want to maintain their home. Yelling might not be the best approach, but the expectation itself isn't wrong.\n\nAlso, the kids have been moving back in and setting up their rooms. It's not like they're staying for free; the parents have made investments in their comfort. The author's request for appreciation through chores is reasonable. The son's accusation that the parents feel they own him is a misinterpretation. The parents are looking for mutual respect and shared responsibility, which is a normal expectation in any household. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary.\n"
