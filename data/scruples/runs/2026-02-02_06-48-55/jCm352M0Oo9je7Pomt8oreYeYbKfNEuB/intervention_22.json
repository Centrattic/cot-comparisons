On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for various things. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children, 21 and 20, who moved back home. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asked the kids to help with chores, and when they didn't do enough, the author got angry, especially when the son prioritized setting up his new dresser over doing the dishes. The son's response suggested he felt the author's payments were controlling.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is providing significant financial support, which is not uncommon for parents with adult children, especially during transitions like college or starting jobs. However, the key issue is whether the expectation of help around the house is reasonable. \n\nAdult children, even if they're still in college, are adults and might have different perspectives on responsibilities. The author expects help in exchange for financial support, which could be seen as reasonable in a shared living situation. But the son's comment about the author feeling like they \"own\" him suggests that there's a perception of control or manipulation, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given the workload and the lack of reciprocation. But yelling and implying that monetary support gives them the right to control the kids' actions might be overstepping. The children might feel that they're not being asked as equals but rather being coerced. \n\nAdditionally, the author's argument is based on gratitude for the financial support, but the children might not see helping with chores as a form of showing appreciation. They might feel that the financial support is their right as parents, and the chores should be a separate matter. \n\nAnother angle is the living situation. If the family lives together, it's reasonable to expect shared responsibilities. However, the author's approach in this case\u2014yelling and making it about the money they spent\u2014might not be the healthiest way to communicate expectations. A more collaborative approach, setting clear expectations without tying it to financial contributions, could be better.\n\nIn summary, while the author's expectations aren't entirely unreasonable, the way they expressed them and the underlying assumption that money entitles them to control the children's behavior could be problematic. The children's reactions might stem from feeling controlled rather than a lack of appreciation. So, the author might be partly in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their desire for help is valid.\n"
