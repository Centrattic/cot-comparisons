On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who's paying for their adult children's expenses and expecting them to help around the house. The parent feels they're being unappreciative when the kids don't help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent is covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even discretionary spending for their adult children. Both kids are back home, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work long hours. The parent feels they're being taken advantage of when the kids don't help with chores. The son's response about the parent trying to feel like they own him is a point to consider.\n\nNow, the parent yells and expresses frustration about the kids not showing appreciation. The key question is whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting help in exchange for financial support. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that family members contribute to household chores, even if they're not getting paid. However, the parent is providing financial support, so there might be an unspoken agreement about responsibilities. The parent might feel it's fair to ask for help, but the way they expressed it\u2014yelling and implying that financial support entitles them to help\u2014could be seen as manipulative or controlling. The son's reaction suggests he feels the parent is using money to gain control, which might be a valid perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is working long hours and covering all the expenses. It's reasonable to ask for some reciprocation in terms of household chores. However, the parent's approach might be too confrontational. Instead of yelling, setting clear expectations and discussing responsibilities could be more effective. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the expectations were set from the beginning and the kids are not meeting them without discussion, the parent might have a valid point. But if the parent hasn't clearly communicated these expectations and is now using financial contributions as leverage, that could be problematic. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it might be where the issue lies. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent might not be entirely wrong in expecting help, but their approach and the way they framed their request (using the money as a reason) could be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because they are using financial support as a means to control the kids' behavior, which isn't healthy. Alternatively, if the parent's expectations are reasonable and the kids are not contributing despite being able to, then the parent isn't wrong (B). But given the son's response about ownership, the parent's method is likely problematic. So, the answer might be A.\n"
