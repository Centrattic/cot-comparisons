But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support. The situation involves two adult kids who moved back home, aren't working (though one is starting soon and the other is in college), and the parents are working long hours. The author pays for their housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even gives them money for fun things. When the kids didn't help with chores, the author got upset and yelled, leading to the son's defensive comment about the author feeling like they own him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of adult children versus the parents' role. Typically, once someone is an adult, the expectation is that they contribute to the household where they live, especially if they're receiving financial support. However, the parents are providing a lot more than just a place to stay. They're covering multiple expenses, which might imply an expectation of help.\n\nThe author mentions they aren't a clean freak and have a lived-in home, so maybe the requests aren't excessive. The kids did help a bit, but not enough, leading to frustration. The author's reaction was yelling, which might not be the best approach. But the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help in return for financial support.\n\nThe son's comment that the author pays to feel like they own him is a red flag. That suggests the author's approach might be perceived as controlling or manipulative. However, it's also possible that the author's intent is genuine\u2014wanting the kids to contribute and show appreciation. The problem might be in the delivery or the underlying assumptions.\n\nIn many cases, parents might expect help from their adult children, but if it's framed as a transaction (you pay, so you own me), that's a problem. The author's yelling could exacerbate the situation. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting some help, especially since they're providing significant support. The question is whether the expectations are reasonable and the approach is fair.\n\nAnother angle: Are the kids contributing in other ways? The son is in college, which is a valid reason for not working, but he's been there for a while. The daughter hasn't started work yet. If they're not contributing financially or with chores, the parents might feel entitled to some help. But the author's reaction of yelling and bringing up the cousin outing might be seen as guilt-tripping, which isn't healthy. However, the core issue of expecting help isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the author's position is that they pay for things, so help should be given. The kids feel it's transactional. The author might be in the right to want help, but their method of expressing it is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the expectation is reasonable, maybe they aren't. But if the approach is controlling, maybe they are.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and family dynamics. In some families, it's expected that children contribute when they live at home, regardless of age. In others, once children are adults, they're seen as independent. The author's situation is a mix of both. They're providing substantial support and expecting some help, which is common, but the son's reaction indicates that the expectation might be seen as overstepping. The author's yell and the mention of the cousin outing as a guilt-trip might not be appropriate, but the underlying expectation isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because it's reasonable to expect some help when providing such support. However, the approach could be improved. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So, the author isn't in the wrong for having the expectation, but maybe the execution is flawed. So the answer is B.\n"
