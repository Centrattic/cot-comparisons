He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their adult children, who live at home and are supported financially, to help with household chores. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, both kids moved back home in the last year. The parents are paying for the house, utilities, food, plus giving money for fun, gas, and insurance. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The children aren't working yet, one is in school. The user asked them to help around the house, and they did some things. The user isn't a clean freak, the house is just lived-in. \n\nThen the son was asked to do the dishes, but he was busy setting up his new dresser (since he moved in 3 months ago and was living out of a suitcase). The parent got angry and mentioned paying for the kids taking their cousin out, implying they should be grateful and help. The son responds that the parent's payments make him feel owned. The question is, is the parent wrong for expecting help in exchange for the financial support?\n\nHmm. The key points here are the expectations of adult children living at home. The parents are providing significant financial support, which is common when kids move back in, especially if they're in transition (college, job starting). However, the parents expect chores in return. The children are contributing in some way, but maybe not as much as the parents want. The parent's reaction was yelling and bringing up the financial aspect as a reason for help. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong. They are providing a lot, and it's reasonable to expect some help with chores, especially if the parents are working so many hours. However, the way they expressed it\u2014yelling and making it a guilt trip\u2014might be problematic. The son's response about feeling owned suggests there's some control or resentment on the son's part. But the core expectation isn't unreasonable. The parent isn't asking for perfection, just some contribution. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but maybe with a note about communication style.\n"
