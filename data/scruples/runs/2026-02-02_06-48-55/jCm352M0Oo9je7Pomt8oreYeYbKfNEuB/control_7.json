On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for the house, utilities, food, and even fun things, gas, insurance. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starts soon. The parents work 50+ hours each. The author asked the kids to help around the house, and when they didn't, the author got angry and yelled, bringing up the money spent, like taking their cousin out.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the situation. First, the parents are providing a lot of financial support. The kids are adults but not contributing, which is a common issue when adult children move back in. The parents are working a lot, so they're probably stressed. The son's response about the parents paying to \"own him\" is a sensitive point. The author's reaction was yelling and bringing up past expenses, which might be seen as manipulative or unfair. \n\nBut the parents are asking for reasonable help around the house. The kids did do a couple of things, but maybe not enough. The author isn't a clean freak, so the expectations are moderate. The key here is whether the parents are wrong for expecting help given their financial contributions. On one hand, it's fair to expect some reciprocity. On the other, the kids are adults and might feel they aren't obligated to help if they're not being paid. The son's comment about feeling owned could indicate resentment, which the parents' approach might be exacerbating. \n\nThe author's question is if they're in the wrong for asking for appreciation through chores. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. However, the parents are justified in expecting some help, but their reaction (yelling and using money as leverage) might be counterproductive. But the core question is about being in the wrong for the expectation itself. So the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help, but their approach might be questionable. But the question is about the expectation, not the method. So the answer should be B.\n"
