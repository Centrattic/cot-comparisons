Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children, 21 and 20 years old, who moved back home. The parents are paying for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun activities. They work long hours, over 50 each week. The kids aren't employed, though one is in college and the other is starting a job soon. The author is asking them to help with chores, like doing dishes, and got upset when they didn't do it immediately. The son mentioned that since the parents pay for things, the parents feel they own him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's fair for the author to expect help in exchange for financial support. Let me break this down.\n\nIn many cultures, contributing to household chores is considered part of living in a shared space, especially when you're contributing financially. The parents are clearly providing a lot of support, and it's reasonable to expect some reciprocal help, especially since the kids are adults. However, the parents also mention that they aren't clean freaks and the house is \"very lived in,\" which might mean they don't expect perfection. But the fact remains that they're asking for basic help.\n\nThe son's response about the parents feeling they own him is a bit extreme. It suggests that he might be resistant to any expectations of responsibility, which could be a problem. The author's frustration is understandable given their workload and the financial commitment. They're trying to balance their jobs and family life, and the lack of help from the kids could be causing stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids might be in a transition phase. The son is starting a job soon, and the daughter is in college. They might be adjusting to moving back home and not used to household responsibilities. It's possible they're overwhelmed or not aware of the expectations. The parents could benefit from setting clear expectations and discussing their needs calmly rather than getting angry. But that doesn't mean the author is wrong for wanting help in return for their support.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't wrong. They're justified in expecting some contribution, especially since they're providing substantial support. The issue might be more about communication and setting clear boundaries rather than the author being in the wrong.\n"
