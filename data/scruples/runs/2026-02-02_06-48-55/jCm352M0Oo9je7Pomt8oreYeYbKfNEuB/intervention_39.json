He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, neither has a job yet (one is starting next week, the other is in college), and they're given money for fun stuff, gas, insurance. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author is frustrated when the kids don't help with chores, leading to a yelling incident where the son was defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of contributing to household responsibilities. However, the parents are providing significant financial support, which might be seen as a trade-off. The son's response that the parents pay to \"feel like they own him\" suggests resentment, which could be a red flag for control issues.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they're working hard and expecting some reciprocity. But the way they handled the situation\u2014yelling and bringing up the cousin outing\u2014might be counterproductive. It's possible that the author's approach is what's causing the resentment. The kids might feel pressured or unappreciated despite the support.\n\nAlso, the fact that the son was moving out of a suitcase for three months and just got a dresser implies that the parents are trying to make his stay easier. If he's in the process of settling in, maybe his focus is on organizing his space, which isn't unreasonable. However, the author's need for help with dinner is a basic household task. The key issue is whether the author's expectations are reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nAdult children in such situations are often expected to contribute, especially if they're not contributing financially. But the method of enforcing this is important. The author's outburst and the comment about the outing might come off as shaming, which could harm the relationship. It's possible that the author is in the right in expecting help but wrong in how they communicated it. Alternatively, the kids might be in the right if the expectations weren't clearly set from the start.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' workload. Working 50+ hours each week is a lot, so having help with chores makes sense. However, the kids might have other priorities or stressors, like starting college or a new job. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests that the financial support is perceived as a form of control rather than genuine support, which could be a deeper issue.\n\nIn summary, the author's request for help isn't inherently wrong, but the approach taken\u2014yelling and implying guilt\u2014might be. The core issue is mutual understanding and setting clear expectations without creating resentment. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family dynamics, but generally, expecting some contribution from adult children in exchange for financial support is reasonable. However, the method of enforcement matters. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
