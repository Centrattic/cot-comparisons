On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things like housing, utilities, food, gas, and entertainment. The kids are adults, one in college, the other starting soon, and both moved back home. The author works long hours and feels entitled to some help with chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms around adult children and household responsibilities. Generally, when adult children live at home, especially if they're still in school or job hunting, parents expect some level of contribution. It's not just about money; it's about shared responsibility. The author is providing a lot of financial support, which could imply an expectation of reciprocal effort in maintaining the home.\n\nThe author's frustration comes from feeling that their contributions aren't being acknowledged. The son's response about the author \"owning him\" suggests a possible conflict in their dynamics. The author's reaction\u2014yelling after asking for help\u2014is a point of concern. While it's reasonable to expect help, the manner in which it's demanded can affect perceptions of right or wrong.\n\nHowever, the author isn't a clean freak and describes the home as \"very lived in,\" so their standards might be reasonable. The children's lack of employment might mean they aren't in a position to contribute financially, so helping with chores is a way to share the load.\n\nThe key here is balance. The author's request isn't unreasonable, but the way they expressed it (yelling) might be. The son's defensive attitude could stem from feeling resentful about the financial contributions. The author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting help, but they might need to approach the situation with more communication and understanding, rather than guilt-tripping or yelling. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they could improve their approach.\n"
