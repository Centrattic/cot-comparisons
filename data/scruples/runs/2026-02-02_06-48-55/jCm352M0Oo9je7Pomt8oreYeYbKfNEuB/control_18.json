On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they're providing.\n\nFirst, the parent is paying for their 21-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter's housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. Both kids moved back home in the last year. The son is in college, and the daughter will start a job soon. The parent works 50+ hours a week, and the husband does too. They've asked the kids to help with chores, and the kids did a bit. The parent isn't a clean freak, but they want some help. \n\nThe key issue is whether the parent is wrong for asking for appreciation through helping out. The son's response was that he's focusing on setting up his room after living out of a suitcase for three months. The parent got angry and mentioned the money spent on the cousin's outing, and the son accuses the parent of trying to control him through paying.\n\nI need to consider societal norms. Parents often expect some responsibility from adult children, especially when they're receiving financial support. However, the line between support and obligation can be blurry. The parent isn't being unreasonable in wanting help; after all, maintaining a household is a shared responsibility. The kids are adults, so expecting them to contribute is fair. However, the parent's reaction might have been harsh. Yelling and confronting the son with past expenses could be seen as overreacting. \n\nThe son's comment about the parent trying to own him with money is a red flag. It suggests there might be underlying issues in their relationship. The parent's approach should probably be more about setting clear expectations rather than using guilt or past expenditures as leverage. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent isn't wrong for wanting help. But the way they expressed it might be problematic. The answer here is likely B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong because expecting some help is reasonable, but the method could be improved. However, the main question is whether they're in the wrong, not the method. So the answer is B.\n"
