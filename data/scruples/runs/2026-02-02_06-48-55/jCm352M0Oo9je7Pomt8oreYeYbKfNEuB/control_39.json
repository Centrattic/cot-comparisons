But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The scenario is that the children moved back home, the parents work long hours, and the kids aren't contributing as much as the parents would like.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are providing housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun activities, gas, and insurance. The kids are 21 and 20, so they're adults. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents are working over 50 hours each week. They've asked the kids to help with chores, and the kids have done some, but not enough. The son's response about setting up his new dresser and the daughter's cousin outing where they spent money led the parent to yell about expecting appreciation.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's expectations versus the kids' contributions. Since the kids are adults, the parent might reasonably expect some responsibility in exchange for the support provided. However, the parent is also working a lot and might be feeling overburdened. The son's comment about the parent feeling like they own him is a red flag, indicating possible resentment or a strained relationship. The parent's reaction of yelling could be seen as harsh, but the context might justify it as frustration from being overworked and underappreciated.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people expect adult children living at home to contribute to household chores, especially when the parents are working long hours. The parent isn't asking for excessive cleanliness but just basic help. The kids aren't working yet, one is in school, which might affect their ability to contribute equally, but some level of contribution is reasonable.\n\nThe parent's demand for appreciation might be a bit much, but given the financial support provided, it's understandable. The problem might be that the parent is not setting clear boundaries or expectations, leading to confusion. The yelling incident suggests that communication is breaking down, but the core issue is about mutual respect and shared responsibility.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to expect some help in exchange for their support. However, the way they handled the situation (yelling) might be problematic. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for the expectation itself. Since the parent is providing significant support, expecting some household contributions is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
