On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house, given that they pay for their expenses. The situation involves two adult kids who moved back home, aren't working yet (one is in college, the other starts a job soon), and the parents work long hours. The author gave a dresser to the son to help organize his clothes after living out of a suitcase for three months. They got angry when the son prioritized setting up his room over doing the dishes, and mentioned paying for their expenses as feeling like ownership.\n\nFirst, the parents are providing significant financial support: housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and money for fun. They also work 50+ hours a week, which is a lot. They\u2019re asking for help with basic chores. The kids are adults, so expectations might be different than when they were minors. The son's response about the author feeling like they own him is important. The user's anger and yelling might be seen as overreacting, especially if the kids aren't obligated to help. However, the parents are also providing resources, so expecting some reciprocity isn't unreasonable. The key here is whether the expectation is fair. Since the kids are adults, they have a choice in helping, but the parents can reasonably expect some contribution, especially if it's a shared living space. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of expressing it (yelling) might not be the best approach. However, the core issue is about fairness in expectations. The son's comment about ownership is a red flag, indicating possible resentment, but the parents' request for help isn't inherently wrong. So, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong, but their reaction could be improved. The answer is B (No).\n"
