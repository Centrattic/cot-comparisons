On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they're paying for things. The situation is that the kids moved back home, the parents are working long hours, and the kids aren't helping with chores. The parents give money for fun things, gas, insurance, etc. The kids are 21 and 20, with one in college and the other starting soon. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are providing financial support, which might be expected in some families, but when it comes to household responsibilities, there's a conflict. The kids aren't working, but one is in school. The parent feels they're entitled to help because of the financial contributions. The son's response about the parent feeling like they own him is a bit harsh, but maybe he's feeling pressured.\n\nIs it reasonable for the parent to ask for help? Well, in many cultures, adults are expected to contribute to the household where they live, especially if they're living under someone else's roof. The parents are working a lot, so it's reasonable they'd need help with chores. However, the parent might be mixing up financial support with emotional or labor contributions. The fact that the son is moving in and setting up his room might be a point\u2014maybe he's still adjusting. \n\nThe parent's reaction of yelling and bringing up the money spent on the cousin outing could come off as manipulative or guilt-tripping. The son's comment suggests he feels controlled, which the parent might not realize. Maybe the parent's approach isn't the best, but the expectation itself isn't unreasonable. The key is whether expecting help in exchange for financial support is fair. Since the kids are living at home, contributing to chores is a basic courtesy. However, the way the parent is enforcing it might be part of the problem. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If they're expecting help because they pay for things, that could be seen as transactional. But in a family setting, some things are just part of living in a home together. The parent might not be in the wrong for expecting help, but their method of communication (yelling, using money as leverage) might be where they're wrong. The answer could be B (No), but with the nuance that the approach is problematic.\n"
