On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for things. The situation is that the adult kids moved back home, the parents are covering rent, utilities, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun stuff. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours, and the kids aren't helping with chores. The author yells at their son for not doing dishes after paying for them to do something nice.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the expectations. The author believes that since they're providing financial support, the kids should help out. The kids, however, don't seem to feel obligated. The son's response about the author paying to feel like they own him is a red flag. That suggests there might be some resentment or a history of issues where the author's support is being seen as control rather than genuine help.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. One is the dynamic between parents and adult children. Adult children are adults, so it's reasonable to expect them to contribute to household chores, regardless of financial support. However, the approach the author took\u2014yelling and making the kids feel guilty\u2014might be problematic. The author is trying to enforce a sense of appreciation through financial contributions, which could be seen as using money as leverage. That could backfire, especially if the kids feel forced into helping rather than doing it from a place of gratitude.\n\nAlso, the son's comment about the author feeling they own him implies that the author's motivations might be mixed. If the author is paying for things to assert control or feel needed, that could be an issue. Healthy relationships should be based on mutual respect, not financial obligation. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of expressing that frustration (yelling) isn't constructive. Instead of yelling, maybe setting clear expectations and discussing roles in the household would be better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing a lot of support, and it's reasonable to expect some form of contribution in return, especially in a shared living space. The problem might not be the author's request itself but how it's being communicated and the underlying dynamics. The author might need to check their own motivations and the way they express their needs rather than being in the wrong entirely.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting help around the house, but the approach and the possible underlying issues (like using money as a tool for control) could be problematic. The key here is the method of communication and the children's perception of the support. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help, but they might need to adjust their approach.\n"
