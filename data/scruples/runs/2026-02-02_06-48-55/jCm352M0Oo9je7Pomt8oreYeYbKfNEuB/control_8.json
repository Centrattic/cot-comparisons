On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they're paying for things. The situation is that both kids moved back home, the parents are working a lot, and the kids aren't helping around the house. The parents are giving money for fun things, gas, insurance. One is in college, the other starting soon. They both don't have jobs yet.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parents are covering a lot of expenses, but the kids aren't contributing with chores. The parent got upset when the son didn't do the dishes despite the dresser being a new purchase. The son's attitude seems to be that because the parents pay for things, they \"own\" him, which is a negative view. The parent is frustrated and feels they're being taken for granted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent is asking for help in exchange for the financial support. Since the kids are adults, they should be expected to contribute to household chores, especially if they live at home and benefit from the household. The parent isn't a clean freak and just wants the house to be lived-in, not spotless. The parent is working long hours and trying to balance everything. The son's response implies that the parent's generosity is a form of control, which might be a toxic mindset. The parent's frustration is understandable given their contributions.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, it's common for adult children to help with chores when living at home, especially when the parents are covering their expenses. The parent is not wrong to set boundaries or expect some level of contribution. The son's attitude is problematic, but the parent's initial request is reasonable. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
