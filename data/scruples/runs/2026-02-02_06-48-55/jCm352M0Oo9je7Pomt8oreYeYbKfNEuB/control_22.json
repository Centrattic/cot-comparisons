On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things.\n\nFirst, the kids are adults, 21 and 20, and they've both moved back home. The parents are working over 50 hours each week and providing housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun, gas, and insurance. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents have asked them to help with chores, and when the son didn't do the dishes, the mom got upset and yelled, mentioning that they spent money on their cousin's outing.\n\nThe son's response about the parent feeling like they own him is a bit concerning. It might indicate some tension or resentment. But the parents are asking for appreciation through helping out. The key points here are expectations for adult children, the balance between support and contribution, and communication.\n\nIn many cases, even when parents provide financial support, there's an expectation of contributing to household chores, especially in a shared living situation. The parents aren't being unreasonable about the cleanliness, just asking for help. The son's attitude and the mom's frustration seem to be part of the problem. However, the mom's approach of yelling might not be the best method. But the core issue is whether expecting help is fair. Since the kids are adults, expecting some level of responsibility is reasonable. The parents aren't demanding perfection, just basic help. So the author isn't in the wrong for asking for appreciation through chores. The answer should be B.\n"
