On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with housework in exchange for financial support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The adult children, 21 and 20 years old, moved back home. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The parents work over 50 hours a week. The children aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other is starting work soon. The author asked them to help around the house, and the son responded by prioritizing setting up his room. The author got angry and mentioned the money spent on their cousin's outing, and the son accused the author of wanting to \"own him.\"\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. \n\nOn one hand, the parents are providing significant financial support, which isn't a small matter. It's reasonable for them to expect some contribution in return, especially with housework when it's a shared living space. The author isn't a clean freak, just a lived-in home, so the expectation isn't excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, the children are adults and might be adjusting or have other priorities. The son's response about the dresser might be valid if he's just moved in and hasn't had time to organize. However, after three months, expecting some basic help is fair. The father's comment about the money making the author feel like they own him is a bit strong and could be a sensitive point. \n\nThe parents' approach might be a problem. Yelling could be seen as an overreaction, especially if the children are under stress or dealing with their own issues (like being in college or starting a new job). It's important to communicate expectations calmly. Also, maybe the parents haven't clearly set boundaries or expectations when the kids moved back in. \n\nBut the core issue is whether it's reasonable to ask for help. The parents are working hard and paying for a lot. Adult children contributing to household chores is a common expectation. However, the way the author handled it\u2014yelling and bringing up the money\u2014might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong for expecting help, but the method of communication was poor. The son's comment about the parent's intent might be a deflection, but it's also possible the parents' emphasis on money is making the son feel controlled. \n\nIn summary, the expectation for help is reasonable (B), but the tone and approach could be improved. The answer leans towards B because the author isn't in the wrong for expecting appreciation and help, but could adjust how they express it.\n"
