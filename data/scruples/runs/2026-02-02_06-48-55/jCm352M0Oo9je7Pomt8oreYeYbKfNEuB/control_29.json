But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. So, first, let me break down the situation.\n\nThe parents have two adult kids, 21 and 20, who moved back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun stuff. Neither child has a job yet, but one is in college and the other is starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. They've asked the kids to help around the house, and the kids did some things. The author isn't a clean freak, just a lived-in home.\n\nThen there's the specific incident where the son didn't do the dishes and instead focused on organizing his new dresser. The author got upset and yelled about the kids taking the cousin out and not showing appreciation. The son also says the mom pays for things to feel like she owns him.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parents are providing a lot of financial support and expecting some help in return. That seems reasonable because it's a shared home; contributing to chores is normal. But the kids are adults and might have different perspectives, maybe feeling that the parents should just provide without expecting anything in return. The son's comment about ownership is a key point\u2014maybe there's some resentment or underlying issues here.\n\nThe author did yell, which might be seen as harsh, but they also mention they're not a clean freak. However, the kids are living at home and not working yet. It's a balance between parental expectations and adult children's autonomy. The parents are working long hours, so expecting some help to maintain the household seems fair.\n\nBut the kids might not have jobs, so maybe their ability to contribute is limited. However, chores aren't about income; they're about shared responsibility. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it (yelling) might have been inappropriate. Still, the core request for help isn't unreasonable.\n\nAlso, the son's response about the mom feeling ownership is a red flag. It suggests possible manipulation or a toxic dynamic. The author might need to address that without yelling. But the question is about being in the wrong for asking for help. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're seeking a reasonable exchange. However, their reaction could be improved. But the main issue is the expectation. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
