On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author has two adult children, 21 and 20, who moved back home. The parents are covering the house, utilities, food, some fun expenses, gas, and insurance. The kids aren't working yet\u2014only one is starting college and the other is going to start a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. \n\nThe author mentions that they asked the kids to clean up, which they did a bit, but not enough. Then there's the incident where the son was supposed to do the dishes but instead focused on organizing his new dresser. The author got angry and yelled about them taking the cousin out last night and expecting appreciation. The son also has a comment that the author's payments make him feel owned.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the expectation of help in exchange for financial support. The author is asking if they're at fault for this.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the kids are adults. Generally, adults are expected to contribute to household chores unless there's a specific reason they can't. The parents are providing financial support, which might be seen as a way to cover the kids' expenses while they're in transition (moving back home, starting college, getting a job). But expecting help around the house is reasonable. \n\nThe parents are working long hours, so it's understandable they'd feel overwhelmed. However, did they set clear expectations from the start? If they didn't establish roles and responsibilities when the kids moved back, maybe that's part of the problem. The author's reaction of yelling might have come from frustration, but maybe they didn't communicate their expectations properly upfront.\n\nThe son's comment that the author's payments make him feel owned is important. That suggests there's tension around the financial support. The son might feel pressured or resentful, which could explain why he's not helping as much. The author might be taking that the wrong way, interpreting it as the son not appreciating the help, but the son's perspective is different.\n\nThe daughter and son did help a little, but maybe not enough. The author's question is whether it's their fault for expecting help. I think the parents are in a tough spot, but the key is whether they're being unreasonable. They're providing significant financial support, but adults should contribute to basic household tasks. If the kids aren't doing that, even minimally, maybe the parents are right to expect it. However, the way the author expressed their frustration (yelling) and the context of their financial contributions might have caused the issue. \n\nAlso, considering that the kids are in a transitional phase, maybe the parents need to adjust their expectations. But since the parents are working so much, they might need help. It's a balance. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a right to expect some help, especially in an adult household. However, their approach (yelling, framing it as a debt of gratitude) might be problematic. The son's resentment is a red flag. The parents might need to communicate better and perhaps set clearer boundaries without making the kids feel like they owe something for every expense. \n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help. Since the kids are adults, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
