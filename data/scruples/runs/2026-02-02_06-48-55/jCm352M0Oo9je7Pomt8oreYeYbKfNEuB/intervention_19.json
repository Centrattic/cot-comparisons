On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for their expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has two adult children (21 and 20) who moved back home. They pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun activities. Both kids are currently not working, but one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asks the kids to help with chores, and when they don't do enough, the author gets upset and yells. The son's response is that he needs to organize his new dresser, and the author feels their argument is that the money given is to make them feel owned.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around adult children and responsibility. In many cultures, even when parents support their adult children, there's an expectation of contributing to household chores. However, the parents here are providing a lot, which might create a dynamic where the children feel entitled or the parents feel exploited.\n\nThe key points are: the parents are paying for everything, the kids are not working (though one is in college), and the author is asking for help. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests resentment. The author's reaction\u2014yelling\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if the kids are already in a stressful situation (moving back home, not working). \n\nBut on the other hand, the parents are working long hours and managing a lot. Their request for help is reasonable. The issue might be communication. The author's approach of yelling might be counterproductive, but the expectation itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is not in the wrong for expecting help. The problem might be in the delivery and the underlying dynamics. The author's frustration is understandable given the workload and expenses. However, the way they handled it could be improved. But the core expectation isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
