On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for expecting their adult children to help with housework since they pay for their expenses. \n\nFirst, the kids are adults, 21 and 20, and they moved back home. The parent is covering housing, utilities, food, plus giving money for fun things, gas, and insurance. The kids aren't working yet; one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parent works long hours and is asking for help with chores. \n\nThe son didn't do the dishes and instead made an excuse about organizing his room. The parent got angry and mentioned the money spent on the cousin outing. The son accuses the parent of trying to control him through payment.\n\nNow, considering the situation: Adult children often expect support from parents, especially when they're transitioning into adulthood. However, it's reasonable for parents to expect some level of contribution, especially if they're living in the same household. The parent is providing significant financial support, which can create a dynamic where chores are part of the arrangement. \n\nBut there's a line between reasonable expectations and being overly controlling. The parent isn't a clean freak, so the demands aren't unreasonable. The son's attitude and excuses might be the bigger issue here. The parent's frustration is understandable given the effort and cost involved in supporting their kids. \n\nThe key points are the adult children's lack of reciprocation and the parent's reasonable request for help. The parent isn't being unfair; they're asking for basic household contributions in exchange for the financial support they provide. The son's resentment and refusal without effort to help could make him more at fault. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
