Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house given that they pay for various expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Both adult children moved back home. The parents are paying for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The kids aren't working, though one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours. The mother asks them to help with chores, but when she yells at the son about not doing dishes after they spent money on a cousin, he reacts negatively, saying the payments make her feel like she owns him.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the parents are wrong to expect gratitude and help in return for their financial support. From a traditional perspective, parents often expect some form of contribution from adult children, especially when they're living at home and being supported. However, the children might feel that since they're being financially supported, they don't owe a reciprocal duty. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests resentment, which complicates things.\n\nBut the parents are asking for basic help around the house, which is reasonable. They're not demanding a lot, just cleaning up, dishes, etc. The mother is stressed from working a lot and trying to manage the household. The children's lack of contribution could be adding to the parents' stress. \n\nThe key points here are: the parents are providing significant financial support, the children are adults, and the expectation of basic household responsibilities is reasonable. The children's reaction, especially the son's, indicates a possible boundary or communication issue. The parents might not be in the wrong for expecting help, but their approach (yelling) might be problematic. However, the question is about being in the wrong for the expectation itself, not the yelling. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because it's reasonable to expect basic help in return for financial support. However, the way the mother handled it could be improved, but the underlying expectation isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
