On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for things.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children who moved back home. They cover housing, utilities, food, some fun expenses, gas, and insurance. The kids aren't working yet, but one is in college and the other is about to start a job. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asks for help around the house, but the kids only do a little. The author then yells at the son for not doing dishes, bringing up that they paid for a dinner outing for the kids and their cousin. The son responds that the author pays for things to feel like they own him.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the kids are adults, the parents are providing financial support, and the author expects chores in return. \n\nIn many cultures, adult children are expected to contribute to household chores even if they're not working, especially when the parents are providing financial support. However, the situation might be complicated by the kids' current situations (college, starting a job). The author's frustration is understandable given the workload, but yelling and using guilt (like mentioning the dinner outing) might be seen as unfair. The son's comment suggests he feels the author's payments are controlling, which could indicate underlying issues. \n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting help. The fact that the author is providing so much support might mean they have a right to expect some contributions. However, the approach taken (yelling, guilt-tripping) might be problematic. So, the author might not be in the wrong for expecting chores, but their method could be at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it's because they're using guilt and harsh reactions to enforce chores, which can be seen as manipulative. If not in the wrong, it's because they're reasonable to expect help when providing financial support. The answer depends on balancing expectations with the approach taken.\n"
