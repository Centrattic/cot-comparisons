On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with housework in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children, both in their early 20s. They moved back home, and the parents are covering housing, utilities, food, plus extra expenses like gas, insurance, and fun activities. The kids aren't working yet\u2014though one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours. \n\nThe author feels they're contributing financially and expects some help around the house. When they asked their son to do dishes, he was busy setting up his new dresser (he was living out of a suitcase for three months). The author got angry and yelled about the kids taking money to spend on their cousin and not showing appreciation. The son also says the author's payments make him feel owned, which adds to the tension.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are providing significant support, which is common for adult children in financial need. Expecting help with chores is reasonable. However, the author's reaction\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might be seen as harsh. The son was in the middle of setting up his new room, which is a transition period. The daughter is starting a job soon, which might indicate she could contribute more soon.\n\nThe key points are: the parents are overextending financially, the kids aren't working yet (though one is in school), and the author's approach might be too confrontational. But expecting help is fair. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests there's resentment, which the parents might need to address more constructively instead of yelling. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable given the workload. The answer isn't black and white, but the parent isn't entirely in the wrong. They're in a tough situation, but their method of communication could be better. The kids might need to step up, but the parent's approach needs adjustment. So, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they handle it.\n"
