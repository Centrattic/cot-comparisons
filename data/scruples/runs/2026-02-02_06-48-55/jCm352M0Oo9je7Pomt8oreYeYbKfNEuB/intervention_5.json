On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has two adult children who moved back home. They're paying for their housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun things. The kids aren't working, one is in college and the other is about to start. The parents work over 50 hours a week. The author is asking the kids to help with chores, and when they do a little, the author gets upset. The example given is the son refusing to do the dishes to set up his room instead. The author yelled about the kids taking the cousin out, implying they should show appreciation. The son claims the money makes the author feel like the parent owns him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author is providing a lot of financial support. They might expect some reciprocation through household chores. But are they overstepping? The kids are adults, so they have a right to their own space and time. The son was living out of a suitcase for three months, and getting a dresser is part of setting up his room. The author's reaction might be seen as unfair if the kids are trying to establish their independence. Also, the son's comment about the author feeling ownership suggests there's a history of control issues. \n\nThe author's yelling and bringing up the money might be too much. The kids aren't working, but one is in college, which can be time-consuming. The parent's frustration is understandable given their workload, but they need to consider the kids' perspectives. Adult children might need more autonomy. The author could be expecting too much help, especially if the household isn't excessively messy. \n\nOn the other hand, it's reasonable for parents to ask for some help in return for the support they provide. The key might be how it's communicated. Yelling and using guilt trips can be counterproductive. The author's approach might be too harsh, making them the one in the wrong. Alternatively, if the expectations are clear and reasonable, maybe not. But the son's comment about feeling owned implies the author's actions are controlling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the kids' autonomy and for reacting with anger instead of setting clear, calm expectations. The answer is likely A.\n"
