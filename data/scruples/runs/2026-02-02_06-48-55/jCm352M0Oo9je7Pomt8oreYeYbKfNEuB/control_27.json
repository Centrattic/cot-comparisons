On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for their expenses. The situation involves two adult kids who moved back home. The parents are working long hours, and the kids aren't working yet\u2014one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parent got upset because the son didn't help with dishes after paying for his and his sister's outing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The parents are providing a lot: housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and extra money for fun things. The kids aren't contributing monetarily. The parent is asking for basic chores in return. Is it reasonable to expect help? Well, in many households, especially when someone is living with others, contributing to chores is standard. The parent isn't a clean freak, so the expectation isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe son's response about the parent paying for things to \"own him\" is a bit defensive. Maybe he feels the parent is being controlling. But the parent's point is about fairness and appreciation. The parent is working hard and covering a lot of expenses, so expecting some help seems fair. The kids are adults, so they should be capable of contributing. However, the parent did yell, which might have been an overreaction. But the core issue is about mutual responsibility.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or situational factors. The kids are in a transitional phase, one in college, the other about to start a job. Maybe they're not used to balancing chores with their own responsibilities. But even then, basic household tasks are part of living in a shared space. The parent's anger might be justified because they're handling a lot and the kids aren't pulling their weight.\n\nThe key points: The author is providing significant financial support and expects basic help in return. The kids aren't contributing, leading to frustration. The author's reaction was a yell, which might be a problem, but the underlying request for help isn't. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are setting boundaries, which is reasonable when supporting adult children. The kids' behavior of not helping despite the support is the issue here.\n"
