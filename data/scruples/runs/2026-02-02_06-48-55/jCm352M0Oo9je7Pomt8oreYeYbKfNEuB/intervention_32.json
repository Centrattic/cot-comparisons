On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they cover various expenses. The scenario involves two adult kids who moved back home, neither has a job (though one is in college and the other starting soon), and the parents work over 50 hours each.\n\nThe author mentions providing housing, utilities, food, and additional money for fun activities, gas, and insurance. They're asking the kids to help with chores, and when they didn't do them adequately, the author got upset and yelled about expecting appreciation. The son's response was that the money makes the author feel like they own him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if it's reasonable to expect adult children to contribute to household chores. Since they're adults, even if they're moving back home temporarily, contributing to household duties is often expected. However, the parents are providing significant financial support, which might create an imbalance in expectations. The kids might feel that since they're being supported, they don't need to contribute as much, or they might not see the connection between receiving support and helping out.\n\nThe author's response of yelling and bringing up the money spent could be seen as manipulative or using financial contributions as leverage for chores. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests that the parents' approach might be coming from a place of needing control or validation rather than mutual respect. \n\nIt's possible that the author's expectations are reasonable, but the way they expressed them (yelling) and the framing of the chores as a form of repayment might be problematic. The kids might feel pressured rather than appreciated. Also, the author's frustration about the kids not helping could stem from their own stress from working long hours, which is understandable, but the response might not be the healthiest way to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to maintain a balance between supporting their children and expecting some reciprocation. The key point is whether their approach is fair. The author isn't asking for a clean house but for basic help, which is reasonable. However, the issue might be the emotional tone and the implication that financial support entitles them to unpaid labor, which could be seen as exploitative.\n\nIn summary, while expecting some help is reasonable, the author's methods and the way they framed the request might be where they're in the wrong. The answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because of the manipulative framing and the yelling, but if the help requested is reasonable, maybe B. However, considering the potential for resentment and the son's reaction, leaning towards A makes sense.\n"
