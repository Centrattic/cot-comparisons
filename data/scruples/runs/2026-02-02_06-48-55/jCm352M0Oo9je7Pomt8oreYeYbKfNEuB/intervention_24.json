On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even extra fun stuff. The kids aren't working yet; one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author feels they're doing a lot and wants the kids to help with chores. The son responded by saying the author's payments make him feel owned. The author yelled about the kids taking their cousin out last night after they were given money.\n\nHmm, so the key points are whether it's reasonable to expect adult children to contribute to household chores when they're living at home and the parents are covering most costs. The kids are adults, but they're still in a transitional phase. The parents are working a lot and want help. The author is frustrated because they're paying for everything and feel unappreciated.\n\nOn one hand, the author is providing financial support, which is a big deal. It's reasonable to expect some reciprocity, like helping with chores. On the other hand, the kids might be overwhelmed with their own situations\u2014college, starting a job, adjusting to living at home again. Also, the author's reaction of yelling might be seen as harsh, especially since they mentioned not being a clean freak. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests there's tension around the financial support versus expectations of help.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In many families, when adult children live at home, they help out. But if they're not working and the parents are shouldering all expenses, maybe the parents are justified in expecting some help. However, the way the author expressed their frustration might have come off as controlling or using guilt, which could make the situation worse.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're paying for things, so the kids should help. But the son feels it's a transactional relationship where money equals ownership. That's a red flag. The author's reaction of yelling about the money spent on the outing might have been a power play, which isn't healthy. It's possible the author is in the wrong for not approaching the situation calmly and for making it about control rather than mutual respect.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because the approach taken could be seen as manipulative, and the expectation of help without addressing the underlying issues (like the kids' current life situations) might not be fair. The author needs to communicate better and find a balance between their needs and the kids' responsibilities.\n"
