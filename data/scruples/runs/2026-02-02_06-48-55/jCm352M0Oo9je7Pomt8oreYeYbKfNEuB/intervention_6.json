On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for things.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author has two adult children who moved back in. They're paying for everything\u2014house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun stuff. The kids don't have jobs yet, one is in college, the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours. The author is asking for help with chores, which the kids do a bit, but when asked specifically, the son responds with an excuse. The author gets angry and implies they feel owned.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for expecting appreciation and help. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nI think the key points here are the age of the children. They are adults, so the parent might expect them to contribute to household responsibilities regardless of financial support. However, the parent is providing a lot, which can set expectations. The son's response about feeling owned might indicate that the financial support is causing resentment or a sense of obligation, which isn't healthy. \n\nOn one hand, parents often support their adult children, especially when they're transitioning into independence. But on the other hand, expecting help around the house is reasonable. However, the author's reaction\u2014yelling and making the child feel guilty\u2014might be too harsh. The author could be in the wrong for using guilt-tripping tactics instead of calmly discussing expectations. Also, the son's excuse about setting up his room might be valid if he's just moved in and needs time, but the parent's frustration is understandable given the workload.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're using financial support as leverage for chores, which can be manipulative. Adults should contribute to household duties regardless of financial support. The parent's reaction might be too strong, and the way they're framing the situation could be seen as controlling. The children are adults and might need boundaries set without using guilt. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
