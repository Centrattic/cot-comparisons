He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for their housing, utilities, food, and even some fun activities, gas, and insurance. Neither has a job yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author is asking the kids to help around the house, but when they don't do enough, the author gets upset and yells, implying that the kids should show appreciation for the money spent by helping out. The son responds by saying that the author pays for things so they feel they own him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The kids are adults, so there's an expectation of contributing to household chores, especially when living under someone else's roof. The author is providing significant financial support, which might lead to a sense of entitlement. However, the author is also working long hours and might be stressed, leading to frustration when the kids don't help.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they are paying for everything, so the kids should help around the house. The kids, on the other hand, might feel that since they're not working, they're not in a position to contribute financially and maybe see chores as something they don't have to do if they're not paying. The son's comment about the author feeling they own him suggests there's some resentment or misunderstanding about the dynamic.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, in many households, it's common for adult children to contribute to chores even if they're not working. The parents are providing a home, which includes shared responsibilities. However, the author's response of getting angry and yelling might be seen as inappropriate, especially if the kids are already under stress or in a transition period. The author might be overstepping by using the money spent as a reason to demand help, which could be perceived as manipulative or expecting undue gratitude.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they are \"nowhere close to a clean freak\" and the house is lived-in. So maybe the expectations for cleanliness aren't too high, but the kids aren't meeting even basic expectations. However, the way the author expresses their frustration\u2014yelling and linking help to previous expenses\u2014might not be the best approach. It could come off as using guilt to enforce chores, which might not be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing a lot of support, and it's reasonable to expect some level of contribution, especially when they're working long hours. The kids might not realize the effort involved in maintaining the household beyond just providing money. There's a balance between setting expectations and enforcing them in a respectful way versus using emotional manipulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because expecting help when contributing financially is understandable. However, the approach taken\u2014yelling and using guilt\u2014could be problematic. So, maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), but their method of communication could use improvement. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the situation overall. If the core issue is expecting help, then maybe they aren't, but if it's about the way they communicated it, perhaps they are. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the act of expecting help. I think the answer is B (No), because expecting help is reasonable, but the manner could be better. But others might argue that the author's reaction is wrong, so maybe A (Yes). Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
