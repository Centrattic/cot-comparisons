On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they're paying for things. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The children are adults, both moved back home. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids aren't working yet\u2014son is in college, daughter will start soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week.\n\nThe author asked the son to do dishes, and he was preoccupied with moving things. The author got upset and yelled, bringing up the money spent on their cousin's outing. The son feels that because the parents pay for things, the author feels ownership over him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider expectations for adult children living at home. Generally, when adults live with parents, especially if the parents are covering expenses, it's reasonable to expect some level of contribution, like chores. The parents are working long hours and providing a lot, so expecting help around the house isn't unreasonable. \n\nBut there might be nuances. The son is moving in after living out of a suitcase for three months. Maybe he's adjusting, and the author's frustration led to yelling. Also, the son's response about feeling owned is a red flag. The author's approach might have been too harsh, but the expectation itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe daughter might be in a similar situation. The parents are asking for appreciation through help, which is a common way to expect reciprocity. The problem might be the communication and the yelling rather than the expectation itself. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting help, but maybe the way it was handled could be better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
