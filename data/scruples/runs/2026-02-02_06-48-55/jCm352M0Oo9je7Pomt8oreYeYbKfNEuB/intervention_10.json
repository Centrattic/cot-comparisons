On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for things. The situation is that both kids moved back home, and the parents are working a lot, paying for the house, utilities, gas, insurance, and even fun things. The kids don't have jobs yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents asked them to clean up, but the son didn't comply and made a comment about the parent feeling like they own him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are providing significant financial support. The kids are adults, so they might be expected to contribute to household responsibilities. But the parents didn't explicitly state that this contribution includes chores. The son's response suggests he feels the financial support is a way the parent tries to control him, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's reasonable for parents to expect some help, especially since they're covering many expenses. However, the way the parent approached it by yelling and linking financial support to chores might be seen as manipulative or unfair. The son's comment implies that the parent's offer of money is controlling, so the parent's reaction of linking that to chores could be a misunderstanding. The parent might not have communicated the expectation of help clearly, leading to the conflict. \n\nAlso, the daughter and son had recently used the parent's money for a night out, and the parent is upset they didn't help afterward. The daughter might be involved too, but the example is about the son. The parent's frustration is understandable, but using guilt or anger (\"pissed and yelled\") might not be the right approach. It's important to set clear boundaries and expectations. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, adult children can and should share in household duties regardless of financial support. However, the parent's method of enforcing this might be problematic. The parent's intention is to get help, but the way it's being framed as \"appreciation\" for financial support could be seen as transactional, which the son is reacting against. This could create resentment if the children feel they're being forced into labor because of money rather than a shared responsibility. \n\nSo, the parent isn't entirely wrong in expecting help, but the approach and the justification might be. The parent should have had a clear conversation about chores before expecting it, especially after linking it to money in a heated moment. The son's comment about the parent's ownership might be a result of previous dynamics where financial support was used as a form of control, which the parent might not be aware of. Therefore, the parent's reaction could be part of a pattern that's causing the son to push back. \n\nI think the answer is A (the parent is in the wrong) because the parent's approach was confrontational and possibly manipulative by tying chores to financial support. They should have established chore expectations without that guilt-trip element.\n"
