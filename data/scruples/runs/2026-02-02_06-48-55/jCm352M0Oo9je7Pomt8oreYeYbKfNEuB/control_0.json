On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house.\n\nFirst, the situation: the kids are 21 and 20, moved back home, parents are paying for their living expenses, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun. The parents work a lot, over 50 hours each. They asked the kids to help with chores, but the kids didn't do much. The son even said the author pays because they want to control him. The author got angry and yelled when the son didn't do the dishes, bringing up the fact that they spent money on their cousin the previous night.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to expect help in exchange for support. The author isn't a clean freak, just a lived-in home. The kids aren't working, one is in college, the other starting soon. \n\nI need to consider if the author is unreasonable. On one hand, parents often help kids financially, especially in tough times. But the author is asking for appreciation through chores. It's common for parents to expect some responsibility from adult children, especially when they're living at home and getting financial support. The son's response about feeling owned is a red flag. The author's reaction might be justified if they feel their support isn't appreciated. However, yelling and bringing up past expenses might be an overreaction. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help. Since the kids are adults and the parents are providing a lot, it's reasonable to ask for some contribution, like chores. The author isn't unreasonable for that. The son's attitude and lack of help could make the author's frustration valid. So the answer leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
