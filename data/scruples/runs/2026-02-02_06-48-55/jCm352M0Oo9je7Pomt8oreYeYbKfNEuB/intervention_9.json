On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for their expenses. The author provides context: their kids moved back home, they pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The author feels they're working long hours and expects some help with chores. They got upset when the son didn't do the dishes, even yelling about paying for their cousin's outing last night. The son reacts defensively, interpreting the author's actions as trying to \"own\" him.\n\nFirst, consider the children's age. They're adults, so expecting them to contribute to household chores is reasonable. However, the financial situation adds complexity. The author is providing significant financial support, which might create a sense of obligation. The key issue here is the balance between providing support and expecting reciprocal help. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given their workload. However, the way they expressed their frustration\u2014yelling and making the son feel guilty about the outing\u2014might be counterproductive. The son's defensive reaction suggests that the communication wasn't effective. The author might have overstepped by implying that their financial support is a transactional relationship, which could undermine the children's autonomy.\n\nAdult children have the right to privacy and independence, even while living at home. The author's approach could be perceived as controlling, especially with the son's comment about feeling owned. The author might need to set clear expectations without using guilt or financial leverage. Instead of linking chores to financial support, focusing on mutual respect and shared responsibilities might be more effective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's expectations of help are reasonable, their method of enforcing them through guilt-tripping about finances could be problematic. The children's right to independence and the potential damage to family dynamics from coercive tactics suggest the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
