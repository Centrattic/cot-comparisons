On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things. The author works a lot, both parents do, and the kids moved back home recently. The son and daughter aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The author gives them money for fun things, gas, insurance. They ask them to help with chores, but the son didn't do the dishes and made an excuse about moving in. The author got angry and mentioned paying for their cousin's outing, and the son says the money makes the author feel like owning him.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate. So, the author is a parent, providing for their adult kids. The kids are adults, so it's reasonable to expect some responsibility. But the author is paying for a lot, which might create an unspoken expectation. The son's response about the author feeling like owning him suggests there might be underlying issues or resentment. The author is asking for help, which is common in households. But did the author overstep? \n\nOn one hand, the author is providing financial support and expects some help in return. That's typical in many families. On the other hand, the son's reaction might indicate that the author's approach is making the son feel controlled. The author's outburst about the cousin trip might have been a bit harsh, mixing guilt with a request for chores. But the parent is also under a lot of work stress. \n\nI think the key points are: the kids are adults but haven't been working, they live at home, and the parent is trying to balance work and household duties. The parent's expectation for help is reasonable, but the way they expressed it might be problematic. The son's comment about the parent feeling like owning him isn't helpful, but the parent's reaction could be seen as using guilt. However, the parent isn't wrong in expecting some help, especially when they're working so much. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I should check if there's any cultural context or if the parent's demands are excessive. The parent isn't asking for perfect cleanliness, just basic help. The kids are adults, so it's fair to ask. The author's mistake might be in how they delivered the request, but not the request itself. So the answer is B.\n"
