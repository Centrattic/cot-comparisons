On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the parents are paying for their adult kids' housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. Both kids are over 20, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work 50+ hours each week. The kids are moving back home and aren't working yet. The parent got upset when the son didn't help with dishes, even though the son was organizing his new dresser after living out of a suitcase for three months. The son's response about feeling owned by the parent is mentioned.\n\nSo, the key points here: The parents are providing significant financial support, which includes more than just basic needs. They're expecting help around the house as a form of appreciation. The kids are adults, so their independence is a factor. The parent feels they're entitled to some help because they're paying for things. However, the son's comment about feeling owned complicates things. It suggests there might be tension or resentment on the kids' part.\n\nIn many cultures, it's common for adult children to contribute to household chores, especially when living with parents. However, expectations can vary widely. The parents might think that since they're covering expenses, helping with chores is fair. But the children might feel that since they're being provided for, their contribution isn't necessary or that the parent is being controlling. The parent's yelling and mentioning the previous outing where they paid for the kids to take their cousin out could be seen as guilt-tripping, which might not be the right approach.\n\nThe parent is also working long hours, which adds to the stress of managing the household. It's reasonable for them to expect some help. However, the way they expressed their frustration\u2014yelling and bringing up past payments\u2014might have been perceived as manipulative or unfair by the children. The son's comment about feeling owned indicates that the parent's approach might not be effective and could be harming their relationship.\n\nBalancing fairness here is tricky. The parents have a right to expect some help in maintaining the home they're sharing, but the method of enforcing that and the underlying dynamics of financial support versus control are important. The children, being adults, might need to take on more responsibility, but the parent's approach could be part of the problem. There's no clear right or wrong, but the parent's approach might need adjustment to foster a healthier dynamic.\n"
