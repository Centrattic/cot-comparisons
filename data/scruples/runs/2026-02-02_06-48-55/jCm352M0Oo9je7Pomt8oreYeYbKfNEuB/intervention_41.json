On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again. The author has two adult children, 21 and 20, who moved back home. The parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids aren't working, one is in college, the other is starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asked the kids to help around the house, but the son was resistant and made a comment about the author paying to own him. The author got angry and yelled about the kids taking the cousin out with their money and not showing appreciation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Hmm. Let's break it down. The author is providing a lot of financial support and is asking for help with chores. The kids aren't working, so maybe they don't have the same financial pressures. But they are adults. The issue here is whether it's reasonable to expect help in exchange for living at home and being provided for.\n\nIn many cases, it's common for adult children to contribute to household chores, especially when they live at home. The parents are working long hours, so they might be overwhelmed. However, the author's response was to yell, which might be seen as harsh. The son's comment about being \"owned\" suggests that there's a power dynamic issue here. The author is paying for things to feel like they own the kids, which is a problematic mindset. But the kids not helping is also a problem.\n\nThe author's anger might be justified because they're not being supported. But yelling and implying that the kids shouldn't have spent money given their lack of help could be perceived as guilt-tripping. It's a bit of a back-and-forth. The key points are: the parents are providing a lot, the kids are adults, and the author is asking for help. The kids aren't doing their share, but the author's approach might be too aggressive. The son's attitude is also not great. \n\nI think the author's request for help is reasonable, but the way they expressed it (yelling and using guilt) is unhelpful. The son's behavior is inconsiderate, but the parents could approach the situation more calmly to foster cooperation. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but their method of communication could be better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for making the request. Since the request itself is reasonable, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is how they handled it. So answer B.\n"
