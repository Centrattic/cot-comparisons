On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for things for them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult kids, 21 and 20, who moved back home. They cover housing, utilities, food, some fun money, gas, and insurance. Neither has a job yet, though one is in college and the other starts soon. The author works over 50 hours a week with their spouse. They've asked the kids to help with chores, and the kids did a couple of things. The author isn't a clean freak, just a lived-in home. The recent incident was about the son not doing the dishes despite being asked, leading to a yelling episode where the author mentioned paying for their cousin's outing. The son claims the author pays to feel in control.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is providing significant financial support, which is a big commitment. It's reasonable to expect some help in return, especially since they work long hours. Parents often expect their children, especially as adults, to contribute to household chores as part of living at home. The author's frustration is understandable given the workload and the effort to support the kids. The son's attitude, where he interprets the support as control, might be part of the issue here. Maybe the author's way of expressing their expectations came out as yelling, which isn't helpful, but the underlying request for contribution isn't unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are adults and might feel entitled to more independence. However, they are still living at home and receiving financial support, so there's a shared responsibility. The son's response about the author feeling ownership over him is a red flag\u2014it suggests possible resentment or a misunderstanding of the author's intentions. The author's outburst might have been a result of accumulated stress, but yelling isn't an effective way to address the issue. However, the core issue of expecting help in exchange for support isn't inherently wrong.\n\nI think the key points are: the author is providing a lot, the kids are adults but still dependent, and the author is asking for reasonable help. The method of communication might be flawed (yelling), but the expectation itself is fair. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might need to adjust their approach, but the expectation of contribution isn't unreasonable. The son's behavior and attitude are problematic too. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
