On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for their expenses. The author has two adult kids who moved back home, both aren't working yet (one in college, the other starting soon). The parents work long hours and the kids aren't contributing much around the house. The author gets upset and yells when the kids don't help, even mentioning that the son felt the money was a way to \"own him.\"\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. The parents are providing financial support, including housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and spending money. The kids, being adults, are supposed to help out around the house, but they're not doing much. The author expects gratitude and help in return, which is reasonable. But when they confront the kids, the son reacts negatively, feeling controlled. The author yells, which might not be the best approach.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the parents are in a tough spot. They're working a lot and shouldering the financial burden, which is normal for parents, but the kids are adults. Expecting them to contribute to household chores is fair. However, the way the author handles it\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might be counterproductive. The son's reaction suggests there's some underlying resentment or feeling of being manipulated by the money. The parents might not realize that their approach is making the kids feel like they're being bought, which isn't healthy. \n\nBut are they in the wrong? Well, it's a mix. The expectation for help is reasonable, but the method of enforcing it (yelling, guilt-tripping) could be the issue. The author is not in the wrong for expecting help, but maybe their approach is flawed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the situation as a whole. Since the core issue is the expectation versus the kids' reactions and the communication style, perhaps the author isn't entirely wrong. The kids aren't working yet, but that's temporary. The parents are providing a lot, and it's reasonable to ask for help. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they express it might be problematic. Still, the main question is about the rightness of the expectation, not the communication style. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because it's reasonable to expect adult children to help when they're being supported financially, even if the approach could be better.\n"
