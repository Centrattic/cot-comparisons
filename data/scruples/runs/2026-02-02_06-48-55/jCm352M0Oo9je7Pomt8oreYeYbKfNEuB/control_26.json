On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support. The situation is that both children moved back home, aren't working (one in college, the other starting soon), and the parents are working long hours. The parents provide housing, utilities, food, plus money for fun stuff, gas, insurance. They asked the kids to help clean, and the son had an excuse about setting up his room, leading to an argument where the parent felt the kids aren't showing appreciation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parents' request is reasonable. Since the kids are adults, it's typical to expect some level of responsibility. The parents are covering a lot financially, so expecting chores in return isn't unreasonable. However, the kids might feel pressured if they're in a vulnerable position. The son's comment about the parent feeling like they own him is a red flag, indicating possible resentment or manipulation.\n\nBut the parents are also trying to manage a household while working long hours. Their frustration is understandable. The question is whether the parent's approach is wrong. The parent did yell and brought up the money spent on the cousin's outing. That might have been harsh, especially if the kids feel they're being controlled. However, the core expectation of contributing to household chores isn't inherently wrong. The tone and approach might be issues, but the underlying request isn't. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe the delivery could be adjusted. The key is that expecting help in exchange for support is reasonable, even if the communication could be better.\n"
