On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent is paying for their adult kids' expenses and expects them to help around the house. The kids moved back in, aren't working (though one is starting soon and the other is in college), and the parent feels they should contribute more. The parent got upset when the son didn't help with chores, even yelling about it. The son's response was that the parent's financial support makes him feel owned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent is providing housing, utilities, food, and other expenses. They work long hours, and the kids aren't contributing enough with chores. The parent expects appreciation through helping out. On the other hand, the kids might feel they're being given a good life without being asked to do much in return. However, the parent isn't asking for payment, just help with basic chores. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting help. It's reasonable for parents to ask for some level of contribution from adult children living at home, especially when they're paying for various expenses. The parent isn't unreasonable about the cleanliness; they just want basic help. The problem might be the parent's reaction\u2014yelling and implying that providing for them is a transaction that requires repayment. The son's comment that the parent's payment makes him feel owned suggests that the parent's approach might come across as controlling. \n\nHowever, the parent's frustration is understandable. They're working hard and providing for the kids, and expecting some reciprocity is natural. The issue might be in how it's communicated. The parent's outburst could be seen as manipulative, using the money spent as leverage to demand help. That can create resentment. But is the parent in the wrong overall? They have a right to expect some help, but the way they expressed it might be problematic. \n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting help, but their approach could be. But the question is whether they're in the wrong in the situation described. The core issue is the expectation of help. In many cultures, adult children living at home are expected to contribute. However, if the parent is using financial support as a way to guilt-trip or manipulate, that's an issue. The parent's statement about paying for things so they can feel like they own the kid is something the parent should reflect on. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent might not be in the wrong for expecting help, but their method of enforcing it through guilt and yelling could be problematic. However, since the parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting help, the answer might lean towards No (B), but with the caveat that their approach needs adjustment. But if the main question is about the expectation itself, then the parent isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
