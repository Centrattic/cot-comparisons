On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house after paying for their expenses.\n\nSo the situation is that the parent is providing a home, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. Both kids moved back in, the son is in college and the daughter is about to start a job. The parents work over 50 hours each. They've asked the kids to help with chores, and the kids did some things. The parent got upset when the son didn't do the dishes and yelled about them taking their cousin out and the son's comment that the money makes the parent feel like they own him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the parents are providing a lot of support, and it's reasonable to expect some help in return, especially since they're living together. On the other hand, the kids are adults, and the parent might be projecting their own expectations onto them. The son's response about feeling owned could indicate resentment or feeling unappreciated. Maybe the parent's reaction was too harsh, especially if they're not a clean freak and the house is already lived in. The parent might be overstepping by expecting more than the kids can reasonably contribute, especially if the son is moving in and organizing his room. However, the parent is also working a lot and it's fair to want some help with chores. The issue might be communication. The parent's yelling could have been an overreaction, especially if the kid was just settling in. The son's comment about owing them is a red flag. So maybe the parent is partly in the wrong for not setting clear expectations and reacting with anger, but the kids might also be expected to contribute more. It's a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're asking for reasonable help in exchange for their support. However, the way they handled it might have been off. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with the consideration that there's room for better communication. Alternatively, if the parent is being overly controlling, then A. Hmm. The key is that the parent is asking for appreciation, which is reasonable, but the method might be harsh. The kids are adults and should contribute, but the parent's yelling and the son's feeling of ownership might be problematic. The author's position is valid but executed poorly. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the note that the approach needs adjustment. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but after analysis, maybe not. So the answer would be B.\n"
