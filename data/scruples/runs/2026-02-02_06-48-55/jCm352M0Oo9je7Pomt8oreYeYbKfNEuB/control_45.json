On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent is giving their adult children money, paying for things like gas, insurance, and letting them stay in the house with utilities and food. The kids aren't working, though one is in college and the other is about to start a job soon. The parent works a lot and is asking the kids to help with chores. When they don't, the parent got upset and yelled about them not showing appreciation for the expenses they've covered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The kids are adults, so they should be expected to contribute to the household they're living in. Even if the parents are covering most of the costs, it's reasonable to ask for some help around the house. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. So the expectations aren't unreasonable.\n\nBut wait, the kids aren't working yet. The son is in college, which might be time-consuming, and the daughter is starting a job soon. Maybe they're dealing with their own stress and schoolwork, so helping with chores isn't their priority right now. However, even if they're busy, some basic chores like dishes or cleaning should be manageable. The parent is working 50+ hours a week, so they're probably tired and want some assistance.\n\nThe parent's frustration is understandable. They're shouldering a lot of financial and emotional burdens. The son's response about the parent paying to \"own\" him is a bit strong. That suggests a possible resentment or misunderstanding about the parent's intentions. The parent is providing support, but the son might feel like it's a transaction, not an act of love or help.\n\nBut does that mean the parent is in the wrong for asking for help? The parent is not asking for a lot, just some appreciation and contribution. It's reasonable to expect that in a shared living situation, even if you're paying for everything, there's an expectation of mutual respect and effort. The parent's outburst might have been a bit harsh, but the underlying request isn't unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are adults. Maybe the parent should have set clearer expectations from the start. But since they moved back recently, it's possible the parent is adjusting. The key issue is whether the parent's request for help is too much. Since the parent mentions it's a \"very lived in home,\" they don't expect perfection, just some basic help. The son's excuse about moving in and setting up his room might be a temporary issue, but if he's been there for 3 months, maybe it's time to start contributing.\n\nThe daughter's situation might be different, but the main conflict is with the son. The parent's anger is misplaced in that they brought up the previous expense (taking the cousin out), which might not be a fair trade-off for chores. However, the parent's frustration is about the lack of help, not the expense specifically. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests there's a deeper issue, maybe about independence or how the parent is expressing their needs.\n\nIn summary, the parent isn't in the wrong for expecting some help around the house. It's reasonable to ask for appreciation and contribution, especially when they're working so much and covering expenses. The son's response is problematic, but the parent's request is fair. The parent could improve communication, but they aren't wrong for asking.\n"
