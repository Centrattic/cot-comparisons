On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for expecting their adult children to help with chores when they're paying for everything. The parent gives a lot of details: the kids moved back home, they pay for housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even extra money for fun. The kids are adults, 21 and 20, and while one is in college and the other is about to start working, they currently don't have jobs. The parent works long hours, and they're frustrated because the kids aren't helping with chores.\n\nThe key points here are that the children are adults, and the parent is covering most expenses. The parent's request is for basic help around the house. The parent feels they're not being appreciated and is upset when the kids don't comply. The son's response about the parent feeling like they own him is a bit harsh and could be contributing to tension.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's unreasonable to expect adult children living at home, especially when being supported financially, to contribute with chores. In many cultures, it's considered fair for family members to help out with household responsibilities regardless of age, but there's also the aspect of autonomy and personal boundaries. However, since the kids are still in a dependent situation (without jobs, moving back home), the parent's expectation might be seen as reasonable. The parent isn't demanding perfection but some basic help, which is understandable given their workload. The son's attitude and the parent's frustration are part of the dynamic here. The parent isn't necessarily wrong for setting this expectation, especially when they're providing significant financial support. The answer would likely be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
