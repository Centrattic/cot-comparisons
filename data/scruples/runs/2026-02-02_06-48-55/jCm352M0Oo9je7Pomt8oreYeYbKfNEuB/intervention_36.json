On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about adult children moving back home and the parent feeling they should help around the house.\n\nFirst, the author is paying for their kids' housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even fun activities. The kids aren't working yet\u2014one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. They've asked the kids to help with chores, which they did a bit. The author got angry when the son didn't do the dishes, mentioning that they paid for the kids to take their cousin out. The son seems to feel that the money is making the author feel in control, which is a sensitive point.\n\nI need to consider if expecting help in return is reasonable. Since the kids are adults and the parents are providing significant financial support, it's reasonable to ask for some household contributions. However, the author's reaction might have been harsh, especially yelling and using guilt-tripping by mentioning the money spent on the cousin outing. The son's response about feeling owned adds another layer\u2014maybe there's a power dynamic issue here. The parent might be overstepping if they're using money as leverage for chores, which could be manipulative. But the core need for help is valid. The parent isn't a clean freak, so expecting some basic help is normal. However, the way they expressed it might be the problem. So, the answer is tricky. The parent isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting help, but their approach could be better. But according to the options, it's either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Since the main question is about being in the wrong for asking for help, and the parent is justified in wanting some contribution, but maybe the way they handled it was poor. However, the options don't account for partial blame. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe the parent is not in the wrong for asking for help, but the son's resistance is also an issue. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for asking for help, but their method could be improved. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for the request itself. Since the request is reasonable, answer B.\n"
