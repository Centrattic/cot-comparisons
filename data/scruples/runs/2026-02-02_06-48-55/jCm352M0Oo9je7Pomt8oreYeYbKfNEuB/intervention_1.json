On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. The situation involves two adult children who moved back home, aren't working (one in college, the other starting soon), and the parents work long hours. The author mentions providing housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. They asked the kids to help clean, which they did a bit, but when the son didn't do the dishes, the author got angry and yelled about the money they spent for their cousin's outing.\n\nFirst, the key points: The kids are adults, so the expectation of contributing to household chores is reasonable. The author is providing significant financial support, which might imply a trade-off of responsibility. However, the author's reaction\u2014yelling and implying guilt-tripping the kids\u2014might be where things go wrong. The son's response about feeling owned suggests that the way the author framed the request (using money as leverage) could be coming off as controlling or manipulative, which might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nThe parent's argument is about fairness and appreciation, but using guilt and financial contributions as leverage could be seen as putting the kids in a position where they feel coerced. The line between reasonable expectation and overstepping might be in the method of communication. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting help, but their approach could be problematic. However, considering the kids aren't working (one is about to start), the parent's workload, and the fact that the house is \"very lived in,\" maybe the author isn't being unreasonable in asking for help. \n\nBut the son's comment that the parent pays for things so they can feel like they own him indicates that the parent's approach is harming the relationship. Using money as a reason for chores might be seen as transactional and not fostering a sense of shared responsibility. The parent might need to set clear expectations without using guilt. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the issue is the method (yelling, using guilt), then maybe yes. If it's about expecting chores in exchange for support, maybe not. But the key here is the tone and approach. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent is trying to get help in a household they support, but some might argue that the approach is wrong. However, given the context of their workload and the kids being adults, the parent's request is reasonable, even if the execution could be better. So, probably B.\n"
