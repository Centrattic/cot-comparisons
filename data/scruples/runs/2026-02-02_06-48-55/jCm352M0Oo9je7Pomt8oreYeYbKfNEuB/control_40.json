On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for their expenses. \n\nFirst, the situation: Both kids are adults, moved back in, the parents are paying for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun. The kids aren't working yet\u2014though one is going to college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours. The author asked them to help clean up, and when the son didn't do the dishes, the author got angry and mentioned the money they spend on them, especially after paying for the cousin's outing.\n\nThe son's response that the parents' payments make him feel owned is a key point. The author is upset because they feel they're providing for the kids and expect some help around the house. \n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about expectations in a living arrangement. The parents are providing significant financial support, but they're also working a lot. It's reasonable for a household to expect some chores, especially since these are adults. However, the parents are also giving money for \"fun\" things, which might imply a certain level of support without expecting labor in return. \n\nThe son's comment about feeling owned suggests that the dynamic might be more transactional than the parents intend. The parents might feel they're doing their part and expect reciprocation, but the kids might not see it the same way. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's common for families to discuss expectations when adult children move in. If there was no prior agreement, the parents might be assuming an unspoken expectation. However, the kids might not have that same understanding. \n\nSo, the parents aren't necessarily in the wrong for asking for help, but their approach\u2014especially yelling and bringing up money\u2014might be what's causing the conflict. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect help in exchange for housing and financial support. \n\nIn many cases, it's standard for roommates to contribute, so the parents have a point. But the way they handled the situation, especially the emotional reaction, might have made things worse. The son's feeling of being controlled could stem from the parents' tone rather than the request itself. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (No), because the parents aren't wrong for expecting some help, but their method could be improved. However, there's a nuance here. If the kids are in a position where they're not working and the parents are providing everything, the parents have a right to set some boundaries. The conflict arises more from communication than the expectation itself.\n"
