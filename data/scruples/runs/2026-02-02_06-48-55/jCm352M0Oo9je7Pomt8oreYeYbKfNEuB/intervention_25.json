On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent is asking their adult children, who live at home, to help with chores. The parent is paying for their housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun things. The children aren't working, though one is in college and the other is about to start a job soon. The parent feels that since they're paying for everything, the kids should help out around the house. The son, in particular, was asked to do dishes but was focused on organizing his stuff, and the parent got angry and yelled about them not showing appreciation after the parent paid for their outing with a cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the parent. They're providing significant financial support and might feel that contributing to household chores is a reasonable expectation. They mention they're not a clean freak and the home is \"very lived in,\" so maybe the expectations aren't super high. The parent is working long hours, so time is a valuable resource for them. However, the parent is also giving money for fun activities, which might be a point of contention. The son feels that the parent is trying to \"buy\" his compliance, which could indicate a deeper issue of control or resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the adult children are in a transitional phase. One is in college, which can be time-consuming and stressful. The other is about to start a job, so maybe they're preparing for that. They might not have the time or energy to help with chores as much as the parent expects. Also, adult children, even if living at home, might be forming their own habits and need time to adjust. The son's comment about the parent feeling like they \"own\" him suggests that there's a communication problem. The parent's yelling and bringing up the money might come across as guilt-tripping, which isn't healthy. \n\nIn terms of fairness, is it reasonable to expect help with chores when the parent is covering all the costs? Some people might say yes, as it's a shared living situation. Others might think that since the children aren't earning their keep through jobs, their contribution should be minimal given their current life stages. The parent's approach of yelling and attaching the request for chores to previous financial gestures (like the outing) could be seen as manipulative. It's possible the parent is right to want help, but the way they're approaching it is wrong. Alternatively, the parent is in the right because they're setting boundaries, and the children are in the wrong for not contributing. \n\nI need to balance the parent's right to expect help in a shared household with the children's right to some autonomy, especially as adults. The parent isn't a clean freak, so maybe the chores aren't too onerous. But if the children aren't working, maybe their contribution is less. The key issue here is the parent's method of expressing their expectations. Yelling and using the financial contributions as leverage might be the problem. The parent might be in the right in wanting help but in the wrong in how they're communicating it. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong overall for the situation. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the parent is partially right in expecting help but has overstepped by yelling and using guilt. The children's responses suggest they feel resentful, which might be valid if the parent's approach is heavy-handed. So maybe the answer is that the parent is in the wrong (A) because their method of expressing the request is inappropriate, even if the expectation itself is reasonable. However, another angle is that the parent is not in the wrong (B) because they're setting reasonable expectations for a shared living space. \n\nBut the main question is whether the parent is in the wrong for asking. The parent's action of yelling and using the financial aspect as a guilt trip might be the problem, not necessarily the expectation itself. So the parent might be in the wrong in how they handled it, not the request. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's correct. \n\nI think the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while wanting help is reasonable, the way they expressed it\u2014yelling and making it about the money\u2014might be inappropriate. It's possible the parent is right to want help but wrong in the approach. Alternatively, if the parent is in the right for setting boundaries, then B. But given the emotional response and the manipulation angle, A makes sense.\n"
