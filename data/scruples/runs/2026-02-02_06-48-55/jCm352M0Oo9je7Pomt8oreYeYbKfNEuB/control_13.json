      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent whose adult children have moved back home and aren't contributing to household chores despite the parent providing financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parent works over 50 hours a week, pays for the house, utilities, food, and even extras like gas, insurance, and fun activities. The children are 21 and 20, both adults. One is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parent has asked them to help around the house, which the children have done minimally. The parent got angry when the son didn't do the dishes, mentioning that they paid for the kids to take a cousin out, implying the kids should be grateful and help out. The son responds by saying that the parent pays for things so they can feel like they own him.\n\nNow, considering the roles here. The parent is providing significant financial support, which is a form of contribution. However, the parent is also asking for help with chores. The children are adults, so there's an expectation of some responsibility. But they are still in a transitional phase (college, about to start a job), which might affect their ability to take on more tasks.\n\nThe parent's main argument is about appreciation and fairness. They want the children to help out in exchange for the support they receive. The children, on the other hand, might feel that since they're being supported financially, they don't owe the parent help, or they might feel the parent is using money to control their actions, as the son's comment suggests.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for parents to expect some level of help from adult children, especially when they're living under the same roof. However, the parent is also working long hours, so maybe the expectation is reasonable. However, the parent's approach of yelling and bringing up past expenses might be seen as manipulative or guilt-tripping, which could be a red flag. The son's reaction might indicate that he feels pressured or that the parent is using financial support as a means of control, which complicates the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the children's perspective. If they are not working yet, their ability to contribute financially or through chores might be limited. The son in particular has been living out of a suitcase for three months, which might explain some disorganization. However, he did get a dresser, so there's a push for him to settle in, which implies some responsibility.\n\nThe parent's anger and yelling might be seen as overreacting, especially if the children are already under stress or dealing with their own situations (like starting a job). The parent's justification of their support (paying for the cousin's outing) could be a way to assert that they're entitled to help, but this might not be the most constructive approach.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether either party acted unreasonably. The parent is trying to set boundaries and expect some reciprocation, which is reasonable. However, the method of communication (yelling, using guilt) might be seen as harsh. The children not helping is also a bit inconsiderate given the parent's situation. \n\nSo, the parent is not entirely in the wrong for expecting some help, but the manner in which they expressed it might be problematic. The children's resistance might be due to feeling that their contributions are being manipulated. The parent's approach could be improved, but the expectation itself is fair. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the parent's request is reasonable, even if the delivery could be better.\n"
