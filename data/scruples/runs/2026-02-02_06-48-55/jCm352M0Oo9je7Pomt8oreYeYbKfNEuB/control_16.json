On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house. The key points here are that the children are adults, have moved back home, and the parents are covering all expenses including utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The parents work long hours, and the kids aren't working (one is in college, the other starts soon). The author got upset when the son didn't help with dishes, leading to an argument where the son accused the parent of feeling ownership over him.\n\nFirst, the parents are providing a lot of financial support, which is significant. As adults, the children are expected to contribute in some way, especially since they're living at home. It's reasonable for parents to expect some level of help with household chores, given the shared living space. However, the parents are also working extremely long hours, which might add to their stress and expectations for help.\n\nThe son's comment about the parent feeling ownership is a red flag. It suggests there might be underlying tensions or resentment in the relationship. The author's reaction of yelling could be seen as an overreaction, especially if the son had just been given a new dresser and was settling in. The parent might not have considered that the son was dealing with moving and setting up his space, which is a valid reason for needing time.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is not asking for excessive help but basic chores. The daughter and son have been doing a couple of things already, which is a start. The parent's frustration is understandable given the financial burden and long work hours. The question is whether the expectation is reasonable. Since the children are adults and the household is a shared living situation, expecting some level of contribution is fair. However, the approach taken by the parent\u2014yelling and making a public criticism about their outing with the cousin\u2014might have been harsh, leading to a defensive reaction from the son.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They might not be entirely, as they have a right to expect help. But their method of communication could be improved. The key here is balancing the expectation of help with the children's autonomy and the context of their current situations (moving in, one starting a job soon). The parent's right to expect help isn't wrong, but the way they expressed it might have crossed a line. However, the core issue of expecting help isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could be better. But since the question is a yes/no for being in the wrong, the answer is B.\n"
