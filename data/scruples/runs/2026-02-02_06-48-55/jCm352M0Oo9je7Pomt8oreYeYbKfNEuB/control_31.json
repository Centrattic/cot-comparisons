He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with household chores since they're paying for various expenses.\n\nFirst, the context: The parents have two adult kids who moved back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids aren't working (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parents work over 50 hours each week. They've asked the kids to help around the house, and while the kids did some things initially, there's been a recent issue where the son didn't help with dishes despite the parent's request. The mother got upset and mentioned the money they spent on the kids taking their cousin out, and the son's response implies that the money makes the mom feel like she owns him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the mom is wrong to expect help in exchange for the financial support.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The kids are adults, which means they're supposed to have some independence and responsibility. The parents are providing financial support, but not all parents expect chores from adult children. However, in many families, even with financial support, contributing to household chores is expected as a basic responsibility. The parents are working long hours and might be overextending themselves by supporting the kids financially while also handling all the chores.\n\nThe son's response about the mom feeling like she owns him is problematic. It suggests a possible resentment or misunderstanding from his side. But the mother's frustration is understandable. She's contributing a lot and might feel that some help is reasonable, especially since they're under the same roof. However, the way she expressed her frustration\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might not be the best approach.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, expecting help with chores in exchange for financial support isn't inherently wrong, especially with adult children. But the method of communication and the tone (yelling) could be part of the issue. Also, the son might have valid feelings if he's feeling coerced or manipulated, but that's on him as well. The mother's actions aren't necessarily wrong, but maybe she could approach it differently. The key is whether the expectation is reasonable. Since the kids are adults and living at home, it's reasonable to expect some contribution to household tasks. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
