On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the children are adults, 21 and 20, both moved back home. The parents provide housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun things, gas, and insurance. The son is in college, the daughter is starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asks the kids to help with chores, which they did a bit. The son didn't do the dishes despite the author's request, leading to an argument. The son's response implies that the parents paying for things makes him feel owned. The author gets angry and brings up their spending on the cousin outing.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's reasonable to expect adult children to contribute to household chores when the parents are covering most expenses. The children are not working, which adds to the parents' workload. The author feels they're doing their part by paying for things, but expects some gratitude and help. The son's attitude seems to be that the money given is a form of control. \n\nI need to consider societal norms. Typically, even when parents support adult children, some level of contribution to household responsibilities is expected. It's not just about paying for things but also about shared living. The parents are working long hours, so expecting help is understandable. However, the son's response might be a sign of resentment or misunderstanding. The author's reaction was to yell, which might be seen as excessive, but the underlying request isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe daughter might be a different case since she's starting a job soon, but the son is in college and hasn't been working. The parents are providing substantial support, but they're also doing a lot of work. It's a balance between parental support and fostering independence. The author isn't a clean freak, just asking for basic help. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests there's an issue with how the support is perceived, but the author's request for help is valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting some help. The son's attitude and the daughter's lack of contribution are the main issues here. The author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
