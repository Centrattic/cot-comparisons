      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has two adult children, 21 and 20, who moved back home within the last year. They're providing them with a house, utilities, food, money for fun stuff, gas, and insurance. Neither has a job right now, but one is in college and the other is starting a job soon. The parents both work over 50 hours a week. The author asked the kids to help around the house. The son, who's been living out of a suitcase for three months and just got a dresser, was asked to do the dishes so the parent could make dinner. He responded that he needed to put his clothes in the new dresser. The author got angry and yelled, mentioning that they paid for them to take their cousin out for food and drinks the night before and expected some appreciation. The son feels like the money is a way for the parent to \"own\" him.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting appreciation and help around the house.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The kids are adults, so they should be expected to contribute to household chores, especially since they're living in the home. The parents are providing a lot of financial support, which is understandable, but that doesn't necessarily mean the kids should be exempt from responsibilities. The son's response seems dismissive, but the author's reaction was yelling and bringing up past expenses to make a point about appreciation. \n\nThe key points here are: The author is providing financial support, but the kids aren't helping around the house. The author is asking for appreciation through chores, which is reasonable. However, the author's method of expressing this (yelling and bringing up past spending) might be seen as manipulative or unfair. The son's comment about feeling owned by the money adds another layer\u2014maybe the parent's financial contributions are perceived as control.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, expecting help around the house is reasonable for adult children. On the other hand, the author's approach of using financial support as leverage for chores might be seen as using guilt or manipulation. The son's behavior is also not ideal, but the parent's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially if the parent is trying to use money as a way to control rather than just support.\n\nBut the parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting help and appreciation. The core issue is whether it's fair to ask for help in exchange for financial support. Typically, in a household where multiple people live together, shared responsibilities are expected. However, the parent might be overstepping by linking financial support to chores in a way that the child feels is controlling. The parent's yelling and bringing up past expenses might not be the best approach, but the underlying expectation of help isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for expecting help, but their method of communication could be problematic. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because it's reasonable to ask adult children to help around the house when living together, even if they're being financially supported. However, the approach could be improved. The son's behavior is also not ideal, but the parent isn't entirely wrong for wanting some help.\n"
