On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for things.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult kids who moved back home. They pay for housing, utilities, food, and other expenses. The kids aren't working, but one is in college and the other is about to start a job. The author works 50+ hours a week and is asking them to help with chores. When the son didn't do the dishes, the author got angry and mentioned paying for their cousin's outing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nHmm. The key points here are the expectations of adult children. Since they are adults, even if they're still in college, they might be expected to contribute to household chores as a matter of responsibility. The author is providing financial support, but maybe they didn't set clear expectations from the start. The son's response about the author feeling like they own him suggests there might be some resentment or miscommunication. \n\nHowever, the author is also working long hours and trying to manage a household. It's reasonable to expect some help, especially when the kids are living in the home. The author's frustration is valid because they're contributing a lot and might feel it's fair to ask for some reciprocation. \n\nBut maybe the author's approach was harsh. Yelling and bringing up past payments could come off as manipulative or shaming. The son's behavior might be due to not having a job yet, but he's been there for three months. The author might need to set boundaries and communicate expectations without making it about money. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be partly to blame for how they expressed their frustration, but their desire for help isn't unreasonable. The kids might need to take more initiative in helping out. The author could have handled it more calmly and set clearer expectations earlier. I think there's some fault on both sides, but the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for the request itself. Since they are asking for help in return for financial support, which is common, the author isn't entirely wrong. But their reaction might be part of the issue. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
