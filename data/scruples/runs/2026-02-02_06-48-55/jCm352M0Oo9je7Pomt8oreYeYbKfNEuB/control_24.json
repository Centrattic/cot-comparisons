On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about adult children moving back home, and the parent is giving them money, paying for gas, insurance, etc. The parent is working a lot and expects help with chores. The kids aren't working except one is in college. The parent got angry when the son didn't do the dishes after being asked, and mentioned that they paid for their cousin's outing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The parent is providing financial support and expects help with household chores. The kids are adults, so they should be expected to contribute, even if they're not working. But maybe the parent is being too strict? The son's response about the parent paying for things to feel like they own him is a bit concerning. The parent might be overstepping, but on the other hand, it's reasonable to ask for help when you're providing a home.\n\nAlso, the parent mentioned not being a clean freak, so maybe the expectations for cleanliness aren't too high. The kids might not be used to contributing, especially if they were younger when they left home. The parent's frustration is understandable, but yelling and bringing up past expenses might not be the best approach. It's possible the parent is in the right in expecting help, but the way they expressed it might be part of the issue. However, the main question is whether the parent is in the wrong for asking for appreciation and help. Since the parent is providing significant support, it's reasonable to ask for some reciprocation. So, probably the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
