On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for the kids' housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun stuff. The kids aren't working yet\u2014though one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours. The author is asking the kids to help with chores, and when the son didn't do the dishes, the author got angry and mentioned the money they spend on them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is overstepping. The kids are adults, so they should contribute to household chores, right? But they're still in a dependent situation. The parents are providing a lot, so expecting some help is reasonable. The son's response about the author trying to \"own him\" by paying for things is a red flag. That suggests there's some resentment or past issues. \n\nBut the author is asking for appreciation through helping around the house. Is that fair? Well, even if the parents are paying for everything, it's normal for housemates to share chores. The parents are working hard, and maybe the kids are not taking responsibility. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way they reacted\u2014yelling and bringing up money\u2014might not be the best approach. It could come off as manipulative or controlling. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help. Since the kids are living in the house, it's reasonable to ask for their contribution. The parents are not asking for a lot, just basic help. The son's attitude and the daughter's lack of help might be the real issues here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting appreciation through chores. The problem might be the communication style, but the expectation itself is valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
