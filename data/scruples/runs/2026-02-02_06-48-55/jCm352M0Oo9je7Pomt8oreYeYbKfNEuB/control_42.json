On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.

Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for financial support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's two adult children, a 21-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter, moved back home. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. Neither child has a job yet (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parents work over 50 hours a week. The author is frustrated because they don't get enough help with house chores. The son, in particular, didn't do the dishes when asked, even after being given a dresser after living out of a suitcase for months. The author yelled about the kids spending money on their cousin and not showing appreciation.\n\nNow, the key points here are the expectations of the parents versus the children's actions. The parents are providing significant financial support, which is common for adult children, but they expect in return that the kids help around the house. The children, however, don't seem to meet these expectations, and the son's comment about the parents paying to feel they own him is a red flag.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In many cultures, parents expect their adult children to contribute to household chores, especially if they're living at home and receiving financial support. However, the children's perspective might be that since the parents are providing for them, they aren't required to do chores. The son's attitude of resentment (\"you pay for things so you can feel like you own me\") suggests a lack of appreciation and possible conflict in the household.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They're working long hours and providing a lot, yet not getting the help they expect. The response of yelling and bringing up the cousin's outing might not have been the best approach, but the underlying expectation isn't unreasonable. The children's lack of contribution could be seen as ungrateful, especially since they're not contributing financially either.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that adult children might have different views on responsibility. Maybe they feel they're helping in other ways or that the parents should handle chores. The author's situation isn't about being a clean freak, so the request for basic help (dishes, cleaning) seems fair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they're providing. The children's lack of contribution and the son's resentful attitude are the main issues here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
