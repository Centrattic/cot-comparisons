On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for various expenses. The author's kids are 21 and 20, both moved back home recently. The mom is giving them money for fun, gas, insurance, and they don't have jobs yet (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parents work long hours.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of the adult children. Since they're adults, the parents might feel they should contribute to household chores. But the son's response about feeling owned because of the money adds a layer of complexity. The author got angry and yelled, which might not be the best approach. \n\nIn most cases, adult children are expected to contribute to home responsibilities, especially if the parents are working hard and the kids are staying in their home. However, the author's reaction could be seen as unfair if the kids don't have a job and the chores are seen as a way to repay, but maybe the author's tone was too harsh. Also, the son's comment suggests possible resentment about the financial support, which might indicate an underlying issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the author is setting reasonable expectations for help with chores as part of living at home, then maybe not. However, the yelling and tying financial support to chores could be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the author's request was framed. If the author is using money as leverage or guilt-tripping, that's one thing. But if it's a fair expectation, then maybe not. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the situation. The parents are providing a lot, but the children aren't working yet. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might be an issue. The son's behavior (living out of a suitcase for 3 months) might suggest he's not contributing much. \n\nSo, the author's expectation is reasonable, but the way they expressed it (yelling, implying obligation) might be where they go wrong. The son's comment about feeling owned indicates that the author's approach might be coming off as controlling, which could be the root of the problem. Therefore, the author is partly in the wrong for their reaction and how they framed the request. But the underlying expectation of helping with chores isn't unreasonable. Maybe a B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the expectation is valid, but the execution could be better. But since the user is asking if the author is \"in the wrong\" overall, and the main issue is the author's frustration and yelling, perhaps A (Yes). Hmm. It's a bit tricky. I think the core of the issue is the author's approach rather than the expectation itself. So the answer is A.\n"
