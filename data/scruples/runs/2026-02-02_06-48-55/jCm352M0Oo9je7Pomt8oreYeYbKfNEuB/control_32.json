On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're being supported financially.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent is paying for their adult kids' housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving money for fun activities. Both kids live at home, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The parent feels they're providing a lot and expects some help with chores. The kids have done some things, but when asked about dishes, the son prioritized setting up his room and there was an argument about the parent feeling the kids don't appreciate the support.\n\nThe parent yells and brings up the money spent on their cousin's outing. The son accuses the parent of wanting to \"own\" him when money is mentioned. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for asking for help in exchange for financial support.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are expectations of adult children contributing, the parent's stress from long hours, and the kids' behavior. Legally, parents aren't required to support adult children, but culturally, there's a lot of nuance. The parent is providing a significant amount, which many would consider generous. However, the kids are adults, so there's an expectation that they might contribute in some way, especially in a shared household.\n\nThe parent isn't a clean freak, so the expectation isn't unreasonable. The kids have done some chores but not enough. The parent's frustration is understandable, given the workload and financial investment. However, the way they expressed it\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses\u2014might not be the best approach. The son's response about the parent \"owning him\" suggests there's some resentment or communication issues.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the parent is wrong for expecting help. Most people would agree that in a shared living situation, especially when the parents are contributing so much, some level of household responsibility is reasonable. The parent isn't demanding perfection but basic help. The kids not contributing could be seen as not respecting the effort the parents are making.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent could be more diplomatic. Yelling might escalate the situation. However, the parent isn't wrong in their expectations. The son's attitude of refusing to help despite the support is problematic. So, the parent isn't in the wrong for seeking appreciation and help, even if the delivery could be improved. The answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
