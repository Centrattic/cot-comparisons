He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they're paying for everything. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children, ages 21 and 20, who moved back home. They provide housing, utilities, food, and even money for fun, gas, and insurance. Neither has a job yet (though one is starting soon and the other is in college). The parents work over 50 hours each. The author asks the kids to help with chores, which they do a little. The son responds by saying the author's payments make him feel owned, and the author yells about showing appreciation after they spent money on their cousin.\n\nNow, the key points here: The children are adults, so the expectation of contributing might be reasonable. The parents are providing significant financial support, which could imply an understanding of household responsibilities. However, the son's reaction suggests he feels the support is controlling, and the author's response was to yell, which might be seen as harsh.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions they're not a clean freak and the house is \"very lived in,\" so maybe the expectations for cleanliness aren't unreasonable. The kids are in a transitional phase (college, starting a job), so maybe their priorities are elsewhere. The parent's frustration is understandable given the workload and financial burden.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling and implying that money should make them grateful might not be effective. It's possible the parent's approach is contributing to the tension. The son's comment about feeling owned indicates a possible power dynamic issue. The author might need to address this with more communication rather than anger.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent isn't in the wrong for expecting some help, as it's common in households. However, the way the author expressed it might be problematic. The key is whether the expectation is reasonable. Since the kids are adults, expecting them to contribute is just, but the method of communication (yelling) and the implication of ownership through money could be where the parent is overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because expecting adult children to help is reasonable, but they might need to adjust their approach. However, some might argue A if the yelling is considered unfair. But the core issue of expecting help isn't wrong.\n"
