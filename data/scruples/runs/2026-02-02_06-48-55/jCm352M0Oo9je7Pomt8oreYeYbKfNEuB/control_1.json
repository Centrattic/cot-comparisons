On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their adult children, who moved back home, to help with housework in exchange for financial support.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun activities. The kids are 21 and 20, both moved back in the past year, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author is frustrated that the kids aren't helping around the house, especially after being asked multiple times. The son's response about organizing his new dresser and the cousin outing last night led to a yelling incident. The son also claims the author's payments make him feel owned.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author is wrong for expecting gratitude and help from their adult children. The kids are adults living at home, so the parent might reasonably expect some contribution. However, the parent is providing significant financial support, which could be seen as a trade-off for the kids' help. The son's comment about feeling owned suggests there's some tension here.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, adult children living at home are expected to contribute to household chores. The parents here are working long hours and covering all expenses, so asking for help with basic tasks like dishes is reasonable. The author isn't asking for a clean freak-level environment, just a lived-in home with some help.\n\nOn the flip side, the kids might feel they're being used. They're not working yet (one in college, the other about to start), so they might not see the need to help if they're not contributing financially. The author's frustration is valid because they're shouldering all costs and expecting some reciprocity. However, the way the author expressed their anger by yelling about the cousin outing might have been harsh. Instead of yelling, a calmer approach could help set expectations without making the kids feel attacked.\n\nThe key points are: the parent is providing extensive support, the children are adults, and there's an expectation of mutual respect and contribution. The author's request for help isn't unreasonable, but the method of communication might be part of the problem. The son's defensive reaction indicates possible resentment, which might stem from feeling the parent is controlling or using guilt.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a valid point in expecting help, the situation isn't entirely their fault. However, the approach taken (yelling and accusations) could be problematic. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong but needing to adjust their communication style.\n"
