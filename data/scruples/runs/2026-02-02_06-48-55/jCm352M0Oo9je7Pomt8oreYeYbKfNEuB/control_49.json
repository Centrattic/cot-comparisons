On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for their expenses. \n\nFirst, the context: the kids are 21 and 20, back home after moving in the past year. The parents cover housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even give money for fun. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starts soon. The parents work long hours. The author asked for help around the house, which the kids did a bit. The author isn't a clean freak, but there's a \"lived in\" home. \n\nThe incident: The son was asked to do dishes, but he wanted to organize his new dresser (he'd been living out of a suitcase). The author got upset and yelled, mentioning the expense of taking the cousin out. The son claims the author pays to feel in control.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for expecting help in exchange for financial support.\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable for parents to expect some level of contribution from their adult children, especially when they're living at home and being supported financially. The kids aren't working yet, so contributing around the house is part of shared household responsibilities. The author isn't unreasonable in asking for help, and the son's response (saying the author pays to own him) seems dismissive of gratitude or contribution.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction might have been harsh. Yelling could be seen as an overreaction, especially since the son was dealing with moving in and organizing his space. The author might have approached it more calmly to avoid conflict. Also, the fact that the son is still adjusting (living out of a suitcase for months) might mean he's not yet able to take on chores effectively.\n\nBut overall, the expectation isn't unreasonable. The key point is that the author is providing significant financial support and is entitled to some help maintaining the home. The son's attitude of entitlement and lack of appreciation is problematic. The author isn't wrong for wanting their support to be acknowledged through chores. The main issue might be the method of expressing that expectation, but the expectation itself is valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
