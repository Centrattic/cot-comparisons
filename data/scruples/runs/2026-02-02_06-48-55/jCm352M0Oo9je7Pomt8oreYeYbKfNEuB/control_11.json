He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their adult children moving back home and not helping with chores. The parents are paying for the kids' housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even giving them money for fun stuff. The kids aren't working, but one is in college and the other starts a job soon. The parents work long hours, and they're asking the kids to help around the house. When they ask, the kids do some things, but not all. The son even made a comment about the parent's money making him feel owned, and the parent got upset and yelled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The parents are providing a lot of financial support, so they might feel entitled to some help. But the kids are adults, so maybe they have different perspectives. The son's comment about feeling owned is a red flag. That suggests there's some resentment or misunderstanding. The parent's reaction was yelling, which could be seen as over the top, especially if the kid is already stressed or has a different view on responsibility.\n\nBut then again, the parents are working hard and might be overwhelmed. They're paying for a lot, and the lack of help from the kids adds to their burden. The key here is whether the parent's request for appreciation and help is reasonable. They mentioned they're not a clean freak, so the house isn't spotless, but expecting some basic chores in exchange for financial support seems fair. However, the way the parent expressed it\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses like taking the cousin out\u2014might have been harsh. That could be seen as guilt-tripping or using emotional manipulation, which isn't healthy. The son's response about feeling owned implies that the parent's approach might be controlling, which could be why the kids aren't helping as expected.\n\nSo, the parent's intention might be valid\u2014they want fair contribution. But the method of enforcing it, through yelling and guilt-tripping, might be the issue. The parent isn't wrong in wanting help, but the way they communicated it could be problematic. The kids are adults, so maybe the parent needs to approach this with more respect and set clear, mutual expectations rather than using emotional pressure. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong in wanting help, but the approach taken was inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for appreciation and help. Since the request itself is reasonable, but the delivery wasn't, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the core request is valid, even if the method could be improved.\n"
