On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they're providing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The adult children are 21 and 20, both moved back home. The parents pay for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starting soon. The parents work long hours. The author asks them to help with chores, and after some initial compliance, there's an incident where the son doesn't do the dishes and the author yells about it. The son seems to feel that the money makes the parents feel they own him.\n\nSo the main question is whether it's fair to expect help in exchange for financial support. From a general perspective, it's common for parents to expect some level of responsibility from their adult children, especially when they're living at home and receiving financial support. However, the tone and approach might matter. The author got angry and yelled, which could be seen as harsh, but the underlying expectation isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe kids' responses are also important. The son's comment about the author feeling ownership is a red flag. It suggests that the communication might be strained, and the kids might not perceive the request as fair. But the author is trying to balance their own workload and expecting some reciprocation.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are already taking on a lot by supporting their children financially while working long hours. It's reasonable to expect some help with household chores to share the load. The key is whether the author's approach was fair. Yelling might not be the best method, but the expectation itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to expect some help in exchange for the support they're providing. However, the way they expressed it could be improved. The answer should be B (No), as the author is not wrong for having this expectation, even if the communication could be better.\n"
