On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house when they pay for various things. \n\nFirst, the situation: both kids are adults, moved back home, parents are working over 50 hours each, and they're paying for the kids' expenses like gas, insurance, food, and fun activities. The kids aren't working yet (one in college, the other starting soon). The parent got angry when the son didn't do the dishes after they paid for something like taking the cousin out.\n\nThe author's argument is that since they pay for things, the kids should help out. But the son feels like the money makes the parent feel they \"own him.\" \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, parents often support adult children financially, but expecting help around the house is reasonable. However, the parent's reaction\u2014yelling and bringing up money\u2014might be seen as using guilt or financial leverage. The son's response suggests he feels controlled, which could make the parent's approach problematic. \n\nBut the parent is also managing a lot, working long hours, and it's reasonable to ask for some help. The key points are the right to expect help versus the method of communicating it. The author might be right to ask for help but wrong in how they framed it, making it about money and ownership. That could be inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because of how they expressed their request, not necessarily the request itself.\n"
