On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they're paying for things. The situation involves two adult kids who moved back home, the parents work a lot, and the kids aren't working (one is in college, the other starting soon). The parent got upset when the son didn't help with chores and mentioned paying for their outings. The son feels the parent is trying to control him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent is providing financial support, including housing, utilities, food, and even fun expenses. The kids aren't contributing monetarily but maybe through chores. The parent feels it's reasonable to ask for help in exchange for the support they provide. The son's reaction is defensive, saying the parent pays to feel in control. \n\nIn many cultures, it's common for parents to expect some level of responsibility from their adult children, especially when they're still living at home and receiving financial support. However, since they're adults, there's a balance between being a parent and respecting their independence. The parent might feel justified in asking for help to maintain the household, which benefits everyone. \n\nBut here's the catch: the parent is working long hours and might be stressed. The kids, on the other hand, might be in a transitional phase, dealing with school or starting a job soon. Their lack of work might mean they have different priorities or aren't used to contributing domestically. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it\u2014yelling and implying that money is owed\u2014might come across as controlling or manipulative.\n\nThe son's response suggests he feels the parent is using money to exert control, which could indicate underlying issues in the parent-child relationship. The parent might be projecting their own stress onto the kids, expecting gratitude that isn't being expressed as they want. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate expectation for help in exchange for support, but the manner in which they enforced it (yelling, guilt-tripping) might be problematic. The key question is whether expecting help is reasonable versus using financial support to guilt-trip them. The parent's actions could be seen as overstepping if the expectation wasn't clearly communicated or if the kids have other valid reasons for not contributing (like adjusting to their new living situation). \n\nAlternatively, since the kids are adults, the parent might have a right to set boundaries. But the approach taken here seems to blend financial provision with emotional manipulation (\"one would think they'd show appreciation\"), which complicates things. The parent might be in the right in wanting help but in the wrong in how they approached the situation, leading to conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they might be using financial support to guilt-trip the kids instead of setting clear expectations. However, others might argue that the parent is not in the wrong because they're entitled to help in exchange for support. But the key issue is the tone and the implication that money entitles them to control, which could indeed be wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
