He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house in exchange for the financial support they provide.\n\nFirst, the children are adults, 21 and 20. They moved back home, and the parents are covering housing, utilities, food, plus extra expenses like gas, insurance, and fun activities. The parents work over 50 hours a week each. The children aren't employed yet, though one is starting a job soon and the other is in college.\n\nThe author asked for help with chores, and the kids did some. The son didn't do the dishes when asked, saying he needed to organize his new dresser. The author got upset and mentioned the money they spent, like taking the cousin out to eat. The son interprets the financial support as the parents feeling ownership over him.\n\nSo, the key points here are expectations of adult children. Are they obligated to help because the parents are providing financial support? In many cultures, it's common for adult children living at home to contribute with chores, especially when the parents are working hard. The parents are clearly feeling stretched, working long hours, and providing a lot. The kids, while in a transitional phase (college, starting a job), might be expected to help out a bit more.\n\nBut the son's reaction is problematic. Saying that the money makes the parents feel they own him is a defensive attitude. The author's frustration is understandable. They might be asking for basic help, not a lot. The author isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the way the author expressed their anger\u2014yelling and bringing up the money\u2014might have been harsh. Maybe an argument here is about communication style. But the core issue is whether expecting help is fair. Since the kids are being financially supported, it's reasonable to ask for some reciprocation through chores.\n\nThe kids aren't children anymore; they're adults. It's about balancing their needs for space to transition and the parents' need for help. The parents aren't unreasonable in their ask, but the method could be improved. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting help. The kids' lack of appreciation and the son's attitude are the main issues here. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
