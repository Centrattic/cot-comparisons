On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their adult children to help with chores since they pay for their expenses.\n\nFirst, the author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun things. The kids aren't working yet, one is in college, the other starting a job soon. The parents work over 50 hours each week. The author asked them to help around the house, which they did a bit. The son was living out of a suitcase for 3 months and got a dresser. When asked to do dishes, he prioritized setting up his room, leading the author to get angry and mention that they paid for their cousin's outing. The son feels the money is to make the author feel in control.\n\nSo, the main points here are about expectations of gratitude and responsibility from adult children. The author is providing financial support but wants some reciprocation through chores. The kids, however, aren't working and might not see the chores as necessary. The son's response about feeling owned suggests there's some tension there.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's common for parents to expect help with chores, especially when they're covering significant expenses. The author isn't unreasonable to ask for assistance, but the approach might be an issue\u2014yelling and bringing up past expenses could come off as manipulative or unfair. The son's feeling of being controlled might be valid if the author frames financial support as a reason for chores in a way that feels coercive.\n\nBut the key is whether the author is in the wrong. The author has a right to expect some help maintaining the household, especially when working long hours. However, the way the author expressed frustration (yelling, linking chores to past expenses) might be problematic. The son's living situation (living out of a suitcase) indicates that the author is also providing resources beyond just money, so expecting some contribution isn't unreasonable. The son's response about \"owning him\" might be a defensive reaction, but the author's behavior could be seen as reasonable in setting boundaries. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting help, but the method might need adjustment. The core issue is about balancing financial support with household responsibilities. The author isn't wrong for asking for help, so the answer would be B.\n"
