On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author has two adult children who moved back home. They pay for the house, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun stuff. The kids aren't working, one is in college, the other starts a job soon. The parent works 50+ hours a week. The parent is asking the kids to help around the house, but when they don't, they feel it's disrespectful because they're paying for everything. The son even says the parent pays to feel like an owner.\n\nFirst, the parent is asking for help, which is reasonable. Adult children living at home often contribute in some way. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants basic chores. The kids aren't working, so maybe they have more time to help. The parent is frustrated because they're covering expenses and expects some reciprocation. However, one child is in college, which can be time-consuming. The other is about to start a job, so maybe they're transitioning.\n\nThe son's comment about the parent paying to feel like an owner is a red flag. That could indicate resentment or a feeling of being controlled. The parent's response of yelling and bringing up the money they spent on the cousin outing might come off as manipulative or guilt-tripping. While the parent's intent is to get help, the method of expressing frustration could be seen as unfair, especially if the kids feel pressured.\n\nBut the parent is also trying to maintain a household where they're working long hours. It's reasonable to expect some help from the kids who are not working. The parent isn't asking for unreasonable tasks, just basic chores. The issue might be in how the request is made and the emotional response, but the core request isn't wrong. The kids might need to step up, but the parent isn't entirely in the wrong either. They have a right to expect some contribution towards household responsibilities. The answer might hinge on whether the parent's approach is the problem rather than the expectation itself.\n"
