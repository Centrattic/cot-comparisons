On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for everything. The kids are 21 and 20, back home, not working (though one is starting soon), and the parents work a lot.\n\nFirst, the parents are providing a lot: housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even money for fun. The kids aren't contributing with chores, which the parent expects as appreciation. The son's response about the parent feeling like they own him is probably hurtful, but does the parent have a right to expect help?\n\nAdult children are adults, so they should have some responsibility. But the parent is also providing significant financial support. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect chores in return. The parent isn't a clean freak, just wants a lived-in home. The kids did help a bit but maybe not enough. The parent's reaction was yelling, which might be harsh, but the expectation itself might be valid. The son's comment about ownership is a red flag, suggesting a power dynamic issue. But the core issue is whether the parent is wrong to ask for help. \n\nConsidering that the parent is contributing financially and the children are adults, it's reasonable to expect some household responsibilities. The parent isn't unreasonable about the cleanliness. The problem might be in the communication style (yelling), but the request itself isn't wrong. So the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
