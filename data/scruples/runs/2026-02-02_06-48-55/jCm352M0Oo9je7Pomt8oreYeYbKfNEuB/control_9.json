On top of providing a house with utilities and food, I give them money to do fun things as well as paying for gas and insurance.  Neither one has a job, but one is going to college and the other is starting in a week).  My DH and I each work 50+ hours/week.  Over the past few days I've asked them to clean up around the house, and they did a couple things.  Just to be clear, I am nowhere close to a clean freak; we have a very lived in home.    \nToday, I asked my son to do the dishes so I could make dinner, to which he replied that he needed to put his clothes into his new dresser and wanted to get his room situated.  He had been living out of his suitcase for 3 months, so we got him a dresser.  But, I got pissed and yelled that one would think that after paying for him and his sister to take their cousin (from another state) out eating/drinking last night, that they would show some appreciation by helping out.  Anytime I bring up money he says that I pay for things so that I can feel like I own him.    \n\n\nAITA for asking them to show appreciation for what they have by helping clean the house?   \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for expecting their adult children to help around the house since they pay for their expenses.\n\nFirst, the parents are covering housing, utilities, food, gas, insurance, and even some fun money. The kids are adults, moved back home, and one is going to college while the other is about to start a job. The parents work long hours. They've asked the kids to help with chores, and the son is resistant, even after getting a new dresser. The parent got upset and mentioned the money they spent on the kids taking their cousin out. The son seems to feel that the money is a form of control, which adds tension.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to expect gratitude and help from adult children when you're covering their expenses. I think it's reasonable for parents to expect some level of responsibility and help, especially since they're contributing significantly. The parents are working hard and it's a two-way street. However, the parent did yell and made a comment about the money being manipulative, which might have been harsh. But overall, the expectation isn't unreasonable. The kids are adults, so they should contribute to the household. The answer is probably B.\n"
