Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains that they're used to a family culture where they leave trash in public places, like malls and stadiums. Their friend criticized them, so now they're conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some places, people might leave trash expecting others to clean up, while others expect personal responsibility. The author's reasoning is that theaters have cleaners and the cost of going to the movies is high, so maybe it's not their problem. But is that a valid excuse?\n\nEnvironmental and social responsibility come into play here. Leaving trash isn't just about individual habits; it's about contributing to a clean environment. Even if there are cleaners, it's a matter of respect for the space and others. Plus, movie theaters are shared spaces where maintaining cleanliness affects everyone's experience.\n\nThe author's argument that there are people to clean might be a bit of a cop-out. If everyone left trash, the workload for cleaners would increase, and it's a courtesy to minimize their burden. Also, the cost of tickets doesn't justify littering. People pay for the experience, which includes a clean environment.\n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because it's a social expectation in many places to dispose of your trash. The author's hesitation to be an \"asshole\" shows they care, but they need to balance that with social norms. So, while the author isn't the worst person, they are in the wrong for not disposing of their trash when it's a shared responsibility. The answer should be A.\n"
