      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person mentions their family's culture of not cleaning up in public places like food courts, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend called them out, and now they're conflicted because they think the theater has cleaners and it's expensive to go there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general social norms. In most places, it's expected to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate to others and a burden on staff. The fact that there are cleaners doesn't mean it's okay to litter; it's still about personal responsibility. \n\nThe person argues that theaters have staff, but even so, it's a shared space. Leaving trash increases the workload for those employees, who might already have a lot to do. Plus, in a post-pandemic world, maintaining cleanliness is more important, and everyone should do their part. \n\nThe cost of the movie tickets is a bit of a red herring. Paying for the ticket doesn't excuse not cleaning up. Also, the number of people in the theater (30 seats) isn't a strong argument if multiple people do the same, it could add up to a lot of trash for the staff to handle. \n\nThe person's family culture isn't a justification either. Social norms have evolved, and what was acceptable in the past might not be now. Being considerate is part of being a good citizen. They also mention not wanting to be an asshole, which shows they have some awareness. \n\nSo, even though they aren't malicious, the action of leaving trash is socially frowned upon. The friend's reprimand is a sign that the person's behavior is perceived as inconsiderate. The key point is that it's a small act that contributes to a cleaner environment for everyone. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
