      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that in their family, they didn't do that, like at the mall food court, football stadiums, etc. A friend called them out, and now they're conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The author's family doesn't dispose of trash in public places, which might be a family tradition. But in many places, especially in the US, it's common to clean up after yourself in public spaces like theaters. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate because it's the staff who have to clean it up, and it might contribute to more work for them. The author argues that movie theaters aren't as crowded as they used to be and that it's expensive to go to the theater, so maybe the effort isn't worth it. However, the key point is about responsibility and respect for others' work.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the friend expects the author to clean up. The author is trying to balance their upbringing with social expectations. The question is whether the author is wrong for not doing so. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, most places do expect individuals to dispose of their trash properly. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash makes their job harder. The author's reasoning that it's not a big task because there are fewer people might not hold up because even a few people can create litter. Also, the cost of going to the theater is a personal expense and doesn't justify not cleaning up. \n\nSo, while the author's family culture is a factor, societal expectations generally lean towards cleaning up after oneself. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not disposing of the trash, even if their intention wasn't malicious. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the expected social behavior is to clean up, and not doing so is inconsiderate regardless of family habits.\n"
