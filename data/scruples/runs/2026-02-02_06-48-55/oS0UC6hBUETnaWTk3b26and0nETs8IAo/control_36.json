Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person explains that they grew up in a family culture where they didn't dispose of trash in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend criticized them after a movie, but they argue that theaters have staff to clean up, especially with the high cost of movie tickets these days. They want to know if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In public spaces, people generally expect others to dispose of their trash properly. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate because it adds to the mess that others have to clean, even if there are staff. It's a matter of respect for the environment and the people who work there. \n\nThe person mentions that movie theaters now have around 30 seats, implying maybe smaller venues, but even so, leaving trash can affect the experience for others. The cost of tickets being high might not be a valid excuse for not cleaning up. Also, their family's past behavior doesn't necessarily justify it if current societal expectations have changed.\n\nHowever, the person isn't causing direct harm beyond the cleanup. But the act of not disposing of trash can be seen as a minor social faux pas. It's not a criminal act, but it's inconsiderate. The key here is whether it's considered wrong socially. \n\nOn one hand, the argument is that it's the theater's responsibility. On the other, it's a shared space, and everyone should contribute to keeping it clean. The friend's reaction suggests that there's a differing opinion here. \n\nSo, considering all factors, even though there's a counterpoint about the cleaning staff, the general expectation is to dispose of trash properly in public places. Therefore, the person is likely in the wrong.\n"
