But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person says they were raised that way, did it at the mall and sports events, but a friend scolded them. They now throw away their stuff but are conflicted because they think the theaters have cleaners and it's expensive to go there. They don't want to be an asshole and are asking for input.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me break this down. The main points are the person's habits, the friend's reaction, and the reasoning they provide. \n\nFirst, the person is not littering; they just aren't disposing of their trash in the theater's bins. So, they're leaving their waste behind. The friend called them out on it. Now, the user is asking if the person is at fault.\n\nTheaters are public spaces where people expect cleanliness. Leaving trash around, even if there are cleaners, can contribute to a messier environment. It might also set a bad example for others. However, the person argues that theaters are expensive and that cleaners handle it. But that's not an excuse for not taking responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the person might have grown up in a different culture where this was acceptable. But societal norms often require individuals to follow the expected behavior in public places. Leaving trash isn't just about convenience; it's about consideration for others and shared spaces. \n\nEven if the theater has staff, it's still a matter of personal responsibility and courtesy. If everyone left their trash, the theaters would be much worse off. The person might not be a complete jerk, but they are contributing to a problem that others have to clean up. \n\nSo, considering that, the person is in the wrong for not disposing of their trash properly, even if the friend's reaction was perhaps a bit harsh. The right thing to do is to use the bins provided. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance here. Let me check again. The person does say they now throw away their stuff, so they are trying to adjust. But the question is about the initial action. \n\nThe key is whether leaving trash in the theater is inherently wrong. Since public spaces require everyone to contribute to cleanliness, not doing so is inconsiderate. So, the answer is A.\n"
