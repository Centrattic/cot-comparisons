      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions their family culture, friends' reactions, and their reasoning about cleaners and costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Generally, people are expected to clean up after themselves, especially in shared environments like theaters. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate because it creates extra work for staff and can be a hassle for other patrons. The author's friend even called them out, which suggests that their friend sees it as a problem.\n\nThe author argues that there are people to clean the theaters and that it's expensive to go there. But just because there are cleaners doesn't mean individuals shouldn't help out. If everyone left their trash, the workload for staff would increase significantly. Also, the cost of the movie ticket doesn't excuse not cleaning up; it's about responsibility and respect for the environment and others.\n\nThe size of the theater is mentioned as seating 30 people. Even a small number of people leaving trash can add up, especially if multiple screenings happen. The author might think it's trivial, but inconsiderate actions can accumulate. The fact that they feel conflicted but still did it might indicate they're aware it's not the best choice.\n\nHowever, the author isn't causing direct harm; they're just not cleaning up. It's a matter of social etiquette rather than a legal or moral wrong. Some might argue that it's a minor issue, but in a public setting, maintaining cleanliness is a shared responsibility. The person's friend's reaction shows that social norms in their friend's perspective do matter.\n\nSo, balancing the arguments: the author's reasoning isn't entirely wrong because they're not breaking any rules, but socially, it's expected to clean up. Since they were chided by a friend, it's a sign that their action crossed a social boundary. Therefore, they are in the wrong for not cleaning up, even if it's a minor offense.\n"
