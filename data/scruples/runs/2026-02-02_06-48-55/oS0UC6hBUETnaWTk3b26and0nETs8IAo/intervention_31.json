But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They mention their family's culture and that others might clean up after them. The friend called them out, but the author feels it's not a big deal because there are cleaners and the theaters are small.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the social norms here. In most public places, especially where people pay to enter, leaving trash behind is generally frowned upon. Even if there are cleaners, it's considered polite to dispose of your own trash. Theaters rely on a good experience for customers, and leaving mess could affect others. Plus, the argument about cost\u2014maybe they pay a lot to see a movie, but that doesn't negate the responsibility to keep the space clean. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that there are people to clean, but that's a common excuse. If everyone left their trash, the cleaners would have a bigger job, and maybe more importantly, it creates a mess for others sitting there. The friend's reaction is a sign that others do care. The author tried to justify it by saying it's not a big task, but even small contributions add up. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author isn't causing direct harm, but the question is about being in the wrong. Socially, it's expected to clean up after oneself. So even if they don't feel it's a huge issue, the act of leaving trash is considered impolite. So the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because they're not following social expectations of cleanliness and consideration for others and staff.\n"
