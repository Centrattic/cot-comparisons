But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They mention that their family's culture was to leave things in places like malls or stadiums, but a friend criticized them after a movie. The person argues that theaters have staff to clean, and since they're small (like 30 seats), it's not a big deal. They also mention the high cost of movies.\n\nSo, first, the main question is whether leaving trash in the theater is wrong. Let's consider different angles. From a public responsibility standpoint, littering is generally discouraged because it creates more work for staff and a less pleasant environment for others. However, the person's reasoning is that the staff is there to clean up anyway. But even if someone else will clean it, it's still a consideration for others sitting in the theater after them. Imagine going to a movie and finding trash left behind\u2014it might be annoying.\n\nOn the other hand, the person doesn't feel entirely wrong because the cost is high. Maybe they feel they paid for a certain experience and shouldn't have to do extra. But that's a stretch. Paying for a ticket doesn't give them the right to leave a mess. Also, the argument that the theater is small and cleaning isn't a big task might not hold. Even a small amount of trash can be disruptive.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the social norm in the friend's view is to clean up after oneself. So there's a conflict between the person's family habits and the expectations of others. The person is now conflicted, trying to balance their habits with social expectations.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, if the act of not cleaning up is causing inconvenience or disrespect to others, then maybe yes. But some might argue it's a minor issue. However, generally, being considerate of shared spaces is a social norm. Even if there's cleaning staff, it's polite to take responsibility for your own waste. So I think the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they're contributing to a less pleasant environment for others, even if the theater has staff. The cost of the ticket isn't a valid excuse. It's a small effort to dispose of trash properly, showing respect for others and the space.\n"
