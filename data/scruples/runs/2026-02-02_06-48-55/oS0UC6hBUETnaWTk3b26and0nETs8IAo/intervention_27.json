But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The original post mentions that they grew up with a culture where they didn't clean up after themselves in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Now, their friend reprimanded them, and they're conflicted because they feel it's not a big deal since theaters have staff to clean up, and going to the movies is expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In most places, it's considered polite to dispose of your trash properly. Leaving it around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. Public spaces are shared, so keeping them clean is a social responsibility. The argument that it's not a big task because there's staff might not hold up because it's about respect for others and the environment. Also, the cost of the movie ticket doesn't absolve someone from basic etiquette. \n\nThe author's friend was upset, which indicates that the friend found it unacceptable. The author's reasoning about upbringing might explain their behavior but doesn't necessarily justify it. Social norms can evolve, and even if someone was raised differently, adapting to current expectations is usually expected when in public. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't the only one responsible. Theaters do have cleaning staff, but that doesn't mean individuals shouldn't contribute. It's a shared responsibility. The author's admission that they don't want to be an asshole suggests they care about others' opinions, so not taking the friend's feedback seriously could be seen as dismissive.\n\nBut there's also the point about the theater's capacity. If it's only 30 people, maybe the amount of trash isn't overwhelming. Still, the principle remains. The cost of the movie being high doesn't mean you can ignore the rules of social conduct. If everyone left their trash, it would create a bigger problem. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions are inconsiderate. Even if they were raised differently, adult life often requires adjusting to societal expectations. The friend's reaction shows that the behavior is socially frowned upon. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
