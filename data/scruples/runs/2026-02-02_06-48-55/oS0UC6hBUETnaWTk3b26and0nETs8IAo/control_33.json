But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions their family's culture of not cleaning up in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. They were scolded by a friend but argue that there are cleaners and that movie theaters aren't too crowded now, so maybe it's not a big deal. They're worried about being an asshole and want to know if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around cleaning up after oneself in public spaces. Generally, people are expected to dispose of their trash properly. Leaving trash behind can be considered inconsiderate, especially in shared spaces. Theaters have limited capacity now, but even if there are cleaners, it's part of the experience to leave the place as you found it. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes the cost of going to the movies as a factor, but that doesn't justify not cleaning up. The presence of cleaning staff doesn't negate the social expectation to dispose of trash. Even if the theater isn't full, leaving trash contributes to a messier environment and adds to the workload of the staff. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction indicates that this behavior is not socially acceptable to them. The author's family culture might differ, but societal norms are broader than family practices. Being considerate of others' experiences and the cleanliness of shared spaces is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't causing direct harm, just not cleaning up. But in public areas, small actions can have cumulative effects. While the author isn't an \"asshole,\" they might be in the wrong for not following the expected norm. The answer would likely be A, yes, they are in the wrong because they didn't dispose of their trash despite knowing it's expected.\n"
