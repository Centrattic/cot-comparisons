Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away empty drink and popcorn at the movies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author mentions their family culture, where they don't dispose of trash in places like malls or stadiums. They justify it by saying there are cleaners and that movie theaters are expensive. They also feel conflicted because they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, leaving trash behind is generally considered inconsiderate. Public places expect people to clean up after themselves. Even if there are cleaners, it adds to their workload unnecessarily. People often pay for convenience, but that doesn't mean they should avoid basic etiquette.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that the theaters have many seats and the cost of going to the movies is high. However, the cost doesn't necessarily excuse not cleaning up. The presence of cleaning staff doesn't mean it's acceptable to leave trash; it's still a courtesy to others in the space.\n\nI think the key here is social norms and respect for shared spaces. Even if it's not a huge burden for cleaners, it's a matter of personal responsibility. Leaving trash behind can be seen as lazy or inconsiderate, regardless of the venue's size or cost. So, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not following a common courtesy that others expect.\n"
