      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that their family's culture was to leave stuff in certain public places like malls and stadiums, but their friend scolded them after the movie. Now they're conflicted because they think the theaters have staff to clean, plus the cost of going to the theater is high, but they don't want to be seen as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public places. Generally, people are expected to clean up after themselves in public spaces, even if there are janitors. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate to others and adds to the workload of the cleaning staff. However, the author's reasoning is that there are people to clean, and the theaters are expensive. But does that justify not cleaning up?\n\nThe friend's reaction is a key point here. If a friend called them out, that might indicate a social expectation they're not meeting. The author's family's habits might be different, but moving to a new cultural norm (like cleaning up) could be necessary in different settings. Also, the argument that the theaters seat 30 people now (presumably smaller due to pandemic measures?) might mean less space and more discomfort if trash is left around. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not directly harming anyone, just not cleaning up. The main issue is social etiquette and respect for shared spaces. Even if there's a cleaning crew, contributing to a cleaner environment is usually encouraged. The cost of the ticket doesn't directly relate to the responsibility of cleaning up one's trash. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be a complete asshole, but they are being inconsiderate. The answer would likely be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the general expectation is to dispose of trash properly, regardless of cleaning staff. However, the situation isn't extreme, so maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) if the focus is on the existence of staff. But usually, social norms prioritize individual responsibility in public places. So leaning towards A.\n"
