But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains they grew up with a culture where they didn't discard trash in public places like malls or stadiums, but their friend criticized them. They mention that theaters have people who clean up, and since theaters are now smaller (like 30 people), it's not a big task. They also note the high cost of going to theaters.\n\nHmm, first, the main issue is whether leaving trash in the theater is wrong. On one hand, the author's reasoning is that there are cleaners and the theater isn't too crowded, so maybe the impact isn't huge. They also feel the cost makes them justify it. But the friend is upset, so maybe social norms are different here.\n\nI need to consider hygiene and respect for shared spaces. Even if there are cleaners, leaving trash around can be unsanitary and disrespectful to them. Theaters are public places, and everyone should take responsibility to keep them clean. The argument that it's not a big task because of fewer people doesn't hold if we consider that cleanliness affects all patrons. Also, the cost of admission doesn't negate the responsibility to clean up after oneself. \n\nThe author's friend called them out, which suggests that in their friend's view, it's expected to dispose of trash properly. While personal habits and upbringing matter, social norms in public spaces generally require people to clean up. So, even if the author isn't the worst, there's a responsibility to follow basic courtesy. Theaters might have staff, but that's not a reason to avoid doing the right thing. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some people don't mind a little trash, especially if it's minimal. But the key is whether it's considered acceptable in society. Most public places expect you to dispose of your trash, regardless of the presence of cleaners. Leaving it could contribute to a messier environment and make the cleaners' jobs harder. The cost of going to the theater is a personal financial issue and doesn't justify not cleaning up. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow the expected social norm of cleaning up after themselves in a public space. The justifications about cleaners and cost don't outweigh the basic courtesy expected in such places. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
