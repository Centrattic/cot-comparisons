But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The person's friend scolded them, but they argue that there are cleaners and it's expensive to go to the movies these days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around public spaces. In most places, it's generally expected to clean up after yourself. Leaving trash in movie theaters could be seen as inconsiderate because it affects the experience for others and adds work for staff. However, the author mentions their family's culture and that they do clean up in some places like the mall food court. But they didn't do it at the movie theater this time.\n\nThe argument about cleaners is valid to some extent. However, relying on staff to clean up after everyone might contribute to their workload. Even if the theater isn't very full, leaving trash isn't ideal. The cost of the ticket isn't really a justification for littering. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is reflecting and trying to be considerate, which is a good sign. They did clean up after being told, showing they're not intentionally inconsiderate. But the initial action was still leaving trash behind. \n\nSo, is it wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say it's not a huge issue because there are cleaners, but others would say it's a basic courtesy. The friend's reaction suggests that in their view, it's important. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A, but B could be argued too. However, in most social contexts, cleaning up after oneself is expected, so the answer is likely A.\n"
