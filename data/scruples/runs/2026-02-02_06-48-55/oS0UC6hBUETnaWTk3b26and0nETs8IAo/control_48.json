      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The original post says that the author's friend chastised them for it, but the author argues that there are people who clean the theaters, and since theaters now seat around 30 people, it's not a big task. They also mention that movie tickets are expensive and they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's common to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Leaving trash behind, even if there are cleaners, is often seen as inconsiderate. The idea is that even though there are people to clean up, it's better to leave the space as clean as possible for others. So maybe the author is expected to throw away their trash, even if it's not strictly necessary for them to do so.\n\nThen there's the argument about the number of people. If each movie theater seats 30 people, but there might be multiple showings and many theaters, the amount of trash could add up. However, the author's point is that it's not a big task for the cleaners. But even if it's not a huge burden, the social expectation might still be to do it as a courtesy.\n\nAnother angle is the cost of going to the theater. The author says it's expensive, so they might feel they paid for a service and thus the cleanup is part of that. But that's a bit of a stretch. Paying for a ticket doesn't necessarily mean you get to leave a mess behind; the service includes the cleaning provided by the staff, but that doesn't negate the social expectation of being considerate.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. The author's friend was upset, which suggests that in their view, leaving trash is wrong. The author's family culture might differ, but when interacting with others, it's often better to adapt to the broader social norm unless there's a strong reason not to.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong. The social norm in most public spaces is to clean up after yourself, even if there are cleaners. The argument about cleaners is a common one, but it's about respect for others and maintaining a clean environment. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't follow the expected etiquette, even if their reasoning has some validity.\n"
