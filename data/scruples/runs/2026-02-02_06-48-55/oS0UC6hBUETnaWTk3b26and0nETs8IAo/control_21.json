Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were raised to leave trash in places like movie theaters, malls, and stadiums. Their friend recently scolded them, so now they're questioning their actions. The author argues that there are cleaners to handle the waste, and since movie tickets are expensive, maybe it's not their responsibility. They also note that theaters now have smaller seating capacities, making cleanup easier.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and expectations. In most public places, especially in areas where people pay to be, leaving trash is generally frowned upon. Even if there are cleaners, littering is considered impolite and unhygienic. The fact that the friend called them out suggests that the norm in their social circle expects people to clean up after themselves. The author's reasoning about cleaners and cost doesn't negate the expectation of personal responsibility in maintaining cleanliness. \n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint. If the theater has staff to clean up, maybe the impact is minimal. But that's a bit like saying, \"Someone else will take care of it,\" which is a common excuse. The social contract usually requires individuals to contribute to the cleanliness of shared spaces. Leaving trash might inconvenience others and set a bad example. \n\nThe author is conflicted between their upbringing and social etiquette. While their culture allowed this behavior, social norms in many places do expect people to dispose of their trash. The key here is that even if it's not a huge task for cleaners, it's still considered courteous to do so. So, the author might be in the wrong because they're not following the expected social norm, even if their reasoning has some validity.\n"
