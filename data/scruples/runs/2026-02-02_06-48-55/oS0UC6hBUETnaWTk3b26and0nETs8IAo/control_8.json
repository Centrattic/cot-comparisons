      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that in their family, they didn't do that at places like the mall food court, stadiums, or theaters. However, a friend criticized them after a movie when they did throw it away. The author's reasoning is that theaters have people who clean up, and since the seating is small (30 people), it's not a big task. They also mention the high cost of going to theaters as a reason not to feel bad. They want to know if they're an asshole for not cleaning up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, public spaces expect people to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash in movie theaters, especially when there are designated areas for disposal, is usually seen as inconsiderate. Movie theaters are shared spaces where other people will sit in those seats after you, so leaving trash could make the experience less pleasant for others. The author's argument that there are cleaners is a bit weak because the presence of cleaners doesn't mean individuals should contribute to the mess. It's a matter of consideration and respect for others.\n\nThe author's reasoning about the seating capacity being small (30 people) might not hold because even a small number of people can create a significant amount of waste if everyone doesn't dispose of their trash. Also, the cost of going to the theater doesn't justify not following basic etiquette. The friend's criticism points out that the author's actions were noticeable and perhaps off-putting. \n\nHowever, the author isn't being malicious; they came from a different family culture. But personal habits shouldn't override public etiquette. The key here is whether the action is considered inconsiderate. Even if it's not illegal, social norms often dictate that we should clean up after ourselves in public. So, the author might be in the wrong for not disposing of their trash, even if they didn't mean to be inconsiderate. The fact that they did throw it away the next time suggests they are open to feedback, but the initial action still reflects a disregard for communal cleanliness.\n"
