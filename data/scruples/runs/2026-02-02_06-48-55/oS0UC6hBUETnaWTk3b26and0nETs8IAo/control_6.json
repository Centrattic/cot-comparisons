Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They mention that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, and they left trash in places like malls and stadiums. A friend scolded them, and now they're wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The user's family might have different habits, but in many places, it's considered polite to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Movie theaters, in particular, can get crowded, and leaving trash might make the environment uncomfortable for others. Even if there are cleaning staff, the responsibility to maintain a clean space is usually shared by everyone.\n\nThe argument that it's expensive to go to the theater is a bit of a stretch. The cost of admission doesn't exempt someone from basic courtesy. People pay for the experience, which includes a clean and comfortable environment for all patrons. Also, the size of the theater (30 seats) doesn't matter because even a small number of people can create a mess if everyone leaves their trash.\n\nThe user might feel conflicted because their friend criticized them. It's possible they're trying to adjust their behavior to be more considerate. However, justifying the action by saying there are people to clean up is a common excuse. The presence of cleaning staff doesn't negate personal responsibility in public spaces. It's about being respectful towards others and the shared space.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user might not be a complete \"asshole,\" they are in the wrong for not cleaning up. The correct answer would be A.\n"
