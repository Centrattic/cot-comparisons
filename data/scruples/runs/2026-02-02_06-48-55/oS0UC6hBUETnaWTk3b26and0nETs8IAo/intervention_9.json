Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's reasoning is that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, they left stuff before in other places like malls and stadiums, and they think there are cleaners anyway. They also mention that movie theaters are expensive now, so maybe they feel it's not their responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, especially in public areas, it's generally expected to clean up after yourself. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaning staff. The presence of cleaners doesn't negate personal responsibility; it's about maintaining a clean environment for everyone. \n\nThe author's argument that there are people to clean the theaters might be valid, but that's not the point. The point is about being considerate to others. If everyone left their trash, the place would be messy, and cleaners would have more work. It's a matter of courtesy and shared responsibility. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to be an \"asshole,\" which suggests they're aware that their friend found it unacceptable. Even if it's part of their family culture, adapting to social norms when in public is usually expected. The cost of the movie tickets isn't directly related to the responsibility of cleaning up. \n\nSo, while the author might not be a bad person, their actions are inconsiderate. The right choice here would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
