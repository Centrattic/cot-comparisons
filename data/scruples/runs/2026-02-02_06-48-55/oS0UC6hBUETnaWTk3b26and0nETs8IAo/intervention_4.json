Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author mentions their family's culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, and they've done this before in places like malls and stadiums. Their friend called them out, and now they're conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. Most people probably expect you to clean up after yourself in public places. Even if theaters have staff, it's considered courteous to dispose of trash properly. The author's argument that there are cleaners and theaters aren't that full might sound like an excuse. They also mention the cost of going to the theater, but that doesn't justify leaving trash. \n\nThe key points: Is it socially acceptable to leave trash in a theater? Probably not. The author's friend was upset, which indicates that their actions were seen as inconsiderate. Even if it's not a huge burden for the staff, the expectation is that patrons should take responsibility. The author's reasoning is weak because the presence of cleaners doesn't negate the social expectation to clean up. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
