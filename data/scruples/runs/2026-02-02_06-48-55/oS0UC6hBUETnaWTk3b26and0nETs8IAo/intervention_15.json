But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up after themselves in public places like malls or stadiums, but their friend scolded them after a movie. The author now throws away their trash but is conflicted because they think movie theaters have staff to clean up and that it's expensive to go to the movies now. They also don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most public places, especially in the US, it's generally expected that you dispose of your own trash. Leaving it for others to clean up can be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reasoning that there are people to clean the theaters might be true, but relying on others to clean up after you is generally frowned upon. It's a matter of personal responsibility and respect for shared spaces.\n\nThe author's point about the cost of going to the theater is a bit of a red herring. The expense doesn't justify not cleaning up. People pay for the experience, which includes a clean environment. The number of people in the theater (30) might not seem like a lot, but leaving trash around still contributes to a mess that others have to deal with. Even if it's a small task, it's a task that should be done collectively by everyone, not left to staff or others.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a social cue that the author's behavior was outside the accepted norm. The author is now trying to reconcile their habits with societal expectations. The key here is that while the author isn't the only one responsible for cleaning, they are individually responsible for their own trash. The argument that \"there are people to clean up\" is a common one but doesn't negate personal responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. They should have disposed of their trash as it's a basic courtesy in public spaces. The fact that they did it before and didn't face consequences doesn't mean it's acceptable. The friend's feedback is a valid point, and the author's reasoning about costs and cleaning staff doesn't hold up in terms of social etiquette.\n"
