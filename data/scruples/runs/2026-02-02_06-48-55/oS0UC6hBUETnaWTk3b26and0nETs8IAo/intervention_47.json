Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote about not throwing away their trash in the movie theater is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that in their family, they didn't dispose of trash in public places like malls or stadiums. But their friend called them out, and now they're conflicted. They argue that theater cleaners handle the mess, and since tickets are expensive, it's understandable not to clean up. However, they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nI need to consider social norms. In most public places, leaving trash is frowned upon. Even if there are cleaners, it's polite to dispose of your own waste. Theaters, especially with capacity limits now, might have fewer people, but responsibility still lies with individuals. The cost of tickets doesn't absolve someone from basic courtesy. Plus, being considerate of others' experiences matters. If everyone left trash, the environment would be worse. The author's friend's reaction is a sign that this behavior is seen as inconsiderate. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
