      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The user wants an answer of A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author says they grew up with a family culture of not cleaning up in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. After a movie, a friend criticized them, so they complied but still feel it's not a big deal. They argue that theaters have staff to clean, and since theaters are expensive, it's not their responsibility. They're worried about being seen as an asshole and want to know if they're wrong.\n\nNow, considering societal norms. In many places, it's considered polite and respectful to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate to others and the staff. However, the author's reasoning includes the point that there are cleaners. But even if someone else is going to clean up, it's still a matter of personal responsibility and consideration. Leaving trash might make the space less pleasant for others until it's cleaned.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that in their view, the author was wrong. The author's defense is that it's not a big task, but that's a bit dismissive. The scale of the task doesn't negate the act of being considerate. Also, the cost of going to the theater doesn't justify leaving mess; it's about being respectful regardless of the expense.\n\nThere's also the aspect of social expectations. While the author's family culture is different, when interacting with others outside their family, social norms can vary. The friend's disapproval indicates that in that social context, the author's actions were seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, even though there are cleaners, the norm is to dispose of trash properly. The author's actions might be seen as not following social etiquette, hence being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
