      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that this is a family culture, they do it at malls and stadiums too, but a friend called them out. Now they're conflicted because they feel like there are cleaners, and it's expensive to go to the movies, but they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most public places, especially in the US, it's customary to clean up after yourself. Leaving trash behind is generally considered inconsiderate. Theaters, like other public spaces, rely on staff to clean, but that doesn't necessarily absolve individuals from taking responsibility. Even if there are people cleaning, leaving trash makes their job harder and might be seen as disrespectful to their labor.\n\nThe author argues that since theaters seat around 30 people now, it's not a big task. But even a small number of people leaving trash can accumulate over time. Also, the cost of going to the movies being high doesn't justify not cleaning up. Those are separate issues. The friend pointing it out suggests that the social norm in their circle is to dispose of trash properly.\n\nFamily culture is a factor, but that doesn't override general societal expectations. If the author's behavior is at odds with the broader social norm, they might be the one in the wrong. However, some might argue that the theater's responsibility to clean negates the need for individuals to do so. But that's a bit of a stretch because maintaining cleanliness is a shared responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is in the minority in their habits, it's possible they are being inconsiderate. The key here is whether the act of leaving trash is seen as acceptable. In most contexts, it's not. So even if the author feels it's minor, others might perceive it as inconsiderate. The friend's reaction indicates that there's a social expectation to dispose of trash, so the author's actions might be violating that expectation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
