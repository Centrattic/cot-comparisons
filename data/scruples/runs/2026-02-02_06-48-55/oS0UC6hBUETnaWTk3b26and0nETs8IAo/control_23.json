But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person explains that they grew up in a culture where they didn't dispose of their trash in public places like malls or stadiums, but after a friend criticized them, they did throw it away this time. They also mention that theaters have staff who clean up, and since they paid a lot to go to the movies, they might not feel responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's considered polite to dispose of your own trash, especially in public places. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. The argument that others will clean up is common, but it's about respecting shared spaces and not adding to the workload of staff unnecessarily. \n\nThe person's reasoning about the cost of going to the theater might not hold up in terms of social responsibility. Even if it's expensive, it's part of being a respectful member of a community to contribute to keeping the environment clean. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a social cue that maybe the person's behavior isn't aligned with what others expect. The fact that the person changed their behavior after being called out suggests they are aware of this, but they're still questioning whether they were wrong. \n\nHowever, the person isn't being malicious; they're just coming from a different cultural background. But cultural norms can vary, and in this case, the friend's perspective seems to be the more widely accepted one in modern society, especially in settings like movie theaters where cleanliness is important for the experience of others. \n\nSo, while the person isn't a \"bigot\" or an \"asshole,\" they might still be in the wrong because leaving trash behind is generally considered impolite. The presence of staff doesn't negate personal responsibility for cleanliness in public spaces. Therefore, the answer is likely that they are in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
