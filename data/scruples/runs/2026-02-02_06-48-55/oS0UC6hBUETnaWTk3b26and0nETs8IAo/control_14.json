Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The friend criticized them, but the author argues that there are cleaners and it's expensive to go to the theater.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider cultural norms. The author mentions their family's culture where they dispose of trash in some places but not others, like movie theaters. But the friend disagrees. So, there's a difference in expectations here.\n\nThen, the author's reasoning: cleaners are available, so maybe it's not necessary. But even if there are cleaners, leaving trash could still be considered rude. Movie theaters are public spaces, and keeping trash in your seat or area might be messy for others. Also, the author notes that theaters have limited seating now (30 people), implying maybe smaller spaces. So, even a small amount of trash might be more noticeable or cause more inconvenience.\n\nExpensive tickets don't justify not cleaning up. Whether you pay a lot or not, being considerate is part of being a good guest. Theaters have rules for a reason, and following them is about respect, not cost.\n\nAlso, the author doesn't want to be an asshole. If the friend is upset, that's a sign that maybe the author's actions were off-putting. Even if the theater has cleaners, leaving trash around can reflect poorly on your behavior. People might find it inconsiderate, regardless of the actual cleanup process.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily breaking a law, social etiquette likely expects them to dispose of their trash. The argument about cleaners and cost doesn't negate the expectation of personal responsibility in public spaces. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
