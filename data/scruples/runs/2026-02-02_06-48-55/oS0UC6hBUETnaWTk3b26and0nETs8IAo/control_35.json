Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The friend criticized them, but the author feels it's not a big deal because there are cleaners and movie theaters are expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. In many places, it's expected to clean up after yourself in public spaces, even if there are staff to do it. Leaving trash behind is generally seen as inconsiderate. The author's family culture might have taught them differently, but that doesn't necessarily excuse it in a public setting. \n\nThen, the cost of the theater isn't a direct factor here. People pay for their tickets and snacks, but the responsibility to dispose of trash is different. It's about being respectful to the environment and the place. Theaters do have cleaning staff, but relying on them to handle everyone's trash without contributing can be seen as not doing your part. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to be an asshole. If the friend is upset, that's a sign that their action was perceived as rude. Even if the author doesn't think it's a big task, it's a small effort that can prevent others from having to deal with the mess. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The correct answer would be A.\n"
