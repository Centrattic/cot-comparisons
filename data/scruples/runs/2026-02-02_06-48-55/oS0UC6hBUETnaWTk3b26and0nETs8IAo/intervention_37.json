But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The person explains that they grew up in a culture where they didn't clean up after themselves in places like malls or sports stadiums. However, their friend criticized them for this after a movie. The person defends their action by saying that there are people who clean the theaters, the theaters are small with 30 seats, so it's not much work, and that movie tickets are expensive now. They also mention not wanting to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural background they mentioned. If their family's culture is different, maybe they didn't learn to clean up in public spaces. But is that a valid excuse? Maybe not, because societal norms often require adapting to the environment, even if personal habits differ. \n\nThen, their argument about cleaners is a common one. They argue that since there are janitors, it's not their responsibility. But that's a bit of a slippery slope. If everyone thinks that way, the burden on cleaners increases, and the environment becomes messier. Plus, maintaining public spaces requires collective responsibility. Even if the theater is small, contributing to keeping it clean is part of being considerate.\n\nThey also mention the cost of going to the theater. That's a bit of a red herring. The cost of the ticket doesn't directly relate to whether one should clean up. Even if it's expensive, the expectation is still to follow basic etiquette. \n\nThe person is conflicted because they don't want to be seen as an asshole. But the act of not cleaning up could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the person isn't malicious. It's a matter of social responsibility. In public spaces, people generally expect others to clean up after themselves to maintain order and hygiene. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's some flexibility. If the theater doesn't have strict policies, maybe the person isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the friend's reaction suggests that in their social circle, this behavior is frowned upon. The person might need to adjust their habits to fit in better, even if their upbringing was different.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the person's actions, while perhaps influenced by their background, are still inconsiderate in a public setting. The defense about cleaners and cost doesn't hold up because it's about shared responsibility and basic courtesy. Therefore, the person is in the wrong.\n"
