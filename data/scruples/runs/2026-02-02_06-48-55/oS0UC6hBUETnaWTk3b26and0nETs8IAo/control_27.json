But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's reasoning is that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, they've done it at other places like malls and stadiums, and they feel it's not a big deal since theaters have staff to clean. They also mention the high cost of going to the movies.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to assess if the action is objectively wrong. In most public places, especially places with high turnover like theaters, it's considered polite to dispose of your trash properly. Leaving it behind can create a mess for others and for the cleaning staff. The author's argument is that there are cleaners, but even so, it's a matter of respect and responsibility. \n\nAlso, the author's friend called them out, which suggests that in some social circles, this is seen as inconsiderate. The cost of the movie isn't really a valid reason to leave trash; that's more about justifying the expense rather than the behavior. \n\nThe author's point about small theaters seating 30 people might be a stretch. Even in smaller venues, people are expected to clean up after themselves. While it's true that staff will eventually clean, it's still inconsiderate to make them do extra work. \n\nSo, considering social norms and etiquette, the author is likely in the wrong. The fact that they had to be reminded by a friend also indicates that their behavior is not aligned with what others expect. Even if their family didn't teach them that, societal expectations generally require cleaning up after oneself. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
