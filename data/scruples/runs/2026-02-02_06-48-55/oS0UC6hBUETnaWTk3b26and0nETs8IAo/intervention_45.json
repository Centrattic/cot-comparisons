Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't throw away their trash at the movie theater is in the wrong. The person's reasoning is that their family didn't do that, others leave trash too, and since theaters have staff to clean, it's not a big deal. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most public places, like theaters, it's expected to dispose of your trash properly. Leaving it behind might be seen as inconsiderate, even if others do it. The friend's reaction suggests that there's a social expectation here that the author isn't meeting.\n\nThe author's argument about staff cleaning is a common one. However, relying on staff to clean up after everyone can lead to more work for them, even if it's not \"a big task.\" It's about respecting shared spaces and contributing to a clean environment. Plus, if everyone left their trash, the situation would be worse. \n\nThe cost of the movie isn't a valid justification. The expense doesn't negate the responsibility to maintain cleanliness. Also, the author mentions not wanting to be an asshole, which indicates they're aware that their actions could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nWhile the author isn't the only one doing this, it doesn't make it right. Social norms are about collective behavior, and individual actions contribute to the overall environment. Even small actions, like throwing away trash, help maintain a pleasant experience for everyone.\n\nSo, even though there's some understanding of the author's perspective, the act of not disposing of trash in a public place where it's expected is inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
