      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that they grew up with a culture where they dispose of trash in certain places like the mall food court but not at places like football stadiums or movie theaters. Their friend scolded them after a recent movie, and now they're wondering if they're an a**hole. They argue that theaters have staff to clean up, and since theaters now have smaller capacities (30 people), it's not a big task. They also mention that going to the movies is expensive, so maybe they feel justified in not contributing to the cleaning effort. But they don't want to be an a**hole.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about social norms, responsibility, and maybe the impact on others. On one hand, it's true that theaters have staff to clean up. But in public spaces, people are generally expected to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind can create clutter, which might make the environment less pleasant for others, even if someone else will eventually clean up. Plus, the cost of cleaning might be factored into ticket prices, so not contributing could be seen as not taking personal responsibility.\n\nThe user's argument that theaters seat 30 people now might be a stretch. Even if it's a small number, each person contributing to the cleanup would make it easier. Also, cultural habits can vary, but social norms in many places do encourage people to dispose of their trash properly. The friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is not acceptable in their social circle, which could lead to social friction.\n\nHowever, the user isn't being malicious; they're just following what they learned growing up. They are also open to feedback and are trying to adjust. So maybe there's a learning curve here. The question is whether not cleaning up is objectively wrong or if it's a matter of differing expectations.\n\nIn some places, like stadiums, it's common for staff to handle trash, but theaters might expect patrons to dispose of their own trash. The user's reasoning that others will clean up might not apply here because theaters typically provide trash bins for that purpose. Leaving trash behind ignores the facilities provided and the expectations of others around them.\n\nSo considering all that, the user is not necessarily in the wrong in a strict sense, but their behavior does go against common social expectations. They might be in the wrong in the context of their friend's values and the general expectation in public spaces to clean up after oneself. The answer could lean towards A (yes) because the norm is to dispose of trash, even if someone else eventually does the cleaning. Alternatively, if the norm isn't strongly enforced, maybe B (no). But given the friend's reaction and the general societal expectation, I think the answer is A.\n"
