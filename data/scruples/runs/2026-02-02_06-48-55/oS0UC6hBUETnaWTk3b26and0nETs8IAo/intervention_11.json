But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author didn't throw away their empty drink and popcorn after the movie. Their friend scolded them, and now they're wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their family's culture didn't emphasize cleaning up after themselves in public places like malls, stadiums, and movie theaters. They argue that there are cleaners, and since theaters now have fewer seats (like 30), it's not a big task. Plus, going to the theater is expensive, so maybe they feel like they paid for the experience and the cleanup is part of the service. However, they acknowledge they threw it away this time but are conflicted.\n\nSo, the question is whether this is a moral wrong. On one hand, public etiquette usually expects people to dispose of their trash properly. Leaving it around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if others clean up. It's about shared spaces and respect for others. On the other hand, the author's reasoning includes practical aspects\u2014cleaners exist, the cost of going to the theater, and maybe not seeing it as a big deal if others handle it.\n\nBut societal norms often prioritize personal responsibility. Even if someone else cleans up, leaving trash can be a sign of disrespect. The fact that their friend called them out suggests that in some social circles, this is considered important. Also, the argument that it's not a big task because of fewer seats might not hold\u2014public places are for many people, and everyone contributing to cleanliness helps maintain a pleasant environment for all.\n\nThe author's family culture is part of their reasoning, but just because it's a personal habit doesn't necessarily make it right. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, and I'm supposed to see if that's the case. Considering that the friend felt the need to address it, and the general expectation of public responsibility, I lean towards the author being in the wrong. So, Answer A.\n"
