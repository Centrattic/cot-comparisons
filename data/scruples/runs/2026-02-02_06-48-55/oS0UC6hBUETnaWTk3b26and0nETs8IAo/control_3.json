      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that this is a habit from their family's culture, and they've done it in places like malls and stadiums. Their friend criticized them after a movie, but they don't feel wrong because there are people who clean the theaters, and they think it's not a big deal since there are only 30 seats now. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Generally, people are expected to clean up after themselves in shared spaces to maintain cleanliness and respect for others. Theaters, like other public places, probably have policies about this. Even if the cleaning staff is available, leaving trash around can make the area dirtier for others and might add unnecessary work for the staff. \n\nThe author's argument is that since there are cleaners, maybe it's not their responsibility. But that's a common argument. However, expecting others to clean up after you can be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the size of the theater (30 seats) might not matter because even a small space can benefit from everyone doing their part. The cost of the movie isn't directly related to the responsibility of cleaning, though it's a valid point about the value they get for the price. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the norm in their social circle is to dispose of trash properly. The author might be in a cultural conflict here. But societal expectations generally lean towards cleaning up after oneself in public. So even if the author's family taught them otherwise, societal norms might place them in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the author does throw away the trash after being reminded, which shows a willingness to comply. Also, they're asking if they're an asshole, which suggests they're aware it might be a problem. But the act of not cleaning up initially could still be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI need to balance the cultural background against general societal expectations. While personal habits are part of one's upbringing, public spaces require shared responsibility. The cleaning staff's job is to maintain the space, but it's still courteous to assist by disposing of trash properly. So, the author might be in the wrong for not doing so, even if others clean up later. The key point is about respecting others' experiences and the environment.\n"
