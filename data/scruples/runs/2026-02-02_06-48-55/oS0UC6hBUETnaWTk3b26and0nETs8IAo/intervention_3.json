But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The author's friend scolded them, but the author argues that theaters have staff to clean up and that it's expensive to go to the movies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms of public spaces. Generally, people are expected to clean up after themselves, especially in places like theaters where others will use the same seats after. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. Theaters might have staff, but it's still a courtesy to others. Also, the cost of the ticket doesn't justify not cleaning up. It's about respect for the environment and fellow patrons. The author's reasoning that it's not a big task because the theater seats 30 people is a bit off because even a small number of people can create enough trash. Plus, making it easier for workers to do their job is part of being considerate. So, the author might be wrong because they're not following a common social norm of cleaning up after oneself, regardless of the presence of staff. However, some might argue that the staff is there for that exact purpose, but the general etiquette still leans towards taking responsibility. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
