Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. They mention their family's culture of not cleaning up in public places like malls or stadiums. A friend scolded them, but they argue that theaters have cleaners, and it's expensive to go to the movies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether leaving trash is wrong. Public places usually expect people to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. It adds to their workload and might affect the environment. However, the person's reasoning includes that theaters have staff and it's pricey to attend. But that doesn't excuse not cleaning up. There's a social norm of being considerate, and even if it's not a big task, contributing to cleanliness is a small act of respect. The friend's reaction suggests that the person's behavior was out of line. So the answer might be A, but I need to balance the arguments. The user doesn't want to be an asshole, so the right choice is to clean up. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
