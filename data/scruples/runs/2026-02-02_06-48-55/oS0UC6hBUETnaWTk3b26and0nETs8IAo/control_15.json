Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, and they've done this before at places like malls and stadiums. A friend scolded them, but the author argues that theaters have cleaners and it's not a big deal, especially since movie tickets are expensive.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether leaving trash in a movie theater is wrong. On one hand, it's a public space, and leaving trash might be considered inconsiderate. People expect to have a clean environment, and even if there are cleaners, it's a shared space. Plus, theaters might have rules about cleaning up after yourself. On the other hand, the author's reasoning is that it's not a huge burden on the staff and that they're paying a lot for the experience. \n\nBut I think the social norm here is that you're supposed to clean up your own mess, even if there are cleaners. Leaving trash around can be seen as lazy or disrespectful. The author's friend was upset, which suggests that others do find it offensive. While it's understandable that the author has a different upbringing, adapting to social expectations is usually expected when interacting with others. So, even if the author's actions don't cause significant harm, the social expectation is to dispose of trash properly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, but maybe not a huge one. Answer A.\n"
