Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at a movie theater. The author mentions that this is a family habit, they've done it at other places like malls and stadiums, but a friend called them out. They now feel conflicted because they think there are cleaners and it's not a big deal, but they also don't want to be seen as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. Generally, in public places, people are expected to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind can be considered inconsiderate because it creates extra work for staff and might be unsanitary for others. Movie theaters, in particular, can get messy, and expecting staff to clean up after everyone isn't ideal. But the author argues that theaters have staff for that, and maybe the scale is small. \n\nHowever, just because there are cleaners doesn't mean it's okay to leave trash. It's about courtesy and respect for the environment and others. If everyone left their trash, it would be overwhelming for staff. Also, the cost of going to the theater is a separate issue; even if it's expensive, it's still a public space where etiquette applies.\n\nThe author's friend called them out, which suggests that some people do see this as a problem. The author might not be malicious, but their action is still contributing to a negative experience for others. They might not be a \"monster,\" but they are inconsiderate in this case. The key is whether the action is wrong regardless of intent.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because not disposing of trash in public places is generally expected, and even if there are cleaners, it's a matter of responsibility and consideration for others.\n"
