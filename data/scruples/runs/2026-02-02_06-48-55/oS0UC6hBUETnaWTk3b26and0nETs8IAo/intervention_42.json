      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were raised in a culture where they didn't clean up after themselves in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend called them out on it, and now they're conflicted. They throw away the trash now but feel it's not a big deal because there are cleaners and movie theaters aren't packed anymore. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater as a reason to not feel guilty.\n\nHmm. On one hand, public places do expect people to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash around can create a mess and make the environment unpleasant for others. It's also a matter of respect for the cleaning staff, who have to deal with the mess if people don't take responsibility. Even if there are fewer people now, contributing to cleanliness is a social norm in many places. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that there are cleaners and it's expensive to go to the theater. However, just because someone else cleans up doesn't mean it's acceptable to litter. The cost of the outing isn't a valid excuse for not following basic social etiquette. Everyone should contribute to keeping public spaces clean, regardless of the cost of entry.\n\nThe author's friend pointing this out shows that their behavior is considered inconsiderate by others. While the author might have grown up with different norms, adapting to more universally accepted practices is important in maintaining social harmony. \n\nSo, the act of not cleaning up is a breach of social etiquette, even if the consequences aren't severe. The author is in the wrong because they didn't take responsibility for their trash, which is a basic courtesy expected in public spaces. Their justifications don't negate the inconsiderate nature of their action.\n"
