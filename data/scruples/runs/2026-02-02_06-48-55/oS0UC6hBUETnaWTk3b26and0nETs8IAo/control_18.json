But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains that their family didn't do that, they've done it before at other places like food courts and stadiums, and a friend scolded them. They argue that theaters have cleaning staff and it's expensive to go to the movies, but they want to know if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, especially in the U.S., it's common to dispose of your own trash in public places like movie theaters. Leaving it around can be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reasoning about cleaning staff might be valid, but it's still a courtesy to dispose of trash properly. \n\nThe fact that movie theaters seat 30 people now might mean smaller spaces, so leaving trash could be more disruptive. Also, the expense of going to the theater doesn't justify littering. The friend's reaction suggests that the social expectation wasn't met. \n\nHowever, the author's family culture is a factor. If they grew up in a place where this was normal, it's a cultural difference. But in many societies, cleaning up after oneself is a basic social norm. So while the author might not be malicious, they are not following the expected behavior, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe key here is balancing personal habits with social expectations. Even if the cleaning staff exists, the effort to throw trash in the bin is minimal and shows respect for the environment and others. The author's argument about cost is a red herring; it doesn't excuse leaving trash. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. They should have disposed of their trash, even if it's not a huge burden. The friend's correction was valid, and the author's justification doesn't outweigh the social expectation.\n"
