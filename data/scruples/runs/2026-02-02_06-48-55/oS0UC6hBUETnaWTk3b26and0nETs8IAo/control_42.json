But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains that this is their family's culture, but a friend scolded them. The author now feels conflicted because they think there are cleaners and the theaters aren't too crowded, making it not a big task. Also, they mention the cost of going to the movies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. Generally, in public places like theaters, it's expected to clean up after oneself. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. It's about being respectful to the environment and the next people using the space. The author's friend is probably right in pointing this out, as it's a common courtesy.\n\nThe author's reasoning about the cleaners and the number of people in the theater might be valid in terms of logistics, but that doesn't negate the social expectation. People might perceive not cleaning up as being lazy or not considerate. The argument about the cost of going to the theater could be a stretch\u2014paying for the ticket doesn't mean you can skip basic etiquette.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't causing immediate harm by leaving trash, especially if it's picked up. But social norms are about mutual respect. Even if the task isn't onerous for cleaners, the act of cleaning up is a small gesture that shows consideration. The author is aware of this and is questioning their actions, which is a good sign, but the key point is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nIn many cultures, leaving trash in public spaces is frowned upon. Theaters often have signs asking patrons to dispose of waste properly. So, even if the author grew up with different habits, they're now in a public setting where the expectation is different. The friend's reaction is a valid one, as it's about maintaining a clean environment for everyone.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they're not adhering to the social norm of cleaning up after themselves in a public place, despite their reasoning. It's about respecting the shared space and the effort others put into keeping it clean.\n"
