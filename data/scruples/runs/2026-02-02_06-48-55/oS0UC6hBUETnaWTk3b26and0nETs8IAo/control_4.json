Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash after a movie. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's family culture made it normal to leave trash in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. They were called out by a friend for doing this at a movie theater. The author argues that there are cleaners, theaters aren't that full anymore (only 30 people?), and movie tickets are expensive. They're conflicted between not wanting to be seen as an asshole and their upbringing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a social etiquette perspective, most people consider it polite to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Even if there are staff cleaning, contributing to less work for them can be seen as considerate. The author's reasoning about the theater's capacity might not matter\u2014if everyone leaves trash, it adds up. Also, the cost of the ticket isn't directly related to cleaning responsibility. \n\nBut there's also the cultural upbringing angle. If the family normalized this behavior, the author might not have known any different. However, societal norms generally expect individuals to dispose of their trash properly. The friend's reaction suggests that others do care about this. The author is trying to adjust but is confused because they see cleaners as part of the theater's operation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't a \"bad person\" for this one action, but they are in the wrong in terms of social expectations. The key here is whether the action is objectively wrong regardless of upbringing. I think society does expect people to clean up after themselves, so the author is wrong in that sense. However, there's leniency for cultural differences. But the friend's criticism is valid, and the author should probably start disposing of trash to align with broader social norms. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
