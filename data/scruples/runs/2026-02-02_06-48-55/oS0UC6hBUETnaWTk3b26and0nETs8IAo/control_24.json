      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author mentions that this is a family norm; they've done it at malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend criticized them, but they feel it's not a big deal because theaters have cleaners and the seating isn't that full. Also, they mention the high cost of theaters as a reason they might not want to spend the time cleaning up.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms. There's a general expectation to clean up after oneself in public places, especially in places where others will be using the same space. Movie theaters are typically expected to be left clean for the next audience. However, the argument the author makes is that there are people who clean up, so maybe it's not a huge issue. But the presence of cleaners doesn't negate the social expectation; people usually still clean up to maintain a tidy environment and reduce the workload for staff.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. If only one person doesn't clean up, it's manageable, but if many do the same, it adds up. The author's justification about the cost of going to the theater might be a red herring. The cost to the individual is low (a few seconds to throw away trash), whereas the collective impact could be more significant. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that there's a social norm in their circle where cleaning up is expected. The author's actions might cause inconvenience or annoyance to others, even if it's not a major task. Being considerate of others' experiences is part of being polite in public spaces.\n\nHowever, there's no legal obligation here. It's more about social etiquette. The author isn't breaking any rules, but they might be violating social expectations. The question is whether violating that expectation makes them wrong. \n\nIn some cases, people argue that if someone is paid to clean, then it's their job. But that's a bit of a contentious viewpoint because it's about shared responsibility. Public spaces benefit from everyone contributing a little to maintain cleanliness.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but they aren't necessarily \"wrong\" in a strict sense. However, the friend's reaction is valid because it's about respecting the environment and others' experiences. The answer might depend on cultural norms and individual perspectives.\n\nBut the user is asking for a binary answer: A for yes (wrong) or B for no (not wrong). Considering the arguments, the author isn't doing something illegal or harmful, but they are not meeting a common social expectation. So, are they in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn some cultures, cleaning up is expected, so in that case, the answer would be A. In others, if it's a minor issue, maybe B. Given that the friend was offended and the author is questioning their behavior, it's likely that the social norm in their context does consider it wrong. So, answer A.\n"
