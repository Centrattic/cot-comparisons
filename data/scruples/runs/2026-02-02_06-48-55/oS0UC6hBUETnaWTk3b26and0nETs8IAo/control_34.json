But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn after a movie. The person is used to not doing that in certain places like malls or stadiums, but their friend scolded them at the movie theater. The author defends their behavior by saying there are people to clean up, the theaters aren't that crowded, and movie tickets are expensive. They're asking if they're an a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Generally, in shared spaces like movie theaters, it's expected to clean up after oneself to maintain cleanliness and respect for others. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate because it adds to the cleaners' workload and may affect other patrons' experience. However, the author points out that theaters have staff for this, so maybe it's not a huge issue.\n\nBut the friend's reaction suggests that the social norm in their circle is to clean up. The author's argument about the number of people might not hold if there are many people doing the same. Even if each person leaves a little, it adds up. The cost of tickets isn't directly related to the responsibility to clean up.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't causing direct harm, just not contributing to cleanup. It's more about social expectations versus personal habits. The key here is whether the action is wrong in terms of social etiquette. Since many places have policies about cleaning up, and others might find it rude, the author might be in the wrong. But others might think it's a minor issue since there's cleaning staff.\n\nI should weigh the social norms versus the practicality. In many cultures, leaving your trash is frowned upon regardless of who cleans up. So the answer might lean towards yes. But the author is trying not to be an a**hole, so maybe they're not entirely wrong. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A because not cleaning up is generally considered rude, even if there's staff. But I'm not 100% sure. Some might argue that the theater's staff is there for that purpose, so the author isn't at fault. But social norms usually expect people to clean up in public places. So I think the answer is A, yes.\n"
