But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. In most public places, it's common courtesy to clean up after yourself. Leaving trash behind, even in a place that's cleaned regularly, can be seen as inconsiderate. The author mentions they grew up in a family where this was the norm, but that doesn't necessarily justify it. Personal habits or family culture don't override general social etiquette.\n\nThe author argues that there are cleaners to handle the trash and that movie theaters are expensive. However, relying on others to clean up after you is generally frowned upon. It's about respect for the space and the people who maintain it. Even if each individual act seems small, the cumulative effect of many people not cleaning up can lead to more work for staff and a less pleasant environment for everyone.\n\nThe friend's reaction indicates that this behavior is outside of the friend's expectations. While the author isn't causing direct harm, the social expectation is to dispose of one's trash properly. The cost of going to the theater doesn't mitigate the responsibility to be considerate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't causing immediate harm, and the movie theater's cleaning schedule might handle the waste. But the key point is about social responsibility and consideration for others. The author's reasoning that it's not a big task because of the cleaning staff overlooks the fact that it's still a courtesy to dispose of trash in designated bins, reducing the workload and maintaining cleanliness for others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't acting maliciously, the act of not disposing of trash in a public space where it's expected is indeed a minor social transgression. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
