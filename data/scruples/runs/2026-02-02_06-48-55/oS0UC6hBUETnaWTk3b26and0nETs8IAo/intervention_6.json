      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that they were raised in a culture where they didn't clean up after themselves in places like the mall food court, football stadiums, and movie theaters. However, their friend scolded them after a movie, and they now feel conflicted because they argue that there are cleaners who handle the theaters, and movie tickets are expensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's considered polite to clean up after oneself in public spaces. Leaving trash around can be seen as inconsiderate, especially in enclosed spaces like a movie theater where people are seated close together. The presence of cleaning staff doesn't necessarily absolve individuals from responsibility because it's a shared space. If everyone left their trash, the environment would be worse, and the staff would have more work than necessary.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's not a big task since theaters seat 30 people now. But even a small number, if multiple people do the same, it adds up. Also, the cost of movie tickets doesn't justify being inconsiderate. The friend's reaction might be based on personal expectations or societal standards that value maintaining clean public spaces regardless of the cost.\n\nAnother angle is cultural differences. The author mentions their family's culture, but that doesn't mean their behavior is socially acceptable elsewhere. Being inconsiderate can be seen as rude regardless of upbringing. The author also says they don't want to be an asshole, so they're aware there might be an issue.\n\nHowever, the argument that there are people to clean up might mitigate some blame. But I think the general expectation is that people should dispose of their own trash, especially in a paid environment where cleanliness is part of the experience. So, even if someone else is responsible for cleaning, it's still courteous to clean up after oneself.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be in the wrong legally or in terms of strict policy (unless the theater explicitly requires it), socially and morally, they might be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's reaction is valid because it's about respecting shared spaces. So the answer leans towards A.\n"
