But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not disposing of their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's friend criticized them for it, and now they're seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Movie theaters typically have a culture where patrons are expected to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate because it's a shared space. Even though the author mentions that there are cleaners, it's still considered polite to do your part. Plus, modern theaters might have smaller capacities, but the expectation of personal responsibility remains.\n\nThe author argues that movie tickets are expensive, so maybe they feel it's the theater's responsibility to handle the cleanup. However, that's not a common viewpoint. Most people would agree that while the theater does have staff, individuals should contribute to keeping the space clean for everyone's comfort.\n\nThe author's friend is upset because they value tidiness in public places. The author might be coming from a different upbringing where this wasn't emphasized, but social expectations often take precedence over personal habits. Even if the theater isn't overwhelmed, it's a matter of respect for others and maintaining a pleasant environment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of being considerate. If someone else has to clean up after you, it adds to their workload. It's a small act that shows consideration. The author might not be an \"asshole,\" but they are being inconsiderate in this specific instance.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. Some might argue that as long as there are staff to clean up, it's not a huge issue. But generally, public etiquette suggests that people should dispose of their trash properly. The author's explanation about not feeling wrong because there are cleaners is a common defense, but it's not accepted as a valid excuse in most social contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be an asshole, their action is inconsiderate and against typical social norms. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
