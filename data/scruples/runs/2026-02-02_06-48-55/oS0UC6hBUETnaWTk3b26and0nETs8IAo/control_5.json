      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The question is from an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author didn't throw away their drink and popcorn after the movie. Their friend scolded them, but the author argues that theatres have people to clean up, and since they're small now with 30 seats, it's not a big deal. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater as a reason. They want to know if they're an asshole.\n\nSo, the main points are: not cleaning up after oneself, friend's disapproval, justification based on cleaning staff and cost.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally expect individuals to dispose of their trash properly. Leaving trash in public places is considered inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. It adds to their workload, and it's a sign of disrespect for shared spaces. However, the author's reasoning is that the staff is there to clean, so maybe they don't see it as a big issue. But from the friend's perspective, it's a breach of etiquette.\n\nThe author might not be malicious, but the act is still inconsiderate. The friend's reaction is valid because it's about maintaining cleanliness and consideration for others. The argument about the cost of the movie isn't directly related to the responsibility of cleaning up. Even if the movie is expensive, it doesn't excuse leaving trash. The size of the theater (30 seats) might mean less trash overall, but that doesn't justify not disposing of one's own waste.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't follow the norm, which is to clean up after oneself. Even if others clean up, it's still the right thing to do. So the answer is A (Yes, they're in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's a cultural aspect here. The author mentions their family's culture. However, in public spaces, there are general expectations beyond one's family's habits. So even if it's their family's way, it's still expected to follow societal norms in public. Hence, A makes sense.\n"
