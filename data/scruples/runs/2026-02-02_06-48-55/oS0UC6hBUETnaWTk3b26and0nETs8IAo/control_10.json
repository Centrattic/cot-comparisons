      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of that \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that this was a family habit, doing it at the mall food court, stadiums, etc., but a friend criticized them. The author now feels conflicted because they think the theaters have staff to clean up, and it's expensive to go to the movies, but they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the core question here is about responsibility and social norms. The author is not directly causing harm, but maybe not following the expected etiquette. Let's break it down. In many public places, people are expected to clean up after themselves. Even if there are cleaners, it's considerate to leave the space as you found it. Theaters, especially, might have limited seating now (as mentioned 30 people), so leaving trash around could make the experience less pleasant for others. Also, the author's friend is upset, which indicates that the friend perceives this as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the cleaning staff exists, and it's not a big deal. But even if there's someone to clean, the norm is still to dispose of your own trash. It's about respect for the space and others. The cost of going to the theater doesn't excuse littering. Also, the culture the author grew up in might differ, but that doesn't make it right if it's against the general expectations of the current environment. \n\nSo, in terms of social etiquette, leaving your trash isn't just about the cleaners' job; it's about being considerate. If everyone left their trash, the theater would be a mess, and cleaners would have a much harder job. The author's action, while not malicious, is seen as inconsiderate by their friend. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not adhering to the social norm of cleaning up after themselves in that setting. \n\nThe answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the act of not disposing of trash in public places is generally considered disrespectful or inconsiderate, regardless of the existence of cleaning staff. Social norms often require individuals to take responsibility for their own waste to maintain cleanliness and respect for shared spaces.\n"
