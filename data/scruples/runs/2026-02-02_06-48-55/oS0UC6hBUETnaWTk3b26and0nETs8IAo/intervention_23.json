But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The author's reasoning includes that their family's culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, they've done it in other places like malls and stadiums, their friend called them out, but they argue that theaters have cleaners, it's expensive to go to movies now, and they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether it's acceptable to leave trash in a public place like a movie theater. In most societies, there's an unspoken rule to clean up after oneself in public spaces. Theaters, especially, can get crowded, and even if there are cleaners, leaving trash can be seen as inconsiderate. The author might think it's someone else's job, but that's a common argument for littering. However, theaters do have a system where staff clean up, but it's still considered good manners to dispose of your own trash. \n\nThe author's point about the cost of going to the theater is a bit of a stretch. While it's true that theaters are expensive, that doesn't justify not cleaning up. The friend's reaction suggests that the social norm in the friend's perspective is that you should take out your trash. The author's family culture is different, but social norms can vary, and in this case, the friend's perspective seems to align with the general expectation. \n\nTheaters do seat 30 people now post-pandemic, but even with smaller numbers, leaving trash can affect the experience for others. It's a matter of consideration for others and maintaining cleanliness. The author's reasoning that it's not a big task for cleaners might be true, but it's not the cleaners' job to handle individual's trash; people are expected to dispose of it in the provided bins. \n\nSo, the author is probably in the wrong because they're not following a common social norm of cleaning up after themselves in public places. While their reasoning has some points, the expectation in most places is that you take your trash with you. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
