But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author grew up in a family where they didn't dispose of trash in public places like malls or stadiums, but after a friend criticized them, they threw it away. However, they're questioning if they're an a**hole because theaters have cleaners and it's expensive to go there.\n\nFirst, I should consider social norms. Most public places expect you to clean up after yourself. Leaving trash behind is generally considered rude and inconsiderate. Even if there are cleaners, it's a matter of basic courtesy to dispose of your own waste. Theaters are shared spaces, and leaving trash can affect other people's experience.\n\nThe author mentions that theaters seat 30 people now, implying smaller spaces. So, even if it's a small number, the act of not cleaning up could make the area less pleasant for others. The cost of going to the theater doesn't negate the responsibility to be considerate. The friend's feedback was probably pointing out this social expectation.\n\nThe author's reasoning about cleaners and expense doesn't justify leaving trash. It's about respect for others' environment. The fact that they threw it away after being told shows they care, but the initial action was still incorrect. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
