Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

The person's reasoning is that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up in public places, and they mention that theaters have cleaning staff. They also argue that theaters are expensive and that it's not a big task for cleaners.\n\nHmm, so I need to decide if AITA here. The person's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because, even though there are cleaners, it's a shared space. Leaving trash behind could make the seats uncomfortable for the next person or contribute to more work for staff. But the person isn't doing it out of malice; it's a cultural upbringing. However, societal norms generally expect people to clean up after themselves in public places. Even if there are cleaners, it's a matter of respect and consideration. The argument about cost and capacity might not be strong enough because it's about personal responsibility. So I think the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
