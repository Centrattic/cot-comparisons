But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. The author mentions that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, and they left trash in places like malls and stadiums. A friend scolded them, so now they're conflicted. They argue that theaters have 30 seats, so it's not a big deal for the cleaners, and since movie tickets are expensive, maybe it's expected the theater handles it. But they're worried about being an asshole.\n\nHmm. Well, the main issue here is whether leaving trash in the theater is acceptable. Even if the theater has staff to clean, it's still a public space. Leaving your garbage behind adds extra work for employees who are already dealing with a lot of customers. Plus, it's considerate to leave the space as clean as you found it. The author's reasoning that it's not a big task because of the number of seats might be a stretch. Every bit adds up, and expecting others to clean up after you can be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's not \"wrong\" in a legal sense.\n\nThe author's friend called them out, which is a social cue. They're trying to be considerate now, but the initial action was probably rude. The justification about the cost of the ticket doesn't really mitigate the responsibility to clean up. So, even if the author isn't breaking any rules, their behavior is socially inappropriate. So I think the answer is A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
