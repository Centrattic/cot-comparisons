      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions their family's habits, that people clean the theaters, and the high cost of going to the movies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, people are expected to clean up after themselves in public places to maintain cleanliness and respect for others. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaning staff. The argument that theaters have cleaners might not absolve the person, because it's still about personal responsibility and consideration for the environment and other patrons.\n\nThen there's the cost argument. The person says it's expensive to go to movies, but that doesn't directly relate to the responsibility of cleaning up. It's a separate issue. Also, the cost doesn't excuse not contributing to a clean environment. \n\nThe author's friend called them out, which shows that some people do find this behavior unacceptable. However, the author doesn't feel entirely wrong, which suggests there's a cultural or personal background influencing their view. \n\nBut from a general perspective, public hygiene is usually considered everyone's responsibility. Even if the theater is cleaned later, leaving trash around can affect the experience of others. It's a small action but part of being a considerate member of a community. \n\nSo, while the author's reasoning has some points, the act of not disposing of trash properly is generally seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
