      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author mentions that they grew up with a certain culture where they didn't clean up, like at malls and stadiums. Now, a friend is upset about it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about responsibility and social norms. The author argues that there are cleaners, the theaters are small now, and going to the movies is expensive. But the friend is upset. \n\nFirst, I should consider the common etiquette. Usually, when you're in a public place, especially a seated area like a movie theater, people are expected to clean up after themselves to keep the space tidy for others. Leaving trash around can be inconvenient for the next audience and for the cleaning staff. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that there are people to clean up, but that doesn't mean it's acceptable to litter. Even if someone else is responsible for cleaning, it's a matter of respect and consideration. If everyone left their trash, it would be overwhelming for the staff and create a mess for others to sit in. \n\nAlso, the size of the theater being 30 seats doesn't negate the responsibility. It's a matter of principle. The cost of the tickets shouldn't affect this; paying for a ticket doesn't give the right to be inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's friend is upset, which shows that there's a social expectation here. Even if the author's family didn't teach that, societal norms now might expect cleaning up. The author might not be a bad person, but they are being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because leaving trash behind is disrespectful and burdens others. The answer should be A.\n"
