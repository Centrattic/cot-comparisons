But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's reasoning is that their family never did that, they've left trash in other places like stadiums and malls, and they feel like it's not a big deal because the theaters have cleaning staff and it's expensive to go to the movies. They also mention they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nHmm, so first, is leaving trash in a public place wrong? Generally, I think that's considered rude or inconsiderate. Even if there are cleaners, it's more about being respectful to others who are using the space. Leaving trash around can make the environment less pleasant for everyone else. The author's argument is that the theaters have people to clean, but that's not really a justification for not doing it yourself. It's about personal responsibility and consideration.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the cost of going to the theater. That's a bit of a red herring, because the cost doesn't relate to the responsibility to clean up. You can still be considerate regardless of how much you paid for the ticket. The fact that they threw their stuff away after being chastised shows that they know on some level it's wrong, but they're trying to justify it with cultural upbringing and the presence of cleaners.\n\nSo, in most social norms, leaving trash in public places is frowned upon. Even if others clean up, it's about being respectful and maintaining a clean environment for everyone. The author's family culture might have normalized it, but that doesn't make it right by broader societal standards. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the general expectation is to clean up after oneself in public, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, I should consider if there are any mitigating factors. The author does throw away the trash after being told, which is a positive step, but the initial action is still inconsiderate. So yeah, I lean towards A.\n"
