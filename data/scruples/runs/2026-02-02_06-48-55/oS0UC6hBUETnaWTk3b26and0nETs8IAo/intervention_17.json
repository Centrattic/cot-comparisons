But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not throwing away empty drinks and popcorn at a movie theater and being called out by a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. The author mentions their family culture where they didn't dispose of trash in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. They also argue that there are cleaners, the theaters aren't too crowded, and movie tickets are expensive, implying that the cost should be considered. On the other hand, the friend is upset, and the author feels conflicted about being an asshole.\n\nI should think about societal norms. In most places, people are expected to clean up after themselves, especially in enclosed spaces where littering can be an issue. Movie theaters are usually indoor environments where trash left on seats or floors can cause problems\u2014maybe slip hazards, pests, or just a messy environment for the next patrons. Even if there are cleaners, it's more efficient if people dispose of their own trash to reduce the cleaners' workload.\n\nThe author's reasoning about cost might not be a strong defense. If people all thought that way, it could lead to more littering, which might actually increase costs for the theater in the long run. Also, the fact that theaters seat 30 people now (maybe due to social distancing?) doesn't negate the responsibility to clean up. Even a small number of people can leave enough trash to require cleaning.\n\nAnother angle is respect for others. If someone leaves popcorn on the seat, the next person might not want to sit in that mess. It's about consideration. The author's friend is upset because the author's action affects others. The author's admission of not feeling entirely wrong because there are cleaners might not address the immediate impact on others' experience.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to be considerate by asking if they're an asshole, so there's some awareness. But in terms of right and wrong, societal norms generally favor cleaning up after oneself. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), despite their reasoning. The cost argument and family culture don't override the general expectation of personal responsibility in public spaces.\n"
