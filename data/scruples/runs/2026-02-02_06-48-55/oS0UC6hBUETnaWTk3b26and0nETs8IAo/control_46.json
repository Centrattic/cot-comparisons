But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. Their reasoning is that their family never did this, they've done it in other places like malls and stadiums, and they feel it's not a big deal since there are people who clean up anyway. They also mention the high cost of going to the theater and not wanting to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. In most public places, people are expected to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind can be seen as disrespectful to the venue and the staff. Even if there are cleaners, it's a matter of responsibility. The person might not be aware that this is considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that their behavior was noticed and found unacceptable. While the argument about cost is valid, it doesn't negate the etiquette of being considerate. The size of the theater (30 seats) might mean less space, so leaving trash could cause more inconvenience compared to larger venues.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect mentioned. If their family didn't emphasize cleaning up, maybe they weren't taught this practice. But societal norms generally expect this behavior regardless of personal upbringing. The cleaners' job is to maintain the venue, but it's still polite to dispose of trash properly.\n\nSo, even though there's no explicit rule against it, the social expectation is to clean up. The person's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, hence AITA (Am I the Asshole) in this context. The answer would lean towards yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
