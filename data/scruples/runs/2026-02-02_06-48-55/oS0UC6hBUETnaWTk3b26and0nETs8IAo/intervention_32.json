      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn after a movie. The author mentions they were raised in a culture where they left trash at places like malls, football stadiums, and movie theaters. Their friend criticized them for it after a movie, so they threw their stuff away this time. But they're confused because they feel there are people who clean the theaters, and with the current seating capacity (30 people now?), it's not a big task. Plus, they mention the high cost of going to the theater, implying maybe they feel it's less important to clean up if they're paying a lot.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They were raised that way, there are cleaners, theaters aren't too crowded now, and they don't want to be an asshole. But is it acceptable to leave trash in public spaces? Even if others clean up, it's generally considered polite to dispose of your own trash. Leaving it around can be seen as inconsiderate, contributing to litter, and not respecting the space. The fact that there are cleaners doesn't negate personal responsibility. Even in places where staff clean up, people are expected to put their trash in bins, not leave it lying around.\n\nThe author's friend pointing it out suggests that in their friend's culture or personal opinion, this is wrong. The author is trying to adjust but is conflicted. The argument about the number of people in the theater is weak. If the theater seats 30 now, maybe it's less, but if everyone left their trash, it would add up. The high cost doesn't justify not cleaning up\u2014people pay for experiences, but that doesn't mean they can leave messes. \n\nSo, societal norms generally lean towards cleaning up after oneself in public places. Even if others do the cleaning, it's a sign of respect and consideration. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
