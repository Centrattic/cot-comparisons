But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains that this is their family's culture, and they've done it in other places like malls and stadiums. Their friend criticized them after the movie, but the author defends their actions by saying there are cleaners, the theaters aren't too crowded, and the cost of going to the theater is high. They also don't want to be seen as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. In most places, it's expected to clean up after yourself to maintain a clean environment for others. Leaving trash in public areas is generally considered inconsiderate, even if there are staff to clean up later. The presence of cleaners doesn't absolve individuals from responsibility because it adds to the workload of those staff members. The argument about theaters seating 30 people now might be a stretch, as 30 people per theater is actually a smaller capacity, which could mean each person's trash is more noticeable or has a bigger impact relative to the space. \n\nThe cost of going to the theater being high doesn't excuse not cleaning up. People pay for the experience, which includes a clean environment. The author's friend pointing it out suggests that there's a social expectation to dispose of trash properly. The author's own admission that they don't want to be an asshole indicates they're aware that their actions might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nCultural norms can vary, but in most modern public contexts, especially in the Western world, cleaning up after yourself is a standard social expectation. The author's family culture might be different, but when in a public space that's shared with others, following the general societal norm is usually expected. The fact that they changed their behavior after being told implies they recognize there's an issue, even if they're conflicted about it. \n\nSo, while the author might not be a complete asshole, their actions do go against common social expectations of cleanliness and consideration for others. Therefore, they are in the wrong for not disposing of their trash in the movie theater.\n"
