Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author explains that their family didn't do that, and they've done it at places like malls and stadiums. Their friend criticized them, so they did throw it away after the movie. They argue that there are cleaners, the theaters aren't too crowded now, and going to the movies is expensive. But they don't want to be an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's becoming more common to clean up after oneself in public places. Movie theaters often have strict policies about littering because it's a shared space. Even if there are cleaning staff, leaving trash can be inconvenient and unhygienic for others. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes the idea that it's not a big task for 30 people. But even a small amount of trash can add up and affect the experience for other patrons. Also, the cost of the tickets doesn't justify not cleaning up. People might argue that they paid to enjoy the movie, not to deal with someone else's trash.\n\nHowever, the author did correct their behavior after being told, which shows they're receptive to feedback. That might mitigate being in the wrong. But the initial action\u2014leaving trash\u2014still goes against common etiquette. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a point against the author. If a close friend points it out, it's a sign that their behavior is noticeable and possibly offensive. The author's family culture is mentioned, but social norms have shifted in many areas, so family habits might not align with current expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author isn't a bad person for not doing something they weren't raised to do. However, being considerate in public spaces is generally expected. The act of not cleaning up is seen as inconsiderate, even if others are cleaning. \n\nSo, balancing these points, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
