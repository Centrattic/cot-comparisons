Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The friend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around public spaces. Typically, people are expected to clean up after themselves in shared areas. Movie theaters are a bit of a mixed bag because they do have cleaning staff, but maybe the expectation is still there for patrons to do their part. \n\nThe author mentions their family culture didn't emphasize this, so they might not have been taught to do it. But that's not an excuse if the general societal norm is different. Also, they mention that theaters now seat 30 people, implying smaller venues. Maybe the logistics of cleaning are different, but even a small number of people can leave a mess if everyone doesn't dispose of their trash properly.\n\nThe cost of going to the theater is high, but that's separate from the responsibility to clean up. Paying for a ticket doesn't mean you get to ignore the rules. The person could argue that they're not causing harm, but leaving trash behind could create an unpleasant environment for others and add to the workload of staff. Even if there are cleaners, it's more considerate to dispose of your own waste.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to be considerate by asking if they're an asshole, which shows they care. But the act itself is generally seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might lean towards A. But maybe not everyone agrees. Some might say if there's a cleaning crew, it's not a big deal. But generally, the socially accepted norm is to clean up after oneself in public spaces unless it's impractical. In a movie theater, it's not impractical; you can just take the trash with you or dispose of it properly. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a sign that others do mind. So the author is probably in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
