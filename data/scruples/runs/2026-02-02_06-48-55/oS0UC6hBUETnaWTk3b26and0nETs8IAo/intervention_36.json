Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not throwing away their trash at the movie theater. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nThe author mentions that they grew up in a family culture where they didn't always throw away trash in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. After a movie, a friend criticized them for not disposing of their drink and popcorn. The author threw the trash away after the movie but isn't sure if they were wrong. They argue that theaters have staff to clean, and with limited seating (30 people), it's not a big task. Also, they mention the high cost of theater visits as a reason to not feel guilty.\n\nNow, considering social norms, most public places expect patrons to clean up after themselves. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are cleaners. The friend's reaction suggests that the norm in the friend's view is to dispose of trash properly. The author's justification about cleaners and cost doesn't negate the social expectation. It's polite to contribute to a clean environment for others. While the author isn't a complete jerk, the act of leaving trash is a small but noticeable breach of etiquette. So, the answer is A.\n"
