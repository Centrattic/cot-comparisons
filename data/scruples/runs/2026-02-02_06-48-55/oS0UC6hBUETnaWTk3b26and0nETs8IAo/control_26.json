      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down what's happening here.\n\nFirst, the author didn't throw away their empty drink and popcorn after a movie. Their friend criticized them for it. The author's reasoning is that their family grew up with this as the norm\u2014leaving stuff at places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. They mention that theaters now have fewer seats (like 30 people) and it's not a big task for cleaners, plus movie tickets are expensive. They're conflicted because they don't want to be an asshole but are unsure if they're wrong.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, leaving trash behind is generally considered rude and irresponsible. Most places expect patrons to clean up after themselves. Theaters, in particular, may have policies about this to maintain cleanliness and ensure a good experience for others. The friend's reaction is a social cue that the author might have violated an unspoken rule here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that there are cleaners, so maybe it's not a huge issue. They might feel justified if others are responsible for cleaning. However, relying on others to clean up after you can be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the theater has staff, it's still a matter of personal responsibility and respect for shared spaces. Also, the fact that the friend called them out suggests that this behavior isn't universally accepted and there's a social expectation to dispose of trash properly.\n\nThe cost of movie tickets isn't a direct factor in the rightness of the action, but the author might feel that paying a high price entitles them to some leniency, which isn't a valid argument. The main issue is about social norms and consideration for others. Even in a small theater, leaving trash behind could create an unpleasant environment for the next viewers or the cleaning staff.\n\nSo, while the author's intent wasn't malicious, the action of leaving trash does contribute to a less respectful environment. The friend pointing it out is a valid reaction because it's about maintaining shared standards of behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, but maybe not an \"asshole\" in the strongest sense. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer would lean towards yes because they didn't follow the expected social norm here.\n"
