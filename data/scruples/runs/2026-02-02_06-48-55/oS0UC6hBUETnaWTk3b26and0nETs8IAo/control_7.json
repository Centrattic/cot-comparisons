But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether they should have thrown away their trash after the movie. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they grew up with a family culture where they didn't dispose of their trash in public places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. Their friend called them out for not throwing away their popcorn and drink, but the author argues that theater cleaners exist and that the theaters aren't too crowded, making it a small task. They also mention the high cost of movie tickets and don't want to be an asshole.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. In many places, it's considered polite to clean up after yourself in public to maintain cleanliness. Leaving trash around might be seen as inconsiderate, even if there are people who clean up. The author's reasoning about the cleaners is a bit off because even if there are staff, it's about being respectful and reducing their workload. Also, theaters have limited space, so leaving trash can be a safety or hygiene issue.\n\nThe author's friend's reaction is a clue that there's a social expectation they violated. Even if the author's family didn't teach them this way, societal norms might differ. The cost of the movie isn't a valid excuse for not cleaning up. The question is about whether the author is wrong, and from a general perspective, leaving trash in a theater is usually frowned upon. So, the answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
