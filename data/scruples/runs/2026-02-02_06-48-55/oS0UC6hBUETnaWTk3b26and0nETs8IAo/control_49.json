But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn after a movie. The author mentions their family's culture of not cleaning up in places like malls, stadiums, and theaters. They were reprimanded by a friend and now feel conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In most public places, especially theaters, it's customary to clean up after oneself. Leaving trash behind can be seen as inconsiderate to others and the staff. The argument here is that there are cleaners, but that doesn't mean it's acceptable to leave a mess. Theaters have limited seating, but even in smaller numbers, leaving trash is considered rude.\n\nThe author also mentions the high cost of movies. While that's a valid point about the expense, it doesn't excuse not cleaning up. The cost doesn't directly relate to the responsibility of maintaining cleanliness. The other person's reaction from the friend indicates that the behavior is socially frowned upon in that context.\n\nThe author is trying to balance their family's habits with social expectations. However, family norms don't necessarily align with broader social etiquette. It's possible the family's approach is more lenient, but in public spaces, there's an expectation of personal responsibility. The key point is that even if someone else cleans up, it's still considerate to leave the space as you found it.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions are inconsiderate to others and against common social norms. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
