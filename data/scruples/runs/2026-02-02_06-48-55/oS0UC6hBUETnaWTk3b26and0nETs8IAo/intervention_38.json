But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they didn't throw away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater, and a friend called them out. The author's reasoning is that their family culture didn't emphasize cleaning up, they do it in places like the mall food court but not at stadiums or theaters. They argue that movie theaters have staff to clean, and since they're expensive to go to, maybe it's not their responsibility. But they're worried about being an asshole.\n\nHmm. On one hand, public etiquette usually expects people to clean up after themselves, especially in shared spaces. Leaving trash around can be a hassle for others and for the staff. The author's argument about the staff cleaning up is valid, but that doesn't mean they should leave it for others. Even if there's a cleaning crew, the theater's environment is better if everyone does their part. Plus, in a place where many people gather, like a theater, leaving trash can affect the experience for others. The author's friend was upset, so maybe their action was disrespectful. The cost of the movie isn't a strong argument for not cleaning up. It's about consideration for others and maintaining a clean space. The author might not be a total asshole, but they did do something that others might see as inconsiderate. So I think the answer is A.\n"
