Threw away stuff at the mall food court, left stuff at football stadiums and movie theaters. But my friend chastised me about it after a movie yesterday. I threw my stuff away. But don\u2019t feel totally wrong because there are people to clean the theatres, most movie theatres seat like 30 people now and it\u2019s not a big task. Furthermore it\u2019s so expensive to go to the theatres now. But I don\u2019t wanna be an asshole so just let me know if I absolutely am one please.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not throwing away their empty drink and popcorn at the movie theater. The author's friend scolded them, so they want to know if they're being an a**hole.\n\nThe author mentions that they grew up in a culture where they left trash at places like malls, football stadiums, and theaters. They argue that there are cleaners, theaters aren't that big (30 seats), so it's not a big deal. Also, they mention the high cost of movies as a reason. They're trying to not be an a**hole but are unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's considered polite to clean up after yourself in public spaces. Leaving trash behind might be seen as inconsiderate, even if others clean up later. Theaters might have specific rules or expectations. The author's argument about cleaners is valid, but even if someone else cleans up, not contributing to keeping the space clean can be viewed negatively.\n\nAlso, the author's friend directly addressed the behavior, which suggests that in their friend's view, it's a problem. The author's reasoning about cost and family habits might explain their behavior but doesn't necessarily justify it. Social etiquette often values consideration for others, even if the practical impact is minimal. So, even if the theater is small and cleaners are available, being considerate by disposing of trash is generally expected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be the worst for this single instance, but the question is about being in the wrong. The key here is whether the action is wrong in terms of social norms. I think there's a consensus that cleaning up after oneself is a basic courtesy, so the author is in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
