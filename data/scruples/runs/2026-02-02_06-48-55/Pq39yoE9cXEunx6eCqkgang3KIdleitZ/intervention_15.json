I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their story carefully.\n\nThe person is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling the morning rush alone because another cashier was sick. They didn't get a break and had to go to the bathroom. Their manager told them to take a 15-minute break. When they were walking through the store, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The writer says they were on break and walked away. Then the manager wrote them up for being rude. The writer argues that their past experiences made them cautious about engaging with customers, especially when they had to use the bathroom urgently.\n\nFirst, let's look at the rules. The writer was given a break by their manager, so technically, when the customer approached them during that break, they were not supposed to be working. Employees are usually supposed to step away from customer interactions when on a break. But the customer might not know that. So, the writer's response was to say they were on break and leave. The manager saw this as being rude, hence the write-up.\n\nThe writer's defense is that they had to use the bathroom and didn't want to get into a long conversation. They mention past experiences where simple questions became complicated. However, the manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and not being helpful is a problem.\n\nNow, considering workplace policies: when on a break, employees shouldn't be assisting customers. But if the customer approaches them, maybe the employee is expected to direct them to another staff member or help briefly. However, the writer was on a break, so they might not be in a position to help. But in retail, the expectation is that employees should be available to assist unless they're in a non-visible area.\n\nAnother point is that the writer was on probation. Probation periods usually mean that the employer is more strict about enforcing rules. The manager might have taken the write-up more seriously because of that. The writer's manager says they were a \"toenail away\" from a third write-up, which could lead to termination, indicating that this was a significant issue.\n\nThe writer's justification is that they had a valid reason (needing to use the bathroom), but the manager still took action. However, the writer was instructed to take the break, so they were following the manager's order. The problem is whether they should have helped the customer despite being on break.\n\nIn retail, employees are often advised to take breaks at the scheduled times, even if it means stepping away from the floor briefly. If the customer approached them while they were on a visible break (like walking through the store), the employee might be expected to say they're on break and assist if possible. But in this case, the writer didn't help, just said they were on break and left. Depending on company policy, this could be seen as rude if they didn't offer to help in any way.\n\nThe manager's reaction to the writer's explanation as arguing might also be a problem. The writer might have handled the situation better by politely explaining they were on break and offering to help after the break or directing the customer to another staff member if possible. Since the writer didn't do that, the manager's view is that they were rude.\n\nSo, considering all this, the writer might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the customer interaction appropriately during their break. Even though they had reasons (needing a bathroom break and past experiences), their response was to dismiss the customer, which could be seen as unprofessional according to company standards. The manager's strict enforcement due to probation adds to the issue.\n"
