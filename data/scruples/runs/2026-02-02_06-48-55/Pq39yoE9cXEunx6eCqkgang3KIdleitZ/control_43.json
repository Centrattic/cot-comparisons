I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a cashier at a grocery store who's on probation. They were working alone during a busy morning, didn't get a break, then when they finally took a break, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude and arguing when they explained their situation.\n\nFirst, the cashier had been handling the morning rush alone, didn't use the bathroom, and finally got permission from their manager to take a break. So their break time was supposed to be a chance to rest, including using the bathroom. The customer approached during the break, which might have been okay if the cashier had been on the floor. But the cashier was on break, which is a protected time. However, the manager told them to take a break, so maybe the cashier should have been in the break room or not on the floor? \n\nThe customer asked a question, and the cashier said they were on break. But maybe the cashier was still in a visible area where customers could approach. The problem is that the manager said the customer is always right, so even if the cashier was on break, they might still be expected to assist. But the cashier had a valid reason to be on break and needed to use the bathroom. \n\nThe manager wrote them up for being rude and arguing. The cashier wasn't arguing, they were explaining. The manager seems strict, maybe overreacting. The cashier's actions might be justified because they were on a break, but the manager's policy is strict. However, the manager might have known the cashier was under stress and still penalized them. \n\nIn some workplaces, being on break means you're not supposed to assist customers. But in others, especially if you're still in the store, you might be expected to help. The cashier's explanation about needing the bathroom adds context. But the manager's reaction could be seen as unfair. \n\nI think the cashier isn't entirely in the wrong because they followed the manager's instruction to take a break, but maybe they should have gone to the break room instead of being on the floor. However, the manager's response was harsh. So the answer might be B, the cashier isn't in the wrong.\n"
