I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation is that they were working a busy shift as a cashier, had to handle the morning rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, and when their manager finally told them to take a break, a customer approached them asking where something was. The cashier told the customer they were on break instead of answering the question, and the manager gave them a write-up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cashier was on a probationary period and had already been written up once, so another one could lead to termination. The manager told them to take a break, so technically, they were on break when the customer approached. However, the customer might not know that. The cashier was under stress, had been working without a break, and needed to use the bathroom.\n\nBut from the company's perspective, employees are expected to be helpful to customers even during breaks if they are on the premises. If the cashier was on break, maybe they should have moved to a different area or made it clear they were on break. However, the cashier was in the store and approached by a customer. The manager might have expected the cashier to still assist the customer even during a break, especially since it's a simple question. \n\nThe cashier's reasoning is that past experiences led them to avoid long conversations, but in this case, the question was straightforward. The cashier might have been in a hurry and chose to cut the interaction short, which could come across as rude. The manager's reaction is strict, but the company policy might prioritize customer service over employee breaks in such situations. \n\nSo, the cashier did follow the manager's instruction to take a break, but perhaps failed to handle the customer interaction appropriately. The manager's perspective is that the customer's needs take priority, and even during a break, the cashier should assist if possible. Therefore, the cashier might be at fault for not addressing the customer's request and being perceived as rude, even if they were on a break. \n\nBut considering the cashier's stress and need for a break, maybe the manager's approach is too harsh. However, the question is about whether the cashier is in the wrong. Since the customer approached them during a time when the cashier was supposed to be on break, but maybe breaks aren't meant for roaming the store and interacting with customers. So the cashier might have been in the wrong for not handling the situation better, like explaining they're on break but still helping.\n"
