I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the cashier was on break and told a customer she couldn't help because she was on break. The manager then wrote her up for being rude. The author is seeking to determine if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies of the workplace. If the employee was on a break, then she's not supposed to be working, right? But maybe being on break means she shouldn't be approached for work-related questions. However, cashiers often help customers on the floor, so maybe she was expected to assist even during a break? Wait, but if she was on a break, she's supposed to be off-duty. So if the customer approached her during her break, she wasn't in a position to help. But maybe the manager's policy is that employees are always expected to assist customers regardless of their break status? That could be a point of conflict.\n\nThen there's the context of her being on probation and the previous write-up. She mentions she's been there for about a month and is on probation. Being written up now could lead to termination. The manager's strict stance might be part of the company's policy to maintain standards, especially with probationary employees.\n\nThe customer's question was about Cadbury Cream eggs, which she found obvious. But the customer didn't look like they looked, so maybe she thought they were being difficult. However, the employee's response was to say she was on break and walk away. That could be seen as rude or dismissive, even if she was on a break. The manager's reaction is that she was being rude, and she was written up for that and for arguing when she explained.\n\nAnother angle is the employee's need to use the restroom. She had a long shift without a bathroom break. That's a legitimate concern, but if she was supposed to take breaks as scheduled, maybe she should have waited until her break to use the bathroom. But the manager had just told her to take a break, so she was on her break when the customer approached her. If the employee is on break, she's not supposed to be working, so she's not in a position to help. But maybe the manager expects employees to assist customers even during breaks if they're in the store. That's a possible point of misunderstanding between the employee and the manager.\n\nThe key points here are: Was the employee supposed to help customers during her break? If the company policy states that employees should be available to assist customers at all times, then she was in the wrong. If the break is a time when they can step away, then maybe not. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, so even if the employee was on a break, she should have helped. The employee's side is that she was on a break and had a valid reason to be away from the register.\n\nBut from a typical retail perspective, employees are usually expected to be on break in the break room and not on the sales floor. If she was on the floor during her break, maybe she should have been available to help. However, if she was in the break room, then she's not supposed to be working. The story says she was walking through the store on her break, which is common, but she might be expected to help if approached.\n\nThe manager's decision to write her up for being rude and then again for arguing adds another layer. The employee might be in the wrong for not following the manager's instructions, especially in a probationary period where the rules are more strict. The manager's \"customer is always right\" policy might take precedence over the employee's need to take a break, even if the customer's question was simple.\n\nIn summary, the employee might be in the wrong because she was supposed to assist the customer even during her break, leading to the write-up. However, her need to take a break after a long shift without bathroom access is understandable. The manager's strict policy and the probationary status add pressure. The answer might hinge on company policy and whether employees are allowed to disengage during breaks.\n"
