I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on break and told a customer that, instead of answering a question. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. If the employee was actually on break, then they might not be expected to help customers. But the manager told them to take the break, so maybe they were supposed to be off.\n\nBut the customer approached them on the floor. Even if it's not their shift, if an employee is in the store, sometimes customers might approach them. Depending on company policy, maybe employees are supposed to help regardless of break time. \n\nThe employee's reason was that they were on break and needed to use the bathroom. They were stressed about the probation and previous write-ups. However, the manager said the customer is always right. \n\nSo, the employee's action of turning away the customer might be seen as unprofessional. Even if they were on break, maybe they should have been more polite or offered to help later. The manager's reaction was strict, but the employee's explanation about needing to go to the bathroom might be valid. \n\nBut the key point is whether the employee was supposed to be on break. If the manager told them to take a break, then the employee isn't supposed to be working. If the customer approached them, maybe the employee is allowed to be on break. However, maybe the manager expects employees to assist customers even during breaks if they're in the store. \n\nAlso, the employee's past experiences where simple questions turned into long conversations might have influenced their decision. But they should handle it professionally. Instead of just walking away, maybe they could have said they were on break but could point the customer in the right direction. \n\nIn terms of company policy, if the manager's rule is that employees must be available even during breaks when in the store, then the employee was wrong. But if the break is a time when they're supposed to be off, then the manager's rule might be strict. However, the manager's response was to write them up for being rude, which might be harsh. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the employee might have been in the wrong if the company expects help even during breaks. But if the break is a time when they're allowed to not work, maybe not. The answer hinges on company policy and how the manager enforces it. Since the manager said the customer is always right, maybe the employee should have helped regardless of being on break. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
