I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a cashier on probation who was handling a busy morning shift alone. They were relieved by their manager and told to take a 15-minute break. While on the break, a customer approached and asked for Cadbury Cream eggs. The author told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude. The author is now questioning whether they were wrong.\n\nSo, key points to consider: probationary period, written up before, potential for another write-up leading to termination. The customer interaction happened while the author was supposedly on a break. The manager's instruction was for the author to take a break, but when the customer approached, the author was still in the store area and was interacting with a customer. \n\nIn many jobs, even during a break, employees are expected to be available and assist customers if needed unless told otherwise. The author might have been in a restricted area or not supposed to be on a break if it's not their designated time. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and the author was being rude. However, the author felt they were on break and needed to use the bathroom urgently, so they didn't want to engage in a lengthy conversation.\n\nBut here's the thing: if the manager explicitly told the author to take a 15-minute break, then the author is supposed to step away from their duties during that time. However, being on break might not mean they can ignore customers entirely. Depending on company policy, breaks might require employees to be off the floor, or maybe they can be approached but should still assist. If the author was in a common area where the customer might naturally approach, they might be expected to help unless it's a scheduled break where they're off the clock and not supposed to work.\n\nAnother angle is the probationary period. The author is more vulnerable here, and any misstep could lead to termination. The manager's reaction might be overly strict, but the company's rules are strict, and the author is being held to high standards.\n\nThe author's justification is that they were on a break and needed to use the bathroom. However, the manager might see that as an excuse for not assisting a customer. The author could have politely directed the customer to the appropriate section without engaging in a conversation. The fact that they walked away might be seen as rude, regardless of the reason.\n\nBut also, the author mentions that similar past interactions turned into long conversations. Maybe they're under stress and need to avoid such situations. However, if the break is an authorized time off, the customer might not know that, and the author's duty is still to assist unless they're in a break room or a specific designated break area.\n\nIn terms of company policy, it's possible that taking a break doesn't mean ignoring customers. The manager's instruction was to take a break, but perhaps the author was supposed to be in the break room rather than roaming the store. If the author was on break but still in the store area, maybe they should have redirected the customer politely.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were on break, but maybe they shouldn't have been in a position where a customer approached them. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and the author was being rude. Alternatively, the author had a legitimate need to take a break and use the bathroom. But the way they handled it\u2014cutting the customer off without assistance\u2014might be considered unprofessional, regardless of the reason.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because even if on a break, the author was in the store area and could have politely assisted the customer. Walking away without offering help could be seen as rude. The manager's decision to write them up might be strict, but the author's action in that moment might be against company policy.\n"
