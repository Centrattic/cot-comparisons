I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store, on a probationary period, and they got written up for being rude to a customer. The key points are that they were on a break, the customer asked a question about where an item was, and the author told her they were on break. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nHmm, the author mentions they were on break, so they weren't supposed to be helping customers. But the customer approached them on the floor, so maybe the customer didn't realize the employee was on a break. The author says that the item in question was right behind the customer, implying that the customer wasn't looking. But even if the customer wasn't looking, the employee's job might include directing customers, even during breaks? Or is that not the case?\n\nThe author explains that they've had past experiences where a simple question turns into a longer conversation. They were in a hurry to use the bathroom and didn't want to engage. But from the manager's perspective, ignoring a customer's question could be seen as rude, regardless of the employee's break status. The manager might expect employees to be helpful even during breaks if they're on company premises. But if the employee had taken their break, maybe they weren't supposed to assist. However, the way the author responded\u2014telling the customer they were on break and walking away\u2014might come off as dismissive or unprofessional.\n\nAlso, the author was under stress because they had been working without a break and were in a probationary period. But the manager had told them to take the break, so maybe the expectation was to take some time off. However, when on break, employees are supposed to avoid work duties. If the customer approached them during a break, the appropriate response might be to inform them they're on a break but still politely direct them to the item. The fact that the item was visible might make the customer's question simple, but the employee's job is to assist regardless. \n\nThe manager's reaction was to write up the employee for being rude and then for arguing. The employee tried to explain their situation, but the manager didn't accept it. The employee might have handled it more politely, even if they were on a break. Instead of saying they were on break and walking away, they could have pointed to the item or said they can't help but the item is nearby. The way they responded might have been perceived as unhelpful or impolite, leading to the write-up. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation professionally, even if they were on a break. They could have been polite while explaining they were on break. The manager's job is to maintain customer service standards, and the employee's response might have breached that. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
