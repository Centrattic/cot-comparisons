I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling the morning rush, didn't get to use the bathroom, then their manager told them to take a break. While on break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which were clearly visible behind the cashier. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, and there's a potential third write-up that could get them fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the manager told them to take a break, then during that break, the cashier might not be expected to assist customers. But sometimes stores have policies where employees are still expected to help even during breaks, especially if they're in the store. However, the cashier was specifically told to take a 15-minute break, so maybe that time is meant to be off-limits for work duties.\n\nThe customer's question seems simple and straightforward. The cashier could have pointed them to the obvious location without much effort. But the cashier was in a hurry to use the bathroom and didn't want to engage in a long conversation. However, by cutting the customer off, they were perceived as rude. From the customer's perspective, being ignored or dismissed might be frustrating, especially if they didn't know the policy. The cashier's manager emphasized \"the customer is always right,\" which is a common policy in retail, even if it's not always fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier was under a lot of stress: working a long shift without a break, already needing the bathroom, and possibly dealing with prior issues. They might have been justified in taking a break and not engaging further. But in a service job, there's an expectation to remain professional and helpful even under stress. Walking away from a customer, even during a break, might not be the best approach. Maybe they could have said they were on break but still provided the information quickly.\n\nThe manager's reaction seems harsh if the cashier was explicitly on break, but the company's policy might require employees to be available even during breaks. The cashier might not be in the wrong if the manager's instructions allowed for a break, but the customer interaction could have been handled better. However, since the manager is enforcing strict policies, the cashier might be in a tough spot regardless of the circumstances.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in the context of a service job where customer service is paramount, the cashier's action of cutting off a customer might be seen as unprofessional, even if the employee was on a break. The manager likely expects employees to handle such situations even during breaks. Therefore, the cashier might be at fault for not handling the interaction more professionally.\n"
