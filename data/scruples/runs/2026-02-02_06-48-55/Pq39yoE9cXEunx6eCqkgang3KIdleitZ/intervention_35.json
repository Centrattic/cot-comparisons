I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store during their probationary period. They were handling the morning rush alone because another cashier called in sick. They didn't get a chance to use the bathroom and finally took a 15-minute break as instructed by their manager. Then, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream Eggs were, which the author felt was a simple question. But since they were on a break and had to go to the bathroom, they told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude, and then again for arguing when explaining their side.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee was on a break, the customer was asking a question, but the employee was supposed to be on break. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, so even during a break, you have to help customers. The employee's reasoning is that they were on a break and needed to use the bathroom, and they didn't want to get into a long conversation.\n\nFirst, company policies usually require employees to be available to assist customers, even during breaks? Or is there some leeway? If the manager told them to take a break, maybe they were supposed to do something else during that time, like use the restroom. But if the customer approached them while they were on break, they might be expected to help. However, the employee might not have realized they were supposed to stay available. But if the break was given to them to take care of personal needs, maybe it's a bit of a conflict.\n\nAlso, the employee was on probation and had previous write-ups. That might mean they're more susceptible to getting fired for mistakes. The manager's reaction seems harsh, but company policy might require strict adherence regardless. The employee's reason for not helping was a valid need, but the company's policy is clear on customer service. So, even if the employee had a legitimate reason, they violated company policy by not assisting the customer during their break. Therefore, the manager's write-up is based on policy, not just the customer's satisfaction.\n\nBut then again, the employee was on a break given to them by the manager. If the break was supposed to be for personal time, maybe the manager should have clarified if they could be interrupted. The employee might not know that they should help customers even during breaks. However, in many retail jobs, breaks are structured so that employees can take care of personal needs without being disturbed. The manager might expect that when on a break, the employee is not to be approached unless it's an emergency, but in this case, the customer approached the employee.\n\nThe employee's previous experience of customers asking multiple questions complicates things, but that's not an excuse for not following policy. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, which is a common policy in retail. So even if the customer's question was simple, the employee was supposed to help. Therefore, the employee was in the wrong for not assisting the customer, even if they had a valid reason. The manager's write-up is based on policy, and the employee's explanation doesn't override that.\n\nOn the other hand, the manager might have been too strict, but the employee still violated policy. The answer here would depend on whether the company's policy allows employees to be on break without assisting customers. If the break was given by the manager, then the employee was supposed to be on break and not working, so the customer's question shouldn't have been directed to them. But if the break was supposed to be taken during a time when another employee was covering their shift, and the customer approached them, maybe the employee is expected to help. But in this case, the employee was the only one handling the morning rush earlier, so maybe the break was meant to be a time to rest, not to be interrupted by customers.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a tricky situation. The employee had a valid need (using the bathroom) and was on a break, but the company's policy might require them to assist customers even during breaks. The manager's strict adherence to policy might be harsh, but the employee violated the policy. Therefore, the employee is in the wrong according to the company's rules, even if it was a difficult situation.\n"
