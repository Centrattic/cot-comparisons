I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a cashier who was on a break but was approached by a customer asking a question. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away, which led to a write-up from the manager.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The cashier was handling the morning rush alone because another cashier was sick. They were finally allowed a 15-minute break but were in a hurry to use the restroom. When a customer asked about Cadbury Cream eggs, which were clearly visible nearby, the cashier said they were on break and left. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, and the cashier got another write-up for arguing.\n\nThe key points here are the company's policies regarding breaks and customer interactions. Typically, during a break, employees are not supposed to be working or assisting customers, right? So if the cashier was on a break, they might be expected to be off-duty. However, the way they responded could be seen as dismissive. The customer might have expected help, even if the cashier was on a break, depending on company policy.\n\nBut the cashier mentioned that previous interactions with customers led to long conversations, which is why they were hesitant. However, in this case, the customer's question was straightforward, and the cashier didn't offer help even though the answer was obvious. Maybe the cashier's frustration from not having bathroom access all morning contributed to their reaction, but that doesn't excuse being rude.\n\nThe manager's response was to write them up for both the initial interaction and arguing. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom might be valid, but they didn't clarify that they were on a break, which is allowed. If the company policy states that breaks are strictly for rest and not for any work-related tasks, then the cashier might be in the wrong for being on break and not being available. However, if the policy allows breaks where employees can step away but still handle urgent customer needs, then the cashier might have violated that.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's perspective. If the cashier was supposed to be available to assist customers even during breaks, or if breaks are strictly off-limits, the cashier's actions might be a policy violation. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is a valid reason, but the way they handled the interaction (being abrupt) could be seen as unprofessional.\n\nIn most retail environments, employees on break are expected to be in a designated break area and not assisting customers. However, if the cashier was in the store area during a break and approached by a customer, the company might expect them to still be available. If the cashier was in a break room, then it's different. The scenario says the cashier was walking through the store, so maybe they were supposed to be on break, which typically means they shouldn't be interacting with customers.\n\nBut the cashier's manager wrote them up for being rude, not necessarily for being on break. The cashier didn't explain they were on break, just said they were on a break and walked away. That could be seen as rude regardless of the situation. Even if on a break, a polite response like \"I'm on a break, but let me check for you\" might have been better. Instead, the cashier was dismissive.\n\nThe fact that the cashier had to use the bathroom adds context, but the manager's response included a second write-up for arguing, which complicates things. The cashier's frustration led to a defensive argument, which is unprofessional. The manager's strict policy might be harsh, but the cashier's actions and response contributed to the write-ups.\n\nSo, considering company policies, the cashier's direct and dismissive response, and the subsequent argument with the manager, the cashier is likely in the wrong. They should have either handled the customer's question politely while on break or, if they couldn't, communicated their need more professionally.\n"
