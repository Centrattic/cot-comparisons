I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a cashier who was handling the morning rush alone because a coworker was sick. They didn't get a bathroom break and then, during their assigned break, a customer approached them asking for a product that was clearly visible nearby. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude and not following up, even though they were on break.\n\nFirst, the employee was on a scheduled break when the customer approached. If the break was approved by the manager, then they were technically off-duty for work tasks. However, depending on store policy, employees might be expected to assist customers even during breaks if they're in the store. So that's a point to consider.\n\nThe customer's question was about a product's location, which was obvious. The cashier's response might have been seen as dismissive, even if they were on break. But the context here is that the employee was under stress, hadn't taken a bathroom break, and had been handling the rush alone. The manager's handling of the situation also seems harsh, as they didn't consider the employee's explanation and added another write-up for arguing.\n\nWorkplace policies vary, but generally, if an employee is on a break, they're not supposed to be working. However, if the store's policy expects employees to be available to assist customers during their shift, even on break, then the employee might be in the wrong. But given that the manager was the one who told them to take the break after being late, and the employee followed the instruction, the manager's oversight could be part of the problem.\n\nThe key factors are the store's policy on breaks and customer interaction during breaks. If the employee was allowed to take the break, then the manager's actions in writing them up without considering the context are problematic. The employee might not be in the wrong if the policy allowed breaks and the manager's actions were unjust. However, if the policy required employees to assist customers even during breaks, then the employee might have been in the wrong for not helping despite being on break.\n\nConsidering the employee's explanation and the manager's rigid enforcement, it seems like the manager's handling was unfair. The customer's question wasn't complex, but the employee's stress and need for a bathroom break are valid. The manager's response in writing up for explaining and not for the initial break policy violation might indicate poor management. So, the employee's actions could be justified if the policy allowed breaks and the manager didn't enforce it appropriately. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
