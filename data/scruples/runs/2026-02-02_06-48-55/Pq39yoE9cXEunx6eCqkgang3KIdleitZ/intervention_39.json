I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on break when a customer asked a question, and they told the customer they were on break instead of answering. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the company's policies. If the employee was explicitly told to take a break, then they shouldn't be expected to assist customers during that time. However, maybe the store expects employees to be helpful even while on break? That's a common issue in retail jobs where breaks are supposed to be uninterrupted, but sometimes employees feel pressured to help.\n\nThe author explains that they were on a probationary period, had a busy morning, and needed the bathroom. They felt the customer wasn't actually looking for the product, so they didn't want to engage in a lengthy conversation. But the manager saw it as rudeness. \n\nIn many workplaces, being on a break usually means you're not supposed to work or assist customers to ensure you can take proper rest. However, there might be exceptions if the team is short-staffed. The author's manager might have expected them to still help, even on a break, especially during a busy time. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author was following the correct procedure. If the manager told them to take a break, then not helping during that time is within policy. However, if the store culture expects employees to be flexible, the manager might have different expectations. The author's action of informing the customer they were on break could be seen as polite but not assisting, which the manager might consider unhelpful or rude.\n\nAlso, the author mentions previous instances where simple questions became lengthy. This shows a pattern of frustration, which might justify their reaction, but it doesn't excuse not following protocol. The manager's response seems strict, but if the policy is clear that breaks should be used for rest and not for work, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the policy allows for some flexibility, then maybe they should have helped.\n\nAnother angle: the author was on a break, so they were doing their job by taking the break as instructed. The manager wrote them up for being rude, but rudeness isn't just about not answering\u2014it's about how you respond. The author didn't act rudely, just excused themselves. The manager might be enforcing strict rules without considering the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer depends on the company's specific policies. If the policy states that breaks are to be used for rest and not for customer interaction, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the policy expects employees to assist customers even during breaks when necessary, then the author is in the wrong. Since the manager is the authority, their interpretation of the policy matters here. The author might need to clarify the policy with the manager or HR to understand their expectations better.\n"
