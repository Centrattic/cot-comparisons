I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they were on break as instructed by their manager, but a customer approached them during the break and asked a question. The employee told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude to the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and expectations of the job. The employee was told to take a 15-minute break, so they were following their manager's orders. Taking a break is part of their scheduled time, which is necessary for them to manage their personal needs, like using the bathroom. That seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, the employee was working in a public-facing role as a cashier. Even when on a break, if they're still within the store premises, maybe the company expects them to be available to assist customers. The manager might have policies that require employees to be helpful at all times unless they're in a designated break area. If the employee was walking through the store during their break and a customer approached them, maybe the company's policy is that employees should still assist customers unless they're off-site or in a specific break room.\n\nThe employee mentioned that they had a history of similar situations where simple questions turned into longer interactions. They were also in a hurry to use the restroom. But when a customer approaches, even if it's a simple question, the standard practice in many retail jobs is to help the customer unless you're in a non-public area. The employee's response was to say they were on break and walk away, which could be seen as not providing service, especially if they were supposed to be on break but still in the store.\n\nThe manager wrote them up for being rude. The employee argues they were on break, but the manager's response was that the customer is always right. The company probably values customer service highly, so even if the employee was on a break, they might be expected to assist unless it's explicitly against company policy to do so during breaks.\n\nAnother point is the probationary period. The employee is on probation, which means they're more vulnerable to being written up. The manager might have strict policies to enforce, and the employee might have crossed a line by not assisting the customer. The employee also argues that the customer wasn't looking for the product and the answer was obvious, but that's subjective. From the customer's perspective, they might have expected the employee to help regardless.\n\nSo, the key factors here are company policy on breaks, the expectation of customer service during breaks, and the employee's adherence to those policies. If the company allows employees to take breaks without assisting customers, then the employee was right. But if the policy is that employees should assist customers unless they're in a break room or off the floor, then the employee was in the wrong.\n\nGiven that the employee was told to take a break but was still in the store, perhaps they should have gone to a designated break area instead of walking around. Being on break doesn't exempt them from all duties if they're still in a public area. The manager's reaction might be based on policy rather than the specific circumstances, especially considering the employee is on probation and the manager is strict about rules.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they were expected to assist the customer despite being on a break, and their refusal could be seen as unprofessional or against company policy, even if their intention was to take a necessary break.\n"
