I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store, had a busy morning, didn't get a break, then when on break, a customer asked a question, and the author told her they were on break instead of helping. The manager wrote them up for being rude and then for arguing when explaining their side.\n\nFirst, the author was on a break. If the manager told them to take a break, then they're supposed to be off-duty during that time. However, in some workplaces, even during a break, employees might still be expected to assist customers if approached. But the key here is the manager's instruction. If the manager explicitly said to take a break, maybe the employee was allowed to not engage.\n\nThe customer asked where a product was. The author's response was that they were on break. The customer might feel ignored or rudely dismissed. But the employee's side is that they were on break and needed to use the bathroom, which is a valid need. The manager's reaction seems harsh because the employee was following the manager's own instruction to take a break.\n\nHowever, there's a conflict in the story. The manager told the employee to take a break, but then later wrote them up for being rude. That's contradictory. Also, the employee was under stress from not having a break all morning and needing to go to the bathroom. The manager's handling of the situation seems poor, especially giving a second write-up for explaining their situation.\n\nBut from a customer service perspective, employees are often expected to be helpful even during breaks if possible. However, if the break is a scheduled one, maybe the employee was within their rights to be on break. The employee might not be in the wrong because they were following the manager's directive and had a legitimate reason to be on break. The manager's actions seem to be the issue here, not the employee's response to the customer.\n"
