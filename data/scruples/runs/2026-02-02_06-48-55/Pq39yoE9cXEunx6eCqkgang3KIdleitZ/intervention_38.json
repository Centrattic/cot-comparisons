I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The employee is a cashier on probation. They were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and finally got to take a 15-minute break. While on break, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were, which were clearly visible nearby. The employee told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the employee was in the wrong. The employee argues they needed the break and had a valid reason for not helping. However, employees are typically expected to be polite and helpful to customers even on breaks, unless the break is a scheduled time where they're off-duty. If the break is scheduled and the employee is allowed to step away, then they might not be at fault. But if they were supposed to be available to assist customers during their shift, even during a break, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nThe manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and the employee was rude by walking away. The employee's defense is that they needed the break and were in the process of taking it. However, the manager might expect employees to handle such interactions politely, even during breaks. The employee's previous behavior (getting into long conversations) adds context, but this time they were trying to avoid that. Still, walking away from a customer, even if they were asking for something obvious, might be seen as unprofessional or rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the employee was on a break, so maybe they weren't supposed to help. But in many workplaces, especially retail, employees are expected to maintain a helpful demeanor even during breaks unless they're in a designated break area. If the employee was in a public area, customers might approach them, and they should respond politely, even if they can't give detailed help. The employee's response was to say they were on break, which is honest, but the way they left might be seen as abrupt.\n\nThe manager's follow-up write-up for arguing complicates things. The employee's explanation about needing a bathroom break might not have been accepted, leading to another write-up. The key here is whether the manager's policy is that employees must be available to assist customers even during breaks, and if the employee violated that policy. If the policy is clear, then the employee is in the wrong. If the policy is unclear, then the manager's strict enforcement might be the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the employee did tell the truth about being on break, but their response to the customer might have been unprofessional. The manager's strict adherence to the \"customer is always right\" policy might have led to the write-up, but the employee's need to take a break is valid. The situation is a bit of a grey area. However, given that the employee was on probation and got written up, it's possible that the manager felt the employee violated company policies, making the employee at least partially at fault. But the manager's handling of the situation could also be questionable.\n"
