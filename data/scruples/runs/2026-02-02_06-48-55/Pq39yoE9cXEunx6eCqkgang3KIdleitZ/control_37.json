I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a cashier who had a busy morning, got a break, was approached by a customer asking where Cadbury Cream eggs were, and told the customer they were on break. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the author was on a break. If they were told by their manager to take a break, then they are allowed to be on a break. Employees usually have the right to their scheduled breaks. So, if the manager explicitly said they could take a break, the author wasn't supposed to be working during that time. The customer approached them while they were on break, not during their shift. So refusing to answer the question because they were on break is understandable.\n\nHowever, the manager wrote them up for being rude. The customer might have felt ignored or dismissed. The way the author handled the situation could be a point. Instead of just walking away, maybe they should have acknowledged the customer, explained they were on break, and pointed them in the general direction if they knew where the product was. The author did mention that the product was clearly visible behind them, so the customer might have seen it. But the author's approach of walking away without any assistance could be seen as rude.\n\nAlso, the author was on probation and had a previous write-up. Probation periods usually require following company policies closely. Even if the author was on a break, the manager might have expected them to assist the customer politely, especially if the break is during a time when employees are expected to be available. The manager's policy of \"customer is always right\" might be strict here, and the author's response might not align with those policies.\n\nAnother angle: the author was very stressed and needed to use the bathroom. That's a valid concern, but the way they handled the customer approach was the issue. If the author had been polite and helpful, even briefly, maybe the situation could have been avoided. The manager's reaction might be harsh, but the author's actions could also be seen as not following procedures. The manager might prioritize customer service over the employee's break in certain situations, especially in a retail environment where assisting customers is part of the job, even during breaks.\n\nSo, while the author had a valid reason for needing a break and the manager's write-up seems strict, the author might have been in the wrong for not handling the customer's request politely. Employees are often expected to maintain a certain level of customer service, even on breaks, if they are in the store. The key point is whether the author was supposed to help the customer despite being on a break. If the break allows employees to leave the area, but they are still on company premises, the expectation might be to be helpful unless the break is a strict time away from work tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not providing assistance to the customer even while on a break, depending on company policy. The manager's strict adherence to \"customer is always right\" could mean that the author should have helped, at least briefly, and explained they were on break but could still assist if possible. So, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) might be appropriate here.\n"
