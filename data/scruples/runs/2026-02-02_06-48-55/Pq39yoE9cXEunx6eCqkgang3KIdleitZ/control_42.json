I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a cashier on probation at a grocery store. They were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, then when on break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The employee told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of the workplace. If the employee was actually on a break, then they're supposed to be off-duty during that time. However, some stores might have policies that employees should still assist customers even during breaks, or maybe there's a protocol for being on break. If the employee was in a break room or on a scheduled break, then maybe they were justified in not helping. But if they were just stepping away from their cashier position but still in the store, the manager might expect them to assist if possible.\n\nAlso, the employee was on probation and had a prior write-up, which affects their job security. The manager's reaction seems harsh, but managers often have to enforce rules strictly, especially with probationary employees. The key here is whether the employee was following the store's policy regarding breaks. If the policy allows employees to step away and not assist customers during breaks, then the employee isn't in the wrong. But if the policy expects employees to be available to help even during breaks, then the employee might be at fault.\n\nThe employee's reasoning is that they needed to use the bathroom and didn't want to get into a long conversation based on past experiences. But the manager didn't accept that explanation. The customer's question was simple, and the employee could have pointed her in the right direction quickly. However, the employee might have been right in not engaging if they were truly on a break and the policy allows it.\n\nIn many workplaces, especially service roles, there's an expectation that employees remain available to assist customers even during short breaks. If the employee wasn't supposed to be on a break or if the break was unscheduled, they're definitely in the wrong. But if the break was scheduled and approved by the manager, then maybe not. However, the manager told them to take a break, so perhaps the timing and location of the break were part of the issue. The employee was in the store, not in the break room, which might have led the customer to approach them. The manager's instruction was to take a 15-minute break, so the employee was following orders, but maybe the manager expects that during breaks, employees are still expected to help if possible.\n\nAlso, the employee's response was to say they were on break and walk away. That could be seen as rude, even if they were on break. A better approach might have been to politely inform the customer they were on break but still direct them to the product. But the employee's main issue was needing to use the bathroom, which is a valid personal need, but they might have handled it differently.\n\nConsidering all this, there are arguments both ways. However, in a service job, there's usually an expectation to assist customers unless explicitly not on duty. If the employee was on a scheduled break, maybe they were in the right. But the manager's perspective is that the employee was being rude, which is a policy violation. The employee's prior write-up complicates things because the manager might be more strict. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the employee not being in the wrong because they were following the manager's instruction to take a break. However, the way they handled the customer's question could be seen as rude regardless. But the manager might not consider the context of needing a bathroom break. The answer could be B (No), the employee isn't in the wrong because they were on a break as instructed, but some might argue A (Yes) because they didn't assist the customer. The community might side with B here.\n"
