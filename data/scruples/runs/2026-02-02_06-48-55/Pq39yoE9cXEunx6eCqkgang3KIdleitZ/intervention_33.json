I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is the cashier was on a break and a customer asked a question. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier argues that they were on break and needed to use the bathroom, but the manager said the customer is always right. \n\nFirst, company policies might require employees to assist customers even during breaks if they're on the premises. If the cashier was told to take a break but left their post, maybe they should have handled the customer differently. But the cashier was on a break, so maybe they're allowed to not help. However, the way they responded might be an issue. Telling the customer they were on break without offering help could be seen as rude. \n\nThe cashier mentions previous experiences where customers ask more than expected, leading to long conversations. Maybe they were trying to avoid that. But in this case, the question was simple. Even if the cashier was on break, perhaps they should have at least pointed the customer in the right direction. \n\nAlso, the manager's reaction is important. The cashier was on probation and this was a write-up. The manager might have strict policies, and the cashier's refusal to help, even if on break, could be against the rules. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier had been working non-stop and was finally given a break. The necessity to use the bathroom is a basic need. But maybe the cashier should have gone to the break room to take their break, not wander around the store. \n\nIn many workplaces, even on break, employees are expected to be in a designated area. If the cashier was walking through the store, maybe they weren't supposed to be there. So when approached, they might have been in a gray area. \n\nThe key points are: company policy on breaks, how to handle customer inquiries during breaks, and the manager's rules. If the policy allows for taking breaks and not helping customers, then the cashier isn't wrong. But if the policy expects employees to assist when on the floor, even during breaks, then they are in the wrong. \n\nSince the cashier was given permission to take a break by the manager but then got written up for not helping, it's possible the manager's policy is strict. The cashier might have violated a rule by not assisting, even if on break. So the cashier might be in the wrong here. But maybe the manager overstepped. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards yes, the cashier is in the wrong for not handling the customer appropriately even if on break. \n\nAnswer A.\n"
