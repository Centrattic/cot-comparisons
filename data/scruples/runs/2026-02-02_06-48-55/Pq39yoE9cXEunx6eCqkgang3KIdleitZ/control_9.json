I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a cashier who was on break and didn't answer a customer's question, leading to a write-up.\n\nFirst, the cashier was handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and the manager told them to take a 15-minute break. When a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, the cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier argues that they had to use the bathroom and that similar situations in the past led to longer conversations.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the context of the break, the manager's instructions, and the customer interaction. The cashier was on a scheduled break, so refusing to answer might be justified. However, being on break doesn't mean they can completely ignore customers. Maybe they should have pointed the customer to the obvious location (since there were many eggs nearby) quickly and then excused themselves.\n\nThe manager's reaction seems strict. The cashier wasn't necessarily being rude, just trying to take their break. The write-up for arguing might be an issue too. The cashier was explaining, not arguing. \n\nI think the cashier is not entirely in the wrong. They had a valid reason for needing a break and the customer's question was straightforward. However, maybe they could have handled it more politely, like saying they're on break but pointing the way. So the manager's response might be harsh. Probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
