I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store, and they were handling the morning rush alone because a coworker called in sick. They didn't get a bathroom break, then their manager told them to take a 15-minute break. When they were walking through the store on their break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, and the author said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude and for arguing when they explained.\n\nFirst, the author was on a break as instructed by the manager. If they were supposed to take a break, then maybe they had the right to be off-duty. But the customer approached them, and the author didn't help. But the author's reason was that they really needed to go to the bathroom and didn't want to get into a long conversation like they have in the past. Also, they mentioned that the Cadbury Cream eggs were obviously nearby, so the customer didn't need much help. \n\nThe manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and the author was rude. The author argues that they were on break and had valid reasons. Now, the question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of workplace policies, if the manager told them to take a break, then during that break time, they might not be expected to assist customers. But usually, breaks are for rest and bathroom breaks, not for being on the floor. However, the manager might have policies where employees are supposed to be available even during breaks if needed. \n\nAnother angle: the author's manager gave them a break, but maybe they were supposed to inform the customer they were on break and direct them to another resource, like a different employee or pointing them in the right direction. Instead, the author just walked away, which could be seen as unhelpful or rude. The customer might not know the store well, even if it's obvious to the employee. \n\nBut the author was in a tough spot, needing to use the bathroom and having had a stressful morning. Their manager was strict, and the written up for arguing when explaining their situation. The key here is whether the manager's policy overrides the employee's break time. If the store's policy says that during breaks, employees are still expected to help customers, then the author was in the wrong. If the policy allows for breaks without interruptions, then the manager is being unreasonable.\n\nLooking at the author's justification: they were on a break, had a valid reason to need the bathroom, and the customer's question was simple. However, refusing to help at all, even to direct them, could be seen as unprofessional. Maybe the right approach would have been to say, \"I'm on break now, but the Cadbury Cream eggs are right behind you,\" instead of walking away. But the author didn't do that. \n\nThe manager's reaction might be based on strict adherence to the \"customer is always right\" policy, which values customer service over employee breaks. However, the author's need for a bathroom break is a basic right, and if they didn't have a chance to take one before the break, that's a management issue. \n\nSo considering all factors, the author might have been within their rights to be on break, but perhaps handled the customer interaction poorly. However, the manager's response was harsh, especially writing up for explaining. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong. If the policy allows breaks without helping customers, then the author is not in the wrong. If the policy expects help during breaks, then they are. Since the scenario doesn't specify the policy, but the manager's reaction is strict, it's a judgment call. \n\nBut given that the author was given the break by the manager, perhaps during that time they were supposed to be off the floor. If they were walking through the store, maybe they should have been in a break area. If they were on the sales floor, employees are usually expected to be available. The author's action of walking away might not be the best approach, but the manager's handling of the situation might also be an issue. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if the manager allowed the break, but their failure to assist the customer in any way (even pointing them in the right direction) could be seen as rude. However, the manager's strictness in writing them up for explaining their situation might be the bigger issue here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the store's policy is that you can't help customers during breaks, then no. If the policy is that you can't walk away from a customer even on break, then yes. Since the manager said \"take a 15-minute break,\" maybe the author was allowed to take a break, but the manager might have expected them to still be helpful. However, the author was in a physical need situation. \n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on whether the break time is considered off-duty for all tasks. If the author was on a scheduled break, they are not supposed to be working, which includes helping customers. But walking through the store on a break isn't helping customers, so the manager might have expected them to be in a break area. However, the customer approached them, and the author was on a break, so technically not supposed to help. The manager's write-up might be based on the employee being on the floor during a break, which is against policy. But the author's reason for being on a break was to use the bathroom, which is a valid need. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong if the break was properly taken, but the manager's handling is the issue. However, if the store's policy requires employees to be in break areas during breaks, then the author was in the wrong by being on the sales floor. Since the scenario doesn't specify the policy, but the manager allowed the break, the author's action of walking through the store and then refusing to help might be seen as within their rights if the break was allowed. However, the manager's decision to write them up for not assisting a customer during a break is harsh. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is the asshole. If the author was on a break and the manager allowed it, then they might not be in the wrong. However, the manager might have a policy against being on the sales floor during breaks. If the author was supposed to be in the break room, then they were in the wrong by being on the floor. Since the author was told to take a break and went through the store, maybe they were supposed to be in a designated area. \n\nGiven all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because even if they were on a break, being on the sales floor and refusing to assist a customer could be against company policy. However, the manager's response was also excessive. But according to the given scenario, the manager's policy is \"customer is always right,\" so the author's refusal to help might be deemed unprofessional, hence AITA. \n\nBut some might argue that the author had valid reasons and the manager was being too strict. However, in a typical workplace setting, if you're on a break, you're supposed to be off-duty, and the manager would be the one at fault for not allowing proper breaks. However, if the author was on the sales floor during a break, maybe they were violating a policy. \n\nConsidering all these points, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they were on the sales floor during a break and refused to assist a customer, which could be against company policy. However, the manager's handling might be part of the issue as well. But according to the question, the focus is on whether the author is in the wrong. So if the company policy states that you can't be on the sales floor during a break, then the author is wrong. If not, then maybe not. Since the scenario doesn't specify, but the manager was strict, it's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the manager told them to take a break, the author might have been allowed to be off the floor. However, the customer approached them, and the author refused to help, which could be seen as rude even if on a break. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
