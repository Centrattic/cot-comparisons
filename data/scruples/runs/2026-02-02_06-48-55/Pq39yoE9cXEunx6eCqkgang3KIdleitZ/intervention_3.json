I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a cashier who was on a break and refused to help a customer, leading to a write-up. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, the author was working alone during the morning rush and didn't get a bathroom break. Then, when their manager told them to take a 15-minute break, they were walking through the store when a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream Eggs were. The author says that the eggs were clearly visible behind them, implying the customer wasn't even looking. They responded by saying they were on break and walked away. \n\nThe manager then wrote them up for being rude. The author argues that they needed the break badly and that past experiences showed customers might ask multiple questions, not just one. So they were trying to avoid a longer conversation.\n\nHmm. On one hand, when an employee is on break, they're not supposed to be helping customers. But if the customer approached them while they were in the store, maybe the customer thought they were still working. The author's manager might have rules about not engaging with customers during breaks. If the author was on a scheduled break, then walking away and not helping could be against company policy. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they were on probation and had a write-up. If the company policy is strict about customer service and employees are expected to assist even during breaks, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the manager explicitly told them to take a break and it's allowed to step away from customers during that time, then maybe not. \n\nAnother angle: the customer didn't know the product was there. Even if it was visible, the customer might not have known where to look. The author's response could be seen as dismissive. Maybe they should have pointed it out instead of cutting them off. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they needed the break and had a history of getting into long conversations. However, the manager's reaction was harsh, combining two write-ups. The author's defense might not hold up if the policy is clear that breaks are non-negotiable and employees must not engage with customers during that time. \n\nSo, if the company expects employees to be available to help customers even during breaks, then the author is wrong. If the break is a valid time to not engage, then maybe not. The key is company policy. Since the author's manager is strict and wrote them up, it's possible the policy is that breaks are for rest and not for customer interaction. Therefore, the author's action was a violation of policy, making them the asshole. \n\nAlternatively, if the customer approached them while they were on break and the employee wasn't supposed to help, then the customer might have been confused. But the employee should have politely directed them to someone else, not just walked away. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow company protocol for handling customer inquiries during breaks, even if their intentions were to take a necessary break. The manager's actions were based on policy, and the author's response was seen as rude, which could be a valid reason for a write-up. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
