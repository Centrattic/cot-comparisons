I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is a cashier at a grocery store, on a probationary period. They had a busy morning, handled the rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom. Then their manager told them to take a 15-minute break. While on that break, a customer approached and asked about Cadbury Cream Eggs, which were right behind the cashier. The cashier told the customer they were on break instead of answering. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, even though the cashier was on a break and in a hurry to use the bathroom.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the cashier was justified in not helping the customer during their break. The company policy probably requires employees to be available to assist customers unless they're in a break. Even if the cashier was on a break, if the break is within the work premises, they might still be expected to check on a customer. Proximity to the breakroom might matter. Also, the manager's perspective is important here; if the manager told them to take a break, maybe they shouldn't have been on the floor. But the cashier was in a hurry to use the bathroom, which is a basic need.\n\nBut from a workplace policy standpoint, if the employee is on a break, maybe they're supposed to be off-task. However, some companies have rules that during breaks, employees should be in a designated area. If the cashier was walking through the store on a break, maybe they're still within the work area and should be helping. But the customer approached them, and the cashier was on a break. The manager might see that as not following protocol.\n\nThe cashier's reasoning was that they were on a break and didn't want to get into a long conversation. The customer didn't look like they had looked, so maybe the cashier thought the answer was obvious. But even if the answer is obvious, the customer asked, and the cashier didn't respond. The manager's strict adherence to \"customer is always right\" could lead to the write-up.\n\nBut the cashier was on a break. If the break is meant to be a time to step away from work duties, then maybe the manager was wrong to expect the cashier to help. However, sometimes breaks are still within the work environment, and employees might be expected to assist if they're in the area. The manager might have a policy that even during breaks, employees should be available if they're not in the breakroom.\n\nThe cashier was also in a probationary period, which might make the manager more strict. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is understandable, but the manager didn't accept that. The cashier was written up for arguing, which complicates things. The cashier was just explaining, but the manager saw it as arguing, which is a common conflict in workplace dynamics.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The cashier was following the manager's order to take a break but was still in the store where customers might approach. The manager might have expected the cashier to be in the breakroom. The cashier's actions could be seen as not following break protocol, hence the write-up. However, the cashier's need to use the bathroom is a valid concern, and the manager's handling of the situation could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, the answer depends on company policies. If the policy allows for walking around during a break but expects employees to assist customers if approached, then the cashier was in the wrong. If the policy allows for a break where the employee can step away from duties, then the manager was wrong. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that the manager wrote them up, the company likely expects employees to be available even during breaks when in the store. Therefore, the cashier might be in the wrong. But the manager's strictness and the probationary period add context. However, the cashier was following the manager's instruction to take a break, so maybe the manager is at fault for not clarifying break areas or being too strict. But the cashier did not answer a customer question during a break, which the manager found unacceptable. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The cashier was on a break. If the break is supposed to be in the breakroom, then being on the floor during the break is against policy. If the cashier was walking through the store on a break, maybe the manager expected them to be in the breakroom. The cashier's justification is that they needed to use the bathroom, but the manager might see that as an excuse. The key point is whether the cashier was allowed to be on the floor during their break. If not, then the cashier was in the wrong. If they were allowed, then the manager was wrong to write them up. The story doesn't specify company policy, but the manager's reaction suggests that the cashier was in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
