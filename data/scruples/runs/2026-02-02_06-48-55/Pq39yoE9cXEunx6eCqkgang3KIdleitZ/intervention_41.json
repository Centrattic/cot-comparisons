I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a cashier at a grocery store during a busy morning. The writer was handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and when their manager told them to take a break, they were approached by a customer asking about Cadbury Cream eggs. The writer told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude. The writer is upset because they\u2019re on probation and this could lead to getting fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. Most jobs, especially in retail, have policies about when employees can take breaks and how they interact with customers. If the manager instructed the employee to take a break, then technically they were supposed to be on break. Even if the employee was on a break, approaching a customer for help might be seen as not being attentive to their duties. However, if the employee was on a scheduled break, they might not be expected to assist customers then.\n\nBut wait, the employee was told to take a break after handling the morning rush. The manager might have expected the employee to be in the break room or an area not interacting with customers. If the employee was walking through the store during their break, maybe they were still in a public area where they could encounter customers. However, the company's policy probably expects employees to be off the floor and not engaging with customers during their breaks. If the employee was on break, they shouldn't be answering customer questions.\n\nAnother angle is the stress the employee was under. They were handling the rush alone, had to pee, and were on probation. They might have been overwhelmed and wanted to take their break immediately. But even with that stress, the company's policy likely states that when on break, employees shouldn't engage with customers. The manager's reaction might be strict, but if the policy is clear, the employee might have violated it regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe customer's perspective is also important. If the customer approached the employee during a break, the employee's refusal to help could be seen as rude, especially if the employee is supposed to be available during their scheduled hours unless on a break. However, if the employee was on a break, they might have the right to not assist customers then.\n\nBut the key here is the company's policy. If the manager said the employee was on break, then they were supposed to not interact with customers. The employee's actions, even if they were on break, could be seen as not following procedure. The manager might have a point in writing them up for not adhering to break policies, even if the reason was understandable. However, the manager's handling of the situation could also be questioned if the policy wasn't clearly communicated.\n\nIn terms of the employee's explanation about not wanting to engage in a long conversation, maybe they had past experiences where simple questions turned into longer interactions. But if they were on break, the correct action would be to direct the customer to a colleague or to the manager, not to walk away. Walking away might be seen as rude regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, considering all that, the employee might be in the wrong for not following the break policy and for how they handled the customer interaction. The manager's strict enforcement could be strict, but if the policy is clear, the employee violated it. However, the manager's additional write-up for \"arguing\" when the employee was just explaining their situation adds another layer. But the initial action of refusing to help a customer while on break could be a policy violation, making the employee at least partially at fault.\n"
