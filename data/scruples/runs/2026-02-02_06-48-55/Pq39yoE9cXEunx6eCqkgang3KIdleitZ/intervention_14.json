I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the cashier, the author, was in the wrong when they told a customer they were on break instead of helping her find the Cadbury Cream Eggs.\n\nFirst, the situation: The cashier had a tough morning, handling the rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, and finally got a break. When the customer approached, the cashier told her they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier argues that they were on break and needed to take care of personal needs, and that past experiences made them wary of engaging in long conversations.\n\nNow, thinking about company policies. Typically, when an employee is on a scheduled break, they are supposed to be off-duty and not helping customers. However, sometimes stores might expect employees to be available unless they're in a private break area. If the cashier was on a break and visible in the store, the customer might not know they're on break. If the cashier didn't clearly indicate they were on break (like stepping into a break room), then the customer might expect them to help since they're still on the premises. But if the cashier was in the break room, then maybe it's different.\n\nAlso, the manager's perspective: The manager might have a policy that during breaks, employees shouldn't engage with customers unless it's an emergency. However, the customer is a priority, and the manager might think the cashier should have helped. The cashier's reason for needing a break\u2014because they hadn't taken one and had to use the bathroom\u2014could be valid, but the manager might not see it that way.\n\nThe cashier's past experiences with customers asking multiple questions could make them cautious, but that doesn't excuse not helping if they're supposed to be available. The manager wrote them up for being rude, so according to company policy, even if the cashier was stressed, they might be expected to handle customer inquiries regardless of their personal situation.\n\nAnother angle: The customer didn't ask for a complex question. It was a simple one about product location. If the cashier was on break, maybe they should have directed the customer to another employee or a location map. But if they were in the middle of their break and not supposed to be working, then maybe they didn't have to help. The key is whether the break was visible or the cashier was supposed to be on break at that time.\n\nSo, if the cashier was on a scheduled break, maybe they were in the right. But if they were supposed to be working (even if they were exhausted), then they might be in the wrong. The manager's reaction suggests that even if they were on a break, they shouldn't have been dismissive or rude. The cashier's response of saying they were on break might have been abrupt and not helpful, leading to the write-up.\n\nIn many workplaces, especially in retail, there's an expectation that employees are accessible to customers unless they're in a designated break area. If the cashier was walking through the store during their break, they might still be expected to assist. However, if the break was allowed by the manager and the cashier was following protocol, then it's a different story. The cashier's need to use the bathroom is a valid personal need, but the way they handled the customer's request might have been unprofessional.\n\nSo considering all that, the cashier might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the customer's request politely and instead dismissed her, leading to a write-up. Even if they were on a break, they should have found a way to assist the customer, maybe by directing her to another employee or using a store map. The manager's policy is that the customer is always right, and the cashier's response was rude, regardless of their personal situation.\n"
