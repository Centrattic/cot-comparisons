I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they're a cashier at a grocery store, on probation, and they got written up for being rude. The key event was when a customer approached them on the floor while they were on break and asked about Cadbury Cream eggs. The employee told the customer they were on break and walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the company's policies. The manager told them to take a 15-minute break, so they were technically on break at that time. But as an employee, do they have a responsibility to help customers even during a break? Some places might expect employees to be available for customer assistance at all times, even during breaks. Others might have more flexible policies. Since the manager later said it didn't matter that they were on break, it seems like the company expects employees to assist customers regardless of their scheduled break.\n\nNext, the employee was desperate to use the bathroom because they hadn't been able to during the morning rush. That adds a layer of stress and urgency. However, the manager had already given them the break, so they should have been able to go to the bathroom during that time. The employee might have felt rushed to get to the bathroom, but the issue is how they handled the customer interaction.\n\nThe customer approached them directly, and the employee dismissed them without offering help. Even if the customer wasn't looking, the employee's response of saying they were on break might be seen as not providing adequate assistance. The customer didn't know the employee was on a break, so the employee's duty to help might still apply. \n\nAlso, the manager's reaction was to write them up for being rude and then again for arguing. The employee's explanation about needing to use the bathroom might not be sufficient if the manager strictly enforces the rule that the customer is always right. However, the employee was on a break, which they were told to take, so there's a conflict between the manager's instruction and the customer service expectation.\n\nThe probationary period is a factor too. Since they're on probation, they might be held to higher standards, and any infractions could lead to termination. The manager's warning about a third write-up adds pressure, but the employee's actions might still be considered unprofessional.\n\nIn summary, the employee was on a break but didn't handle the customer interaction appropriately by not offering assistance. Even if they were stressed, the company's policy likely requires them to assist customers regardless of breaks. The manager's strict enforcement of the policy might lead others to think the employee was in the wrong. However, the employee's explanation about needing to use the bathroom could be seen as a mitigating factor. It's a bit of a gray area, but the company's rules probably prioritize customer service over personal breaks, so the employee might be in the wrong.\n"
