I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they're a cashier at a grocery store on probation with a union. They had a busy morning rush and didn't get to go to the bathroom. The manager told them to take a 15-minute break, so they went to the break room. But while walking through the store, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The author says that because there were obvious Cadbury products around, they assumed the customer hadn't actually looked, so they told her they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, and they argue it was necessary because they needed the bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and expectations at the workplace. The author was on a break, so they might not be supposed to help customers during that time. If the manager told them to take a break, but they were still on the premises and could be seen as working or still in the store, maybe they should have handled the situation differently. However, the manager relieved them so they could take a break, implying they were allowed to step away from their duties.\n\nBut when the customer approached, the author was on break, so they could choose not to help. However, the customer might not know they're on break. The author's justification is that they needed to use the bathroom and didn't want to get into a long conversation. But the manager saw it as rude. The key points here are the company's policy on breaks and how employees are expected to handle customer interactions during those times. If the break is paid, maybe they can leave the floor entirely. If it's unpaid, perhaps they should still be available. But since the manager told them to take the break, maybe the author was allowed to be away from the register.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption the author made about the customer. They thought the customer hadn't looked, but maybe that's not a valid reason to ignore them. Even if the question seems simple, the customer might genuinely be looking and just missed them. The author's response could be seen as dismissive because they didn't point the customer to where the product is, even if they were on break.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was on probation and a union member might add pressure. Being on probation means the manager has more leeway to enforce rules, and a write-up could lead to termination. The author's actions might have violated company policies about customer service, even if they had a good reason. The manager's response might be strict because of the probationary period.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. They were following the manager's instruction to take a break, which is a valid reason to step away. However, if the policy states that employees should still assist customers during breaks (like if breaks are unpaid and they're still on duty), then not helping could be an issue. The author's explanation about needing the bathroom is valid, but the way they handled the interaction might have been unprofessional. Instead of just walking away, they could have politely directed the customer to the product or told them they were on break but could help after returning from break. Walking away without providing any assistance might be seen as rude, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author's actions, while understandable due to the situation, might not align with expected customer service behavior, leading to the write-up. So, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because even if they were on break, the manner in which they responded to the customer could be considered unprofessional. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the break was permitted and they had a right to step away. I need to check if taking a break means they can ignore customers. But the manager's instruction was to take a break, so if the customer approached during that time, the proper protocol would be to tell them they're on break and ask them to wait or direct them to another cashier. The author didn't do that, just left, which might be the problem. So AITA? Probably A, because the response was dismissive and didn't attempt to help, even if they were on a break. The manager's strictness might be part of the job, but the action taken by the author could be seen as unprofessional regardless of their reason.\n"
