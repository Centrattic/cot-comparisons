I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they were a cashier on break, got asked a question by a customer, told the customer they were on break, and then got written up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. Employees usually have scheduled breaks, right? So if the manager told them to take a break, then they are allowed to be on break. But wait, sometimes there are policies about where you can be during a break. If the cashier was supposed to be off the floor during a break, maybe they shouldn't be walking around. But the story says they were on a break and walking through the store when the customer approached them. Maybe the policy allows breaks outside of the register but not interacting with customers?\n\nThen there's the interaction with the customer. The cashier said they were on break, which is their right. But maybe the customer felt ignored or the manager felt it was rude. The cashier mentioned that past experiences made them avoid long conversations because they needed to use the bathroom. But even if that's true, the manager might still hold them accountable for not answering the customer's question.\n\nThe manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing when they explained. However, the cashier was being polite, saying they were on break. The manager's response might be too strict, especially considering the employee's probationary period. But the manager's job is to enforce company policies, which often prioritize customer satisfaction. Even if the employee had a good reason, if the policy states that employees must answer questions unless they're at their workstation, then the cashier might have violated that.\n\nAnother point: the cashier handled the morning rush alone without a break, leading to needing the bathroom badly. That adds context about their stress and urgency. However, the company's policies might still require employees to be available to customers unless officially on break. If the cashier was on a break and not supposed to interact, then they might be right. But if the break was supposed to be in a specific area or not during customer interactions, then maybe they were in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the manager's reaction seems harsh. Writing someone up for being on break and explaining their situation could indicate poor management, but the employee's probationary status means they have to follow all policies strictly. If the company policy allows for breaks and being on break means not engaging with customers, then the cashier is in the right. If the policy says they should be available even during breaks, then the cashier is wrong.\n\nIn summary, the cashier told the customer they were on break, which is their right. However, depending on the company's specific policies about break times and interactions, the cashier might have violated something. The manager's response was strict, but if the policy is clear, the cashier could be at fault. However, considering the context of needing to use the bathroom and the manager's harshness, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might hinge on the specific workplace policies, which aren't fully detailed here. But since the cashier was told to take the break and was on break, maybe they're not wrong. Alternatively, if the policy requires being available during breaks, they are wrong.\n"
