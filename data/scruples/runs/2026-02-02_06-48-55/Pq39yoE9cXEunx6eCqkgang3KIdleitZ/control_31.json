I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the cashier was in the wrong when they told a customer they were on break instead of answering her question. The cashier was working a busy shift, had to handle the morning rush alone, and hadn't taken a break or bathroom time. Their manager finally told them to take a 15-minute break, so they went to do that. Then a customer stopped them to ask where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which the cashier felt was a simple question but didn't answer because they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing when they explained.\n\nFirst, the key points are the probationary period, the manager's instructions, the physical need to use the bathroom, and the customer interaction. The cashier was on a break as instructed, so maybe they were in the right to not answer. However, depending on company policy, breaks might require being in a specific area or not engaging with customers. If the cashier was on a break, they shouldn't be assisting customers, but if they were still in the store and approached, maybe they were expected to help regardless. \n\nThe manager's reaction seems harsh, but if the policy is that customers always come first, even during breaks, then the cashier might be at fault. On the other hand, the cashier's need to take a necessary break (to use the bathroom) is understandable. The previous experience with customers leading to long conversations adds context. The cashier's explanation might not have been enough, but the manager's handling could be questionable.\n\nIn terms of company policies, if the break means stepping away from work duties, then the cashier was correct. But if being on break doesn't exempt from customer assistance, then they were wrong. The situation is a bit ambiguous without knowing the exact policies. However, the cashier was following the manager's order to take a break, so their actions were justified. The manager's write-ups seem excessive given the circumstances.\n"
