I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They were a cashier on probation, handling a morning rush without a bathroom break. Their manager told them to take a 15-minute break, and while they were on break, a customer asked for Cadbury Cream eggs. The writer said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. When an employee is on a break, they're typically supposed to be off the floor and not interacting with customers. But the customer approached the employee while they were on break. The employee was in the store, so maybe the customer assumed they were still working. The employee tried to explain they were on break, which might be in line with policy.\n\nThe manager wrote them up because the customer felt ignored or rude. But the employee was following the break instructions from the manager. Also, the employee was dealing with high stress, needing to use the bathroom, and had past experiences where simple questions led to longer interactions. The manager might have been strict about customer complaints, but the employee's situation was about following the break given by the manager.\n\nThe key points are: was the employee on break as instructed, and did they handle the customer appropriately? If the break meant they shouldn't be approached, then the employee might be in the right. However, if being on break still requires them to assist customers, then they might be at fault. But given that the manager told them to take the break, the employee's actions were following the manager's orders. The manager's subsequent write-up for being on break seems contradictory.\n\nAlso, the probationary period and the threat of termination add context. The employee's need to use the bathroom is a valid concern. The manager's reaction of writing up for explaining their situation could be seen as unfair. The employee wasn't arguing but explaining their situation, which the manager shouldn't penalize.\n\nSo, considering all that, the employee might not be in the wrong. They were following their manager's instructions, had a valid reason for needing a break, and the manager's response was overly harsh. The customer might have approached the employee because they didn't realize they were on break. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
