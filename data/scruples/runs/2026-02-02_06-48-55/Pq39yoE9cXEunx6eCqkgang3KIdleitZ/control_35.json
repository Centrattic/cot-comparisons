I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to figure out if they were in the wrong for telling a customer they were on break instead of answering a question. The situation involves a cashier who was handling a busy morning rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, and was finally allowed a break by their manager. Then a customer approached and asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which the cashier found odd because they were right behind her. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. The manager said to take a break, so maybe the cashier was allowed to be on break. But if the policy states that employees can't be on break while customers are in the store, then walking away might be an issue. However, if the manager told them to take the break, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nNext, the stress and circumstances. The cashier was overworked, handling the rush alone, and hadn't had a break since 5:30 AM. The physical need for the bathroom is a real concern. The cashier might have been under a lot of stress, which could affect their judgment. However, even in stressful situations, employees usually need to follow protocols when interacting with customers.\n\nThe customer's question was about a product that was clearly visible, which the cashier found suspicious. The cashier might have been annoyed, thinking the customer wasn't actually looking. But the cashier's response was to say they were on break and leave, which could be seen as rude or dismissive. However, if the cashier was explicitly told they could take a break, there might be some leeway.\n\nThe manager's reaction is also a point. Writing up for being on break and for explaining the situation could indicate a strict policy enforcement. The cashier was on probation, so any mistake might be more impactful. The manager's response seems harsh, but management has the authority to enforce rules regardless of the employee's circumstances.\n\nIn terms of whether the cashier was wrong, it's a balance between following company policy and the immediate personal needs. If the break was authorized, then the cashier might be justified in not helping. However, if the policy prohibits being on break when customers are around, then the cashier was in violation. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is a valid human need, but the manager's rules take precedence in a professional setting.\n\nConsidering all factors, the cashier might have followed the manager's instruction to take a break, so they weren't strictly at fault. However, walking away from a customer without offering any assistance could be seen as unprofessional. The manager's response is strict, but the cashier's actions might be within the given instructions. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), given the manager's role in allowing the break and the cashier's adherence to that instruction.\n"
