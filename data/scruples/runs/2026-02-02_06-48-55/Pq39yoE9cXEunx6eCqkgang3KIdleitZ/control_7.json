I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a cashier who was on break and was approached by a customer asking a question. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away, leading to a write-up. The cashier is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the cashier was handling the morning rush alone because a coworker was sick. They didn't get a bathroom break and finally got permission from their manager to take a 15-minute break. While on break, a customer stops them to ask where Cadbury Cream eggs are. The cashier says they're on break and walks away, leading to a write-up for being rude.\n\nThe manager's perspective is important here. The company policy likely states that employees should be attentive to customers even during breaks, especially if they're still in a public area of the store. Even if the cashier was on break, if they were in a space where they could assist, they might be expected to help. The manager might have considered the cashier's refusal to answer the customer as unprofessional, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe cashier's argument is that they needed to take a bathroom break and didn't want to engage in a potential lengthy conversation. However, the manager might not see past the immediate action of not assisting the customer, regardless of the underlying stress or need for a break. The policy probably prioritizes customer service over personal breaks when the employee is in the store during their shift, even if the break is permitted.\n\nAlso, the tone of the cashier's response could be an issue. Telling the customer they're on break and walking away might come off as dismissive, even if the cashier was stressed. The manager might have expected a different approach, like politely explaining they can't help and directing the customer to another resource, like a different employee or a sign.\n\nThe cashier's probationary period and previous write-ups add to the tension. The manager might be stricter in giving write-ups to ensure the cashier meets the job's standards, especially during probation. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom and arguing might have been seen as not following protocol, leading to the second write-up.\n\nSo, while the cashier had a legitimate need and stress, the company's policy and the manager's expectations might mean that the cashier was in the wrong for not assisting the customer, regardless of the circumstances. Hence, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
