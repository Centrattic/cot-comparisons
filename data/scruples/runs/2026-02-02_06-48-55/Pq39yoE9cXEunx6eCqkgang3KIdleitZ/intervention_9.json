I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a cashier who was on break but a customer asked a question, and the cashier told them they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the cashier was on a break, they're supposed to be off duty. But maybe the policy is that employees should be available to help customers even during breaks? Or perhaps the manager expected them to still assist despite being on a break. That's a key point. If the cashier explicitly said they were on break, then maybe they were following the rule to not work during break time. But if the policy says employees should help customers even on break, then the cashier might be in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the context of the customer's question. The customer asked where Cadbury Cream Eggs were, which the cashier thought was a simple question. The cashier felt it wasn't necessary to engage in a long conversation, but the manager saw it as rude. Maybe the cashier's response was abrupt, making it seem unhelpful. Even if the cashier was on break, the way they responded might have been perceived as unprofessional. \n\nAlso, the cashier was in a probationary period and had prior write-ups. That adds pressure because the manager is strict about rules. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom might be a valid reason for wanting a break, but the manager didn't accept it. The cashier's argument that past interactions were longer could be a defense, but maybe the manager prioritized customer service over the cashier's personal needs.\n\nAnother angle: in many jobs, especially retail, employees are expected to assist customers even during breaks if needed. If the cashier was on a break but in the store, they might still be expected to help unless they're clearly off the floor. The manager might view the cashier's refusal as neglecting customer service, which is a priority in retail environments.\n\nAlso, the cashier's tone and explanation about the situation might have been defensive or dismissive. Instead of just saying they're on break, maybe a more polite or apologetic response could have been better. The manager's reaction suggests that the cashier's approach was unprofessional, leading to the write-up.\n\nConsidering all this, the cashier might have violated company policy by not assisting the customer, even if they were on a break. The manager's stance of \"customer is always right\" is common in retail, so the cashier's refusal could be seen as not prioritizing customer service adequately. Therefore, the cashier might be at fault here.\n"
