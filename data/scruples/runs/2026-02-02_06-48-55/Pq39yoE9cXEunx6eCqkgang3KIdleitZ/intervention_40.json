I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling a rush, didn't get to go to the bathroom, then were told to take a break. While on that break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The store was decorated with pastel Easter stuff, so maybe the eggs were obvious. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. Then the manager wrote them up for being rude, and also wrote up again for arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider employment policies. If the employee was told to take a break, maybe they're supposed to be off-duty and not helping customers. But sometimes in stores, even on break, employees might still be expected to assist if needed. But if the manager explicitly said they could take a break, maybe they were allowed to step away.\n\nHowever, the way the cashier handled it might be an issue. If the customer approached them, and the cashier was supposed to be on break, maybe they should have directed the customer to a colleague or helped them quickly. Walking away without answering could be seen as rude, regardless of the reason. The customer probably expected help, and the cashier's refusal might look unprofessional.\n\nThe cashier had a valid reason\u2014they were in need of going to the bathroom and had been working non-stop. But the manager's policy is that the customer is always right, and arguing might have made things worse. The cashier might not have communicated clearly that they were on a break and needed to step away, perhaps leading to misunderstanding.\n\nBut in a union setting, there might be specific rules about breaks and how they're handled. If the manager told them to take a break, perhaps they were supposed to be free from duties. However, in some workplaces, especially during busy times, employees might still be expected to assist even on break. The manager might have felt the cashier should have helped.\n\nSo, on one side, the cashier had a legitimate need to take a break and use the bathroom. On the other, the customer was seeking information and the cashier didn't help, leading to a write-up. The cashier could have explained they were on break more politely or asked a colleague. The manager's strict enforcement of \"customer is always right\" might not account for employee needs, but the cashier's response might not have been the best approach.\n\nI think the cashier might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the customer's request in a professional manner, even if they were on break. However, if the manager's policy was that breaks are strictly for rest, then the cashier wasn't supposed to help, and the manager's write-up is unfair. But given the manager's perspective and the policy, the cashier's action might be seen as rude regardless of the reason. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
