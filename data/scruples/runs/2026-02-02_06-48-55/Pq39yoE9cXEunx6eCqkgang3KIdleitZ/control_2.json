I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier told a customer they were on a break instead of answering a question, and then got written up for it. The cashier is in a probationary period, which adds some pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The cashier was handling the morning rush alone because a coworker was sick. They didn't get a chance to use the bathroom and were finally allowed a 15-minute break by the manager. While on that break, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, and later for arguing when the cashier explained their reason.\n\nSo the question is: was the cashier wrong to tell the customer they were on a break instead of answering the question?\n\nLet's consider the rules of the workplace. Usually, employees are expected to be courteous to customers, even during breaks. But sometimes, when an employee is on a scheduled break, they are not supposed to be working. However, the line between being on a break and still being approachable can be blurry. If the cashier was in a common area where customers might approach, maybe they are still expected to assist. But if they were in a designated break area, that's different.\n\nThe cashier mentions they were walking through the store when the customer approached. So they were still in the store but on a break. The manager's instruction was to take a 15-minute break, so the cashier was within their rights to take that break. However, the issue is whether they can refuse to help a customer when they are in the store during their break.\n\nIn many workplaces, even during a break, employees are expected to be helpful if they see a customer in need. But the cashier might be in a situation where they needed to use the bathroom and couldn't afford a long conversation. The customer's question was supposedly simple, but the cashier feared it might lead to a longer conversation based on past experiences.\n\nThe manager's reaction seems harsh, but the company policy probably requires employees to assist customers whenever possible. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom was a valid reason, but perhaps they should have directed the customer to another resource, like a different employee or a sign, instead of cutting them off.\n\nIn terms of union protections, maybe the cashier could have some recourse if the write-up is deemed unfair. But the immediate question is whether the cashier was wrong. They did follow the manager's instruction to take a break but failed to assist the customer, which the manager viewed as rude. The cashier's need to use the bathroom is a valid concern, but maybe they should have handled it differently, like politely directing the customer.\n\nSo, balancing the need to take a break and the expectation to assist customers, the cashier might have been in a tough spot. However, the act of dismissing the customer instead of helping, even while on a break, might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the cashier might be at fault for not assisting the customer, even if they were on a break. However, if the break was a scheduled time away from the floor, then maybe not. The ambiguity here is whether being on a break in the store precludes assisting customers.\n\nIn many retail environments, employees are expected to be helpful even during breaks unless they're in a designated break room. So if the cashier was walking through the store on their break, they might still be expected to help. Therefore, the cashier might be in the wrong for not assisting, but the manager's handling of the situation (writing them up for arguing) could be excessive. However, the initial action of the cashier in not answering a customer might be considered a breach of protocol, making them at least partially at fault.\n\nSo the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't assist the customer, even if they had a valid reason. But maybe B (No) if we consider the manager's harsh response and the probationary period. However, the main question is about the cashier's action towards the customer. Given that the customer asked a straightforward question and the cashier dismissed them, the cashier might be at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
