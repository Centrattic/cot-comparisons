I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the cashier is in the wrong for telling a customer they were on break instead of answering a question. The cashier was on a break as instructed by the manager, but the customer approached them. The cashier was in the middle of their shift and had to go to the bathroom, so they were probably stressed.\n\nFirst, the manager told the cashier to take a break, so being on break is allowed. However, the cashier was in the store, which might still be considered work area. If the customer approached them during a break, the cashier might be expected to help. But maybe the break is supposed to be away from the floor. The store's policy on breaks would matter here. If the break is supposed to be in a break room, then the cashier shouldn't be out there. But if they're allowed to be in the store, maybe they can be approached.\n\nThe customer asked a question, and the cashier said they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier argues that their job is to answer questions but they were on a break. The manager says the customer is always right. The cashier might have a point if they were on break and not supposed to be handling customer service, but maybe they should have directed the customer to someone else or told them they can't help during a break. \n\nHowever, the cashier was in a high-traffic area and might not have been in a break room. The key here is whether the cashier was supposed to be on break and not interacting with customers. If the company's policy states that during breaks, employees shouldn't engage with customers, then the cashier might be in the right. But if the break is flexible and the cashier is still expected to assist, then maybe they're in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the cashier was in a rush to use the bathroom, which adds context. But the manager still wrote them up. The manager's reaction seems strict. However, the cashier didn't handle the situation well by just walking away instead of offering help or apologizing. Maybe a better approach would be to explain they're on break but can help quickly or direct the customer to another cashier. Since the cashier didn't do that, they might have been rude. \n\nSo, considering all that, the cashier might be in the wrong for not handling the customer better even if they were on a break. The manager's policy is clear, and the cashier's response was abrupt. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
