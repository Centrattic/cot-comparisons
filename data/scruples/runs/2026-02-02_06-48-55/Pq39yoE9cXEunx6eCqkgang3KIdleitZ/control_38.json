I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store during their probationary period. They were handling the morning rush alone because a coworker was sick and their manager was late. They took a break as instructed by the manager. While on break, a customer approached and asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier noticed that the product was right behind the customer, so they assumed the customer hadn't looked. They told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager later wrote them up for being rude, even though the cashier was on break and had a valid reason for not engaging further.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the cashier was on a break, the customer's question was simple and the answer was obvious, the cashier was dealing with a long shift without a bathroom break, and the manager's reaction was harsh. The cashier's main argument is that they were on break and didn't want to engage in a potentially lengthy conversation, especially when the answer was readily visible.\n\nNow, considering workplace policies, employees are usually allowed to take breaks as scheduled. If the manager instructed them to take a break, they were following orders. The customer might not have known the cashier was on break, so approaching them is part of the job. However, the cashier's response was to walk away without helping, which could be seen as rude. But the context matters: the cashier was on break, had a valid reason (needing to use the bathroom), and the answer was obvious. \n\nIn many workplaces, even during breaks, if a customer approaches, employees are expected to assist unless they're in a non-public area. However, if the cashier was in a break room or clearly on break, maybe not. But in this case, the cashier was walking through the store, which might still be a public area. The manager's strict adherence to \"customer is always right\" might be overreaching here, especially given the circumstances. The cashier's intention wasn't to be rude but to avoid a long conversation when the answer was easy.\n\nThe manager's decision to write them up for being rude and arguing seems harsh, especially considering the cashier's explanation. The customer's question was straightforward, and the cashier's response was brief and didn't engage in a conflict. The main issue is whether the cashier had the right to decline assistance while on break. If the break was a scheduled break, maybe they should have redirected the customer to someone else. But the cashier might not have been trained to handle that situation, and the manager's handling of the situation was poor.\n\nIn terms of whether the cashier was in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. They were following the manager's order to take a break, but they might have been in a public area where customers expect assistance. However, the context of their long shift and needing to use the bathroom could mitigate the severity. The manager's strict enforcement without considering the circumstances is problematic. So, the cashier might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's some responsibility on their part to handle it more professionally, maybe by directing the customer to another employee if possible. But given the situation, it's a close call. The manager's actions seem more at fault here.\n"
