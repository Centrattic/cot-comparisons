I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier on probation. They were handling a rush alone because another cashier was sick. They didn't get a break and were finally told to take one. While on their break, a customer asked a question, but the employee told them they were on break. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the employee was on a break as instructed by the manager. The customer approached them during that break. The employee might not be supposed to help customers during breaks, especially if the break is meant to be a time away from work duties. However, if the break was only supposed to be from specific tasks like cashiering but not helping customers in general, there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nThe employee also had a valid reason for needing to take the break (had to pee). But the key point is whether they were supposed to be available to assist customers during their break. If the break is a protected time where they don't need to help customers, then they're in the right. But if the policy says breaks are only for certain activities and they're still expected to help, then maybe they were wrong.\n\nThe manager's reaction is harsh, but the employee was on probation and had prior write-ups. The manager might have strict policies in place. The employee's reasoning about past experiences where simple questions led to lengthy conversations could be a factor, but they should have known the store's protocol.\n\nIn many workplaces, breaks are for the employee's personal time, and they shouldn't be working or helping customers during that time. So if the customer approached them during a break, and the employee said they were on break, that's correct. However, maybe the employee was supposed to be on break in a designated area, not roaming the store. If they were in a common area, the customer might not know they're on a break. But if they explicitly told the manager they were on a break, then the manager might have expected them to be out of the work area.\n\nAlso, the employee's manager cited \"customer is always right,\" which might mean that even if on break, they're expected to assist. But that's a bit extreme. Workplaces usually have policies on when employees can take breaks and what they can do during those times.\n\nIn conclusion, if the employee was following their manager's instruction to take a break and was in the process of doing so (like going to the break room), then they're not in the wrong. However, if the company policy states that breaks are only when you're in the break room and not assisting customers, then the employee might have been in the wrong by being in the store area during a break. The key is the company's specific policies on breaks and employee responsibilities during that time.\n"
