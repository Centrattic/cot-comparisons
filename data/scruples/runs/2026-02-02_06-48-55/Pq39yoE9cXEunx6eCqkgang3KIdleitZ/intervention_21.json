I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on a break, but a customer asked for help. The cashier told the customer they were on break instead of answering. The manager gave them a write-up for being rude. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. If the employee was on a break, then they're not supposed to be helping customers. But sometimes, especially in a retail environment, if a customer approaches you even during a break, you might need to assist. However, the author mentions that they were on a break and needed to go to the bathroom, which is a valid need. But the customer asked a question that the answer was obvious, so maybe they felt justified in not engaging. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the answer is obvious, not helping a customer when approached could be seen as rude, regardless of the employee's break status. The manager's stance is that the customer is always right, so the employee might be expected to handle it even during breaks. But the employee was in the middle of their break, so maybe they should have politely declined. The key is whether the employee was supposed to be on break and not working. If they were on a break, they aren't supposed to be working, so maybe the manager's action is unfair. However, the employee was in the store during their break, which might not be against the rules, but assisting a customer then could be considered work.\n\nAnother angle is the probationary period. The employee is on probation and getting written up for this. The manager might be strict about policies. The employee might have thought they were on break and not able to help, but the manager saw it as rudeness. The employee's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is a possible mitigating factor. However, if the policy is that you can't be rude to customers regardless of break time, then the employee is in the wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the employee should have helped even on a break. If the store policy states that you can't be on break and available to customers, but the employee was in the store on a break, perhaps they should have ignored the customer. However, if the policy is that during breaks you should not engage with customers at all, then the employee was correct. But in practice, maybe the employee is expected to be polite but not necessarily help. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the customer was being unreasonable (not looking for the item, asking a simple question), so they had a reason to avoid engaging. But the manager still considered it rude. The employee's need to go to the bathroom adds another layer, but the manager might not care about that. \n\nSo considering all this, the employee might be in the wrong if the company policy states that even on break, they should assist customers if approached. Alternatively, if the break time is supposed to be for personal needs, then the employee was correct. But the manager's reaction seems strict. The answer depends on company policy. Since the user is asking in general, perhaps the employee is in the wrong because not helping a customer when approached, even on a break, is seen as unprofessional. So the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
