I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a cashier at a grocery store, on probation, and they got written up after telling a customer they were on break instead of answering her question. The manager then gave them a write-up for being rude and later for arguing when the author explained themselves.\n\nFirst, the author was handling the morning rush alone because another cashier was sick. They mention they didn't get to go to the bathroom and finally took a break after the manager told them to. While on that break, a customer approached and asked about Cadbury Cream Eggs. The author thought the customer wasn't even looking, as the eggs were right behind them. They told the customer they were on break and walked away.\n\nFrom the manager's perspective, the customer approached the author while they were on the floor, and the author didn't answer the question. The policy might be that employees are supposed to assist customers even during breaks if they're in the store. Or maybe breaks are supposed to be taken in a break room, not on the floor. The manager could see the author as being rude by not helping the customer, even if they were on a break. Since the author is on probation, this might be a stricter situation.\n\nThe author had a reason to take a break because they hadn't gone to the bathroom all morning, but maybe they should have waited until they were in the break room. If they were supposed to stay at their cash register or not be on the floor during breaks, then approaching a customer might be against policy. The author's explanation about needing the bathroom might be valid, but the manager's response was to write them up for arguing, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was on a break, the customer approached them, the author didn't answer, and the manager saw it as rude. The author's probation status adds pressure. The question is whether the author was in the wrong by not helping the customer while on a break.\n\nI think the answer hinges on company policy. If the company expects employees to be available to help customers even during breaks when they're on the floor, then the author was in the wrong. If the break was supposed to be in a designated area, and the author was there to take a break, then they might not be at fault. Since the manager wrote them up, it's likely that according to company policy, being available to customers is required even during breaks. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not assisting the customer despite being on a break. However, the author's need to take a break because of not being able to go to the bathroom could be a mitigating factor. But in terms of workplace policies, the manager's authority and the need to follow procedures would be the priority. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because the manager might have overreacted, but the question is about whether the author was in the wrong according to typical workplace standards.\n"
