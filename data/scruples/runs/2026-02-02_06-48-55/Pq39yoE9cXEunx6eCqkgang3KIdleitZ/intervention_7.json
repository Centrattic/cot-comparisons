I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a cashier who was on a break and didn't answer a customer's question, leading to a write-up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The cashier was handling the morning rush alone because a coworker called in sick. They didn't get a bathroom break and were finally told by their manager to take a 15-minute break. While on that break, a customer approached and asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier saw that the product was right behind the customer but chose to say they were on break instead of helping. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, and the cashier argued, leading to another write-up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the cashier was on a break as instructed, the customer's question was simple and the answer was obvious, and the cashier didn't want to engage in a longer conversation due to prior experiences. However, the manager still considered it rude and wrote them up.\n\nNow, considering company policies. In most retail jobs, employees are expected to assist customers even during breaks unless they're specifically excused. Breaks are for resting, not for avoiding duties. Even if the cashier was on a break, if the manager told them to take a break, maybe it was during a lull, but when a customer approaches, the employee might still need to help. Also, the cashier's reasoning about past experiences with long conversations might be valid, but the correct action would be to politely help regardless.\n\nThe cashier's main argument is that they were on break and needed to use the bathroom. But once on a break, they should be excused from duties. However, the manager might have given the break under the condition that they can still assist if needed. Maybe the manager expected them to help even during the break. Also, the cashier was on probation, so any infraction might be taken more seriously.\n\nThe write-up for arguing might come from the cashier's defense, which could be seen as defying the manager's authority. The manager saying \"the customer is always right\" suggests that customer service is a priority. Even if the customer's question was simple, not helping could be considered rude. The cashier could have politely said they were on a break but still pointed the customer in the right direction.\n\nIn terms of company policy, if the cashier was explicitly told to take a break, maybe they were allowed to not assist. But in many cases, breaks are short and employees are expected to be off the floor, not necessarily ignoring customers. The cashier might have been in the store during their break, so if a customer approaches, they might be expected to help unless they're in a break room.\n\nAlso, the cashier's reasoning about past experiences with customers leading to long conversations is a valid concern, but the correct approach would be to politely assist with a simple question, even if it's brief. The cashier could have responded, \"I'm on a break now, but they're right behind you,\" instead of walking away.\n\nConsidering all this, the cashier might be in the wrong because they didn't help a customer even when the answer was obvious, which could be seen as poor customer service. However, if they were officially on a break and not supposed to be helping, maybe not. But the manager's response suggests that the cashier should have helped regardless. Since the cashier was on probation, their actions might be viewed more critically. The manager's write-up might be harsh, but the cashier did not follow the expected customer service protocol.\n"
