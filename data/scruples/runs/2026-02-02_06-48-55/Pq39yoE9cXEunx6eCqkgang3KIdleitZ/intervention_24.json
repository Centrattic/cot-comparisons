I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the cashier told a customer they were on break instead of answering a question about where Cadbury Cream eggs are. The cashier had been working without a break, had to go to the bathroom, and the manager wrote them up for being rude. The author is asking if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. Typically, employees are expected to be helpful to customers even when they're on break? Wait, but the manager told them to take a break. So if the manager said to take a break, then the cashier was supposed to be off-duty during that time. But maybe the break is supposed to be in a designated area, not walking around the store. If the customer approached them while they were on break, the cashier might not be obligated to help. But maybe the company policy is that even on break, employees should assist customers if they're in the store.\n\nThe cashier was on a probationary period and had a warning about getting fired. The manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing. The customer might have felt ignored or dismissed. Even if the cashier was on a break, the way they responded could be seen as unprofessional. Instead of just walking away, maybe they should have directed the customer to another employee or a self-service option. \n\nAlso, the cashier mentioned that they've had experiences where simple questions turn into long conversations. But if they were on a break, they might not be in a position to engage. However, the customer might not know the employee is on break. The cashier's response could be perceived as rude, hence the manager's action. The manager enforced the policy strictly, which might be part of the company's standards. \n\nSo, even though the cashier had a valid reason to need a break, the way they handled the customer's question might be considered unprofessional. They could have been more polite in declining to help while on break. Therefore, the cashier might be at fault here, making the answer A.\n"
