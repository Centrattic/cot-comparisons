I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store who's on probation and has a union. They were the only cashier during a busy morning rush, didn't get to use the bathroom, and finally took a break when their manager told them to. While on break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which were clearly visible nearby. The user said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the user was on a scheduled break, so they technically shouldn't have been working. However, customer service policies might require employees to assist even during breaks if needed. The user's manager is strict, enforcing the \"customer is always right\" policy strictly. The user's reasoning was that past experiences showed customer questions could lead to longer conversations, and they needed to use the bathroom urgently. But the manager saw it as arguing and being rude.\n\nThe key points here are the store's policies regarding breaks and customer interaction. If the policy states that employees must assist customers even during breaks, then the user was in the wrong. However, if the user was explicitly told they could take a break and the manager later contradicted that by expecting them to help, there's a problem with management's consistency. Also, the user's probationary period and previous write-up add pressure, but the situation's context (urgency to use the bathroom) might mitigate their responsibility.\n\nIn many workplaces, especially retail, employees are expected to be available to customers unless they're on a break. If the user was on a break, they shouldn't have been assisting customers. However, if the manager allowed them to take the break after the rush, maybe expecting them to still help during the break is unfair. The user's response of stating they were on break is technically correct, but the manager's reaction might be overly harsh. The user's urgency to use the bathroom could be a valid reason to not engage, but the manager's policy doesn't account for that.\n\nConsidering the balance, the user might not be entirely in the wrong if the policy allows breaks and they were following the manager's instruction. However, the manager's policy is strict, so maybe the user should have handled the situation differently, like politely declining assistance while on break. The answer hinges on specific company policies, but given the information, the user's primary mistake was not adhering to the policy of assisting customers even during a break if needed. Hence, the answer might be A, but there's ambiguity.\n"
