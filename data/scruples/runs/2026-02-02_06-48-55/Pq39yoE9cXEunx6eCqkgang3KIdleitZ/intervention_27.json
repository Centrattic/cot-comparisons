I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a cashier who was on a break and told a customer they couldn't help with a question because they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude, and now the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The cashier was handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, then when on break, a customer asked a question. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier argues that they needed to take a break and didn't want a long conversation, especially since they had to use the bathroom.\n\nSo, what's the company policy on breaks? If the manager told them to take a 15-minute break, then the cashier was supposed to be on break. But if the policy is that employees should be available to customers even during breaks unless in a break room, maybe the cashier was in the wrong. However, in some stores, breaks are supposed to be away from the floor to prevent that exact situation\u2014employees being distracted by customers.\n\nThe customer asked a question, and the cashier didn't try to help. Even if on break, maybe they should have at least pointed the customer in the right direction. The story mentions that the product was obvious nearby, so maybe the cashier could have said, \"They're right behind you\" and then continued their break. Instead, the cashier walked away without giving any information.\n\nBut the cashier's reason was that they needed to take a break and use the bathroom. If the company policy allows for breaks and expects employees to take them without being interrupted, then the customer's question shouldn't have been a problem. However, the cashier's response might have come off as rude. Telling someone they're on a break without offering help could be seen as unprofessional. The cashier could have been more polite and still given the answer.\n\nThe manager wrote them up for being rude and then for arguing. The cashier's response to the manager was defensive. Even if they felt justified, arguing with a manager when being written up can escalate the situation. The manager's perspective is that the customer's right comes first, so the cashier's refusal to help\u2014even if on break\u2014was unprofessional.\n\nSo, considering all that, the cashier probably should have handled the customer's question politely even while on break. The manager's policy might require employees to be helpful regardless of their break status. The cashier's action of walking away without any assistance could be seen as rude. Therefore, the cashier might be in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
