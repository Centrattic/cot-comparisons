I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They had a busy morning rush, handled it alone, didn't get to use the bathroom. Their manager told them to take a break. When taking the break, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The author told the customer they were on break and walked away. Then the manager wrote them up for being rude and for arguing when they explained.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the workplace rules, the probationary period, and the specific policy about customers. The author was told to take a break, but maybe even during a break, they're supposed to be available for customer help? Or is a break supposed to be a time when they're off duties? Also, the manager's reaction seems strict\u2014writing up for not answering a customer question and then for arguing.\n\nIn most workplaces, especially retail, there might be policies that employees are expected to be available to assist customers even during breaks? Or maybe breaks are supposed to be taken in a way that allows the employee to step away but not necessarily be unreachable. But the author was on a break, so maybe their manager allowed them to step away. However, the author's action of walking away from a customer could be seen as not fulfilling their duty, depending on company policy.\n\nThe author's defense is that they had to use the bathroom and didn't want another long interaction, which they've had before. But the manager's response was to write them up, which might be too harsh if the employee was actually on a break. But maybe the policy says that even during breaks, employees should be available to help. That's a bit conflicting because breaks are supposed to be a time to rest.\n\nThe customer might have felt ignored, and the manager's policy of \"customer is always right\" could be taken to mean that the employee has to respond, regardless of their own needs. But the employee is human and has bathroom needs. However, the author's response was to say they were on break and walk away. If the manager considers that rude, maybe the correct approach would be to direct the customer to a help desk or another employee instead of just leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was explicitly told to take a break by the manager, maybe they were supposed to be off duty, so helping the customer wasn't necessary. However, the manager might expect that even during breaks, employees assist if needed. It's a bit ambiguous without knowing the exact company policy.\n\nThe author was written up for not answering and then again for arguing. The manager's actions seem strict, but the employee's actions might be seen as not following protocol. If the employee was supposed to help regardless of being on a break, then they were in the wrong. If breaks are a time to be unavailable, then the manager was too harsh.\n\nIn terms of the probationary period, the manager's strictness might be part of the evaluation. The author's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is understandable, but maybe they should have handled it differently, like politely explaining their break and offering to help after the break or directing the customer to another resource.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might have made a mistake in how they handled the situation, but maybe the manager's response was also too harsh. However, in terms of company policy, if the employee was supposed to be available to assist customers even during a break, then the author was in the wrong. If not, then the manager was wrong to write them up. But the author admitted to walking away without helping, which could be a breach of policy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
