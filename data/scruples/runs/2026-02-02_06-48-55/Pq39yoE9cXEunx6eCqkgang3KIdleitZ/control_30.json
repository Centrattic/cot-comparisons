I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a cashier who was on break but got written up for not helping a customer.\n\nFirst, the cashier was handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and then was told to take a break. But when a customer approached, the cashier said they were on break. The manager wrote them up for not helping the customer.\n\nSo, the cashier's main argument is that they needed to use the bathroom and were on break when the customer approached. The manager insisted on following the \"customer is always right\" policy, but the cashier felt justified in taking their break after being overworked.\n\nNow, considering the rules: employees are supposed to take their breaks, but also need to be available for customers. If the cashier was officially on a break when the customer approached, then maybe they were in the right. However, sometimes breaks are supposed to be taken during less busy times, and maybe the cashier should have handled the situation differently.\n\nBut the context shows that the cashier was told to take the break specifically by the manager after a long shift. The manager then punished them for not helping during the break. That seems contradictory. The manager told the cashier to take a break but then penalized them for not working during that time. That might be an issue with management's handling of the situation.\n\nAlso, the cashier was in a probationary period and got written up again, which could lead to termination. The user is worried about losing the job. If the manager is enforcing policies inconsistently, the cashier might not be at fault. The key points are whether the cashier was actually on a break when the customer approached and if the manager's instructions were clear.\n\nIf the cashier was allowed to take the break and the customer interrupted them, then the cashier was following the manager's advice. But if the cashier was supposed to be on the floor even during breaks, that's a problem. The answer hinges on whether the cashier was correctly on break when they told the customer they were on break. If so, then the cashier isn't in the wrong. If they were supposed to be available, then maybe they were. But given the manager's role in telling them to take the break, it's possible the manager is at fault here. So, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
