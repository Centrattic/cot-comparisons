I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier, who's on probation, was on a break when a customer asked a question. The cashier told the customer they were on break instead of answering, and then got written up for being rude. The manager also wrote them up for arguing when they tried to explain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. Typically, when an employee is on a break, especially a mandated one, they should not be approached for work-related tasks. However, the customer was asking a simple question, not a complex one. The cashier's job might involve helping customers, so even on break, if approached, they might be expected to assist unless told otherwise by management.\n\nBut wait, the manager had told the cashier to take a 15-minute break, implying that they were allowed to step away from their duties. If the break is a protected time, then the cashier isn't obligated to help. However, in some workplaces, especially retail, employees might be expected to be available even during breaks if customers approach, depending on company policy.\n\nThe cashier's reason for needing to take a break was to go to the bathroom, which is a basic need. They had been working without a break due to understaffing, which is a common issue in retail. The manager's response seems harsh, but the problem is whether the cashier violated a rule by not helping the customer while on break.\n\nAnother angle is the manager's handling of the situation. If the cashier was on a break given by the manager, the manager might be at fault for not ensuring they could take the break without interference. However, the cashier might still have a responsibility to inform the customer politely that they can't help at the moment, rather than just walking away, which could be perceived as rude.\n\nThe key points are: Was the cashier allowed to be on a break? Yes, as per the manager's instruction. Did the customer approach during a break? Yes. Should the cashier have helped despite being on break? It depends on company policy. If the company expects employees to assist customers even on breaks, then the cashier might be in the wrong. But if the break was a protected time, then the cashier isn't at fault. Additionally, the cashier's need to use the bathroom is valid, but that doesn't excuse rudeness. The cashier could have been more polite in deflecting the customer's question.\n\nSo, considering all this, the cashier might be in the wrong for not being polite when refusing to help, even if they were on break. The manager might have a point about the customer service aspect. However, the manager's immediate write-up without considering the cashier's situation also raises questions about management style. But the question is specifically about whether the cashier was in the wrong, not the manager. The cashier's explanation about needing a break is valid, but the manner in which they handled the customer's question might not have been appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they could have handled the situation better, but there's also a case for B (Not in the wrong) if the break was protected. However, given the \"customer is always right\" policy, the cashier might be at fault.\n"
