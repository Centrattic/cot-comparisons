I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store who's on probation. They were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a chance to use the bathroom, and eventually took a break as instructed by their manager. Then a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which the cashier answered by saying they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude, and now the cashier is worried about getting fired.\n\nFirst, the cashier was on a break. If the manager told them to take a 15-minute break, then technically they were supposed to be off their floor duties during that time. However, the context is that the cashier was in the store, possibly still in the vicinity where customers might approach. But if the break is meant to be away from work duties, then maybe the cashier shouldn't have been engaging with customers during that time.\n\nThe customer's question: the cashier mentions that the product was clearly visible right behind them. So maybe the customer wasn't actually looking and just wanted to engage. But the cashier, who was in the middle of needing to go to the bathroom, didn't want to get into a long conversation. They told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager saw this as rude. \n\nWorkplace rules often prioritize customer service, so even if you're on break, employees might be expected to assist if a customer approaches. But if the break is a scheduled break, maybe the employee isn't supposed to be working during that time. The manager's reaction seems harsh because the cashier was following instructions to take a break. However, the cashier might have been in the wrong by being on break in the store area where they could be seen, leading to customer interaction.\n\nThe cashier's need to use the bathroom is a valid concern. Employers are supposed to allow reasonable breaks. But if the manager told them to take a break, maybe the timing was off. Also, explaining the situation to the manager might not have been done effectively. The cashier said they were on break, but the manager might have expected them to still be available for assistance during their break.\n\nIn terms of the write-up, the manager claims the customer is always right. But the cashier's response was to state they were on break. If the policy is that employees can't decline customer interactions even during breaks, then the cashier was wrong. However, if the break is a protected time away from work duties, then the manager's write-up might be unfair. \n\nThe cashier is on probation, which means they have a shorter leash. But the situation seems like it could have been handled better by the manager. Maybe the cashier didn't realize that even during breaks, they might still need to assist. Alternatively, the manager should have considered the context of the cashier's need for a break after a long shift without bathroom access.\n\nSo, considering all this, the cashier might have a valid reason for being on a break and needing to go to the bathroom. However, the way they handled the customer's question (cutting off and walking away) could be seen as rude. Maybe a better approach would have been to politely state they were on a break and point the customer to the product. But since the product was clearly visible, the cashier might have been within their rights to not engage further. \n\nThe manager's write-up seems a bit heavy-handed, but if company policy strictly enforces customer service even during breaks, the cashier could be in the wrong. However, if the break was intended to give the employee time off from duties, then the manager's actions are unfair. It's a bit of a gray area. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is a valid reason, but the way they communicated it to the manager (arguing instead of just following the write-up) might have made it worse. \n\nOverall, the cashier might not be entirely in the wrong because they were following the manager's instruction to take a break and had a legitimate need. However, the way they handled the customer interaction could have been improved, leading to the write-up. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the cashier not being in the wrong because the manager's expectations might have been unclear or overly strict.\n"
