I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the cashier told a customer they were on break instead of helping them find something. The cashier was supposed to be on break but had to handle the morning rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, and the manager told them to take a break. When the customer approached, the cashier was in a hurry and said they were on break. Then the manager wrote them up for being rude and arguing when they tried to explain.\n\nFirst, the rules of the job probably say that when on break, employees shouldn't be helping customers. But in a grocery store, cashiers might be expected to assist even when not at their register. The manager told the cashier to take a break, so technically they should be on break. However, the cashier might have been in a rush to use the bathroom, so they snapped at the customer.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier was given the break by the manager, so they might be within their rights to not help. But in practice, customer service roles often require flexibility. The cashier might have been in a tough spot, but refusing to help a customer, even while on break, could be seen as unprofessional. The manager's job is to enforce policies, so if the policy says you can't help customers on break, then the cashier is wrong. If the policy is more lenient, maybe not.\n\nBut the cashier's reasoning is that they needed to go to the bathroom and didn't want a long conversation. However, the way they responded (\"I was sorry I was on break and walked away\") could be perceived as rude. The manager's reaction is to write them up for being rude and then for arguing. The cashier might have been stressed and in a hurry, but the response to the customer wasn't appropriate. So, maybe the cashier is at fault for not handling the situation better, even if they were on break. But the manager might have failed to communicate the expectations clearly. \n\nAlternatively, the cashier was following the manager's order to take a break, so they should be excused. But in a customer-facing job, even on break, employees might be expected to assist if it's quick. The key is whether the cashier was actually on a break when they should be available for customer assistance. If the manager told them to take a break, then they are off duty and not supposed to help. But the manager might expect employees to be available unless on an official break.\n\nSo, the cashier might be in the wrong if the policy states that during breaks, employees should not engage with customers. However, if the manager's instruction to take a break was meant to let them rest, then the cashier is right. The manager's write-up might be too harsh if the cashier was following orders. But the cashier's tone and action could have been perceived as rude regardless. The answer might be a mix, but according to the rules, the cashier might be in the wrong for not handling the customer properly, even if they were on break.\n"
