I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling the morning rush alone, couldn't go to the bathroom, and finally got a break. When a customer approached, the employee was on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude, even though the employee was on a break.\n\nFirst, the key points: The employee was on a break, as instructed by the manager. The customer approached them while they were on break. The employee didn't answer the question and left. The manager considered this rude and wrote them up.\n\nNow, considering company policies. Typically, when an employee is on a break, they're not supposed to be working or assisting customers. But sometimes, especially in a retail setting, employees might be expected to help even during breaks if they're in the store. However, the manager had just told the employee to take a break, so maybe they were supposed to be off the floor. But the employee was in the store area, so maybe that's part of the issue.\n\nThe employee's reasoning: they needed to use the bathroom and didn't want to get into a long conversation, which they've had before. The customer didn't look like they had looked, so the employee assumed they weren't serious. But the problem here is that the employee was on break. If the company allows employees to take breaks and be off the floor, then the employee wasn't supposed to be helping. However, if they were still in the store and customers might not know they're on break, the employee might be expected to still assist, even if it's against their own needs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and the employee was being rude by not helping. The employee's side is that they were on a break and had valid reasons (needing bathroom, long hours). \n\nBut according to employment rules, if the employee was on an unpaid break and was allowed to step away from their station, then they aren't in the wrong. However, if the company expects employees to be available to help even on breaks, then maybe the employee did wrong. However, the manager had told them to take a break, implying they could step away. The manager later wrote them up for being on break, which might be a conflict in the company's policy.\n\nAlso, the employee was on probation and had a previous write-up. This might make the manager more strict. But the core issue is whether being on a break and refusing to help a customer is against company policy. If the policy states that employees must assist customers even during breaks, then the employee is in the wrong. If the break is a time to step away, then the manager is wrong to write them up.\n\nGiven that the manager's response was to write them up for being on a break, and the employee was following the manager's instruction to take a break, it's possible the employee isn't in the wrong. The manager's reaction might be inconsistent with the initial instruction. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
