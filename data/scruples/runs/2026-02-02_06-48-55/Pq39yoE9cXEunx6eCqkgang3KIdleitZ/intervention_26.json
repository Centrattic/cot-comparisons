I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the cashier told a customer they were on break instead of helping them find Cadbury Cream Eggs. The person is worried about getting fired because they're on probation and have a write-up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. When an employee is on a break, they're supposed to step away from their duties. The manager told the cashier to take a break, so technically, the cashier was in their break time. However, being on a break usually means you're not supposed to be helping customers during that time. So walking away might be appropriate if they're actually on break.\n\nBut then, the manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier tried to explain they were on a break and needed to go to the bathroom. The manager didn't accept that and saw it as arguing. The key points here are the workplace policies regarding breaks and customer service. If the policy is that employees can't engage with customers during breaks, then the cashier was following the rules. However, if the policy is that employees should still assist customers even during breaks, then the cashier is in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's perspective. The customer approached the cashier, expecting help. The cashier was on a break, but maybe the customer didn't realize that. If the cashier was in a visible area, the customer might not know they were on break. So pointing out that they were on break but still helping could be seen as the right thing to do, even if it's not required. But if the cashier was in a break room, then walking away makes sense.\n\nThe cashier's reason for being on a break was because they were overworked and hadn't taken one. The manager's responsibility is to ensure employees take their breaks. If the cashier was on a break as instructed, then the manager's fault is not managing the workload properly. However, the cashier's action of telling the customer they were on break might not be the best approach. Maybe they should have politely explained they were on break but could direct the customer or suggest they ask another employee. But since the cashier was in a different part of the store, maybe there wasn't another cashier available. \n\nThe manager's response seems harsh. Writing up for being on a break and arguing when explaining the situation could indicate poor management. However, the cashier did mention they were on a break, which is a valid reason. The conflict arises from the manager's strict adherence to the \"customer is always right\" policy without considering the employee's circumstances. \n\nIn terms of employment policies, if breaks are mandatory, then the cashier was following the rules. The manager's write-up might be unjust in this case. However, the cashier's communication could have been better. Instead of just saying they were on break, maybe offering some assistance would have been better. But the main issue is the manager's handling of the situation and the workload management.\n\nSo, considering all this, the cashier might not be entirely in the wrong. They were following the break policy and had valid reasons for needing to take a break. The manager failed to manage the workload and handle the situation properly. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, there's a possibility that the cashier could have handled the interaction better, but the main fault lies with the manager. So the cashier isn't the asshole here.\n"
