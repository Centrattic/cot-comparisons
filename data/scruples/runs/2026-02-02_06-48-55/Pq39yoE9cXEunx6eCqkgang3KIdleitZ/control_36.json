I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, they're a cashier at a grocery store, on probation, and they got written up for telling a customer they were on break. The situation is that they were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get to go to the bathroom, and finally got a break. While on break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream Eggs were. The employee said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules at their job. If the manager said to take a break, then they were technically on break. But maybe there are policies about being available to customers even during breaks? Or maybe breaks are supposed to be in a specific area, so if they were on the floor, they might be expected to assist customers. However, the employee felt they needed to use the bathroom and didn't want to get into a long conversation because of past experiences where customers asked multiple questions.\n\nThe customer's question was about a product that was right behind them, which might have been an easy answer. But the employee was on a break, which is their time to rest, especially after a long shift without bathroom breaks. The manager wrote them up for not helping and for arguing when they explained their situation.\n\nProbationary periods usually have stricter rules, but the employee did follow the manager's instruction to take a break. The manager might have expected employees to still assist customers during breaks if they're on the floor. However, the employee's need to use the bathroom is a basic human necessity. \n\nThere's a balance between job responsibilities and employee rights. If the manager allowed them to take a break, then they should be able to use that time without being interrupted for customer service. But maybe the store's policy is that breaks are in a designated area, and being on the floor during a break isn't allowed. The employee might have been in a common area when the customer approached them, making it unclear if they were supposed to be available.\n\nThe key points are: the employee was on a break as instructed, the customer's question could be answered quickly, and the manager's response was to write them up for both refusing the question and explaining their situation. The employee felt they were in a difficult spot between following the manager's break instruction and the customer's request. \n\nIn many workplaces, especially retail, there's an expectation that employees on break should not be interrupted unless it's urgent. However, if the employee was on break but still on the premises, customers might not know that and expect help. The manager's strict adherence to \"customer is always right\" could be causing issues here. The employee's actions were to prioritize their personal needs, which are important, especially after a long shift without bathroom breaks. \n\nSo, considering all that, the employee might not be entirely in the wrong. They followed the manager's instruction to take a break and had a legitimate need to use the bathroom. The manager's response seems harsh, especially writing up for explaining their situation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (Not the Asshole).\n"
