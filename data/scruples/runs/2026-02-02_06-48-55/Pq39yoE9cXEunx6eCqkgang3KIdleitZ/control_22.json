I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on break and a customer asked a question. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. If the employee was on a break, then they're not supposed to be helping customers during that time. But maybe there's a policy about being available to assist even during breaks, or maybe not. The manager might have expected them to help regardless of being on break.\n\nThe cashier mentions that they had to use the bathroom and didn't want to engage in a long conversation. But the customer just asked where a product was, which is a simple question. The cashier's answer was to say they were on break. Did they need to help even if it's not their shift to be at the register? Maybe the manager's policy is that employees should be available to help customers when on the premises, even during breaks.\n\nAlso, the cashier was on a probationary period and had a prior write-up. This might mean that their actions were more scrutinized. The manager might have a strict policy about customer service, leading to the write-up for not assisting.\n\nAnother angle: the cashier was overwhelmed with the morning rush, didn't get a bathroom break, and was finally given one. The manager told them to take a break. If the break means they're not supposed to work, then the cashier was following instructions. But if the break allows for being interrupted by customers, then maybe the cashier was wrong.\n\nThe key point is whether the employee was supposed to be available to help customers during their scheduled break. If the manager's instruction was to take a 15-minute break, then the employee might be within their rights to not engage with customers. However, stores often expect employees to be helpful at all times unless they're off the clock.\n\nAdditionally, the cashier's reasoning about past experiences where simple questions led to lengthy conversations might have influenced their decision. But the customer's question here was straightforward, so the cashier could have pointed them to the obvious location quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a judgment call. If the store's policy is that employees must assist customers even during breaks, then the cashier is in the wrong. If the break time is protected and the manager instructed them to take it, then the cashier is not in the wrong. Since the manager wrote them up, it seems the policy is that helping customers takes precedence.\n"
