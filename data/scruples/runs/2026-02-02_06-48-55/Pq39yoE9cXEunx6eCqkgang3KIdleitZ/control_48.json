I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they were a cashier on a break, got asked a question by a customer, and then told the customer they were on break instead of answering. Then the manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The employee was handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a break, and finally got a 15-minute break. While on break, a customer asked a question. The employee was stressed from not using the bathroom and didn't want to engage in a long conversation, so they said they were on break. The manager saw this as being rude and wrote them up. The employee is worried about probation and potential firing.\n\nNow, considering workplace policies. Employees are usually expected to be on task during work hours. If the manager told them to take a break, then during that break time, maybe they aren't supposed to be assisting customers? Or is taking a break not a valid excuse to not help a customer? Some stores might have policies that employees should be available even during breaks, especially if the break is for a short duration. Also, the employee was on probation, which might mean stricter adherence to rules.\n\nThe employee's reasoning is that they were stressed and needed to use the bathroom. But the manager insisted on the \"customer is always right\" policy. The employee also mentioned that they weren't arguing, just explaining their situation. However, the manager perceived their response as rude. \n\nIn retail, customer service is crucial. Even during breaks, employees might be expected to be approachable. If the employee was on a break, maybe they should have directed the customer to another cashier or a different resource instead of just walking away. However, the employee was told by the manager to take the break, so maybe they were allowed to be off-duty during that time.\n\nAnother point is the customer's actions. The employee thought the customer wasn't looking, which might imply the customer was being inconsiderate. But the employee's response of saying they were on break could still be seen as unhelpful.\n\nSo, there's a conflict between employee well-being and customer service expectations. The employee had valid reasons for needing a break and being uncomfortable, but the manager's policy prioritizes customer interaction over that. \n\nIn terms of workplace policies, if the employee was given a break, they might not be expected to help customers during that time. However, if the break is supposed to be a time when they're still on duty (like a \"stepping away\" break), then the employee might be in the wrong for not assisting. \n\nAlso, the manager wrote them up for arguing, which adds another layer. The employee's explanation could be seen as a defense, but the manager perceived it as an argument. \n\nIn many workplaces, communication is key. The employee could have politely directed the customer to another resource while on break. But given the stress and need for a bathroom break, maybe the employee's action was understandable, but against company policy.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The employee might not be entirely wrong, but they did violate company policy by not helping a customer during their break. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the manager enforces the policy strictly, and the employee's action, while understandable, didn't follow the expected customer service protocol.\n"
