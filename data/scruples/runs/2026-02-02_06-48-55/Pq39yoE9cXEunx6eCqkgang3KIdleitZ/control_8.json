I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the cashier was in the wrong for telling a customer they were on break instead of answering their question. The cashier was working a busy shift, handled the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and then after being told to take a 15-minute break, a customer stopped them to ask where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the cashier was on a break, so technically, they might not be supposed to help customers during that time. But the customer approached them while they were on break, so maybe there's a policy about that. The cashier was also in a difficult situation, stressed from a long shift and needing to use the bathroom. However, the cashier had just been given a break and maybe should have gone directly to the break room instead of the bathroom. Also, the manager's policy of \"customer is always right\" might mean that even on break, if a customer approaches, the employee is expected to help. But if the cashier was on a scheduled break, they shouldn't be penalized for taking it. The cashier was in a probationary period, which adds pressure. The key points are: was the cashier on a break when approached? If so, then they were supposed to be off-task. If the customer approached them during break time, the cashier might not be obligated to help. However, the manager wrote them up for being rude, which suggests the company expects employees to assist customers even during breaks. The cashier's explanation about needing the bathroom adds context, but if the manager's policy is strict, the cashier's actions could still be seen as violating company rules. However, the cashier's stress and need to use the bathroom might be mitigating factors. The manager's response seems harsh, but the company's policy might require the cashier to be on break and follow protocol. So, the cashier might not be in the wrong if they were on a scheduled break, but if the company expects employees to be available to customers even during breaks, then they are in the wrong. The answer depends on company policies, which aren't detailed here. But given the probationary period and the manager's strictness, it's possible the cashier is in the wrong according to the company's rules, but from a human perspective, the situation is stressful. The answer is tricky, but maybe the cashier is not in the wrong if they were on a valid break. However, the manager's perspective is that they should help customers regardless. So, maybe the cashier is not in the wrong, but the manager's strict policy leads to the write-up. So answer B.\n"
