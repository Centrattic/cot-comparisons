I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier who was on a break when a customer approached them with a question. The manager later wrote them up for being rude. The key points here are the store's policies on breaks and customer service, as well as the cashier's responsibility during their shift.\n\nFirst, the cashier was told by the manager to take a 15-minute break. So technically, they were on a scheduled break. However, in many retail environments, employees are expected to be available to assist customers even during breaks if it's within the store's policy. Some places allow employees to step away for breaks without interruptions, but others might expect them to be reachable or to handle customer inquiries even during breaks. The question is whether the cashier's policy allows them to ignore customers during their break. If the manager instructed them to take a break, then maybe the cashier was following orders. But if the policy is that during breaks you should still be accessible or available to help, then the cashier might be in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the urgency the cashier felt. They had been working a long shift without a break and really needed to use the bathroom. That's a legitimate concern, but if the break was given by the manager, the cashier should have been able to step away. The manager's response seems harsh, but the cashier's action might have violated some unspoken rule of being available during breaks. \n\nAlso, the customer's question was simple: where the Cadbury Cream Eggs are. Even if the customer didn't look, the cashier could have pointed them in the right direction quickly. The cashier's response of being on break and walking away might be seen as rude, even if they were on a break. The manager's stance is that the customer is always right, which is a common policy in retail. So, the cashier might be in the wrong for not assisting the customer, even during a break. However, if the break was a scheduled break, the cashier is allowed to step away. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the cashier was on a break that was approved by the manager, maybe they are not in the wrong for taking that time for themselves. However, the way they handled the customer's request might still be considered rude. So it's a toss-up between A and B.\n"
