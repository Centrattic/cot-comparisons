I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store, on probation, and they got written up for being rude to a customer. The customer asked where Cadbury Cream Eggs were, which the author thought were obvious in the aisle behind them. The author says they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing when the author tried to explain their side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. The author was told to take a break, so maybe they were allowed to be on break. But in many places, being on break doesn't mean you can ignore customers. Cashiers are usually expected to be helping customers even during breaks if needed. But maybe the store has specific policies about where breaks should be taken and when you can be approached by customers.\n\nThe customer approached the author on the floor, so maybe the author was supposed to be assisting customers even during a break if they're on the premises. The author mentions that previous interactions have turned into long conversations, so they were trying to avoid that because they needed to use the bathroom. But the manager's response was strict, saying the customer is always right and that the author was rude. \n\nThe author's defense is that they were on break and in a hurry to use the bathroom. However, if they were supposed to be working while on break (like if breaks are only allowed in the break room), then walking away might be acceptable. But if they were still in a public area and customers expect help, maybe not. \n\nAlso, the manager's reaction seems harsh. Giving a write-up for being rude and then another for arguing might be excessive. The author wasn't arguing but explaining. The manager's approach might be part of the issue here. \n\nWorkplace policies would be key here. If the author's break didn't restrict them from assisting customers, then walking away could be considered rude. However, if the break was meant to be a time to step away, then maybe it's understandable. Probation periods are strict, so any perceived misstep can lead to consequences. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they were overworked, handled the morning rush alone, and needed to use the bathroom. But the way they handled the interaction might not have been the best. Instead of walking away, maybe they could have politely said they were on break but could point the customer in the right direction. That would have been proactive and helpful without engaging in a conversation. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not assisting the customer even during their break, but the manager's handling of the situation also seems problematic. However, the question is about the author specifically. If the company's policy is that employees must be available to help customers even during breaks unless they're in the break room, then the author did wrong. If the break allows them to be away from work duties, then maybe not. \n\nSince the author was told to take a break, maybe they were allowed to be away from their register and not assist customers. But if they were still in the store area where they're expected to be helpful, then it's a problem. The customer's question was simple, and the author could have given a quick answer instead of leaving. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not assisting the customer, even if briefly, but the manager's handling of the write-ups is questionable. However, based on the scenario, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault due to not following customer service expectations.\n"
