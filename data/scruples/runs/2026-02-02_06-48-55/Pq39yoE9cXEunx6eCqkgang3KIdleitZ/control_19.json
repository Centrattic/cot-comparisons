I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on break and a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier told her they were on break instead of answering. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The user wants to know if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The cashier was handling the morning rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, and finally got a break. Then a customer approached. The cashier decided to walk away instead of answering the question. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFrom the cashier's perspective, they were on break, had a legitimate reason to be on break (manager told them to take it), and might have been avoiding a long conversation because they were in a hurry. They mention that in the past, simple questions turned into long interactions. They were also stressed about needing to use the bathroom.\n\nThe manager's side is that the customer is always right, and the cashier was rude by not helping. The cashier argued, but the manager interpreted it as arguing. The cashier is on probation and getting written up could lead to termination.\n\nNow, considering company policies. Most places expect employees to be helpful even on breaks, unless the break is a scheduled one. If the cashier was on a break that the manager had approved, then maybe they weren't supposed to be helping customers. But if the break is during their shift and they're supposed to be available, then walking away might be against policy.\n\nThe cashier might have thought they were allowed to take the break without interruptions. However, in a retail setting, breaks are usually for rest and not for avoiding responsibilities. The customer's question is straightforward, and not answering could be seen as poor service. But the cashier's situation was difficult\u2014handling a rush without a break, then being told to take one but needing to use the bathroom.\n\nAlso, the manager's response seems harsh. Writing someone up for a first offense, especially when they explain their situation, might be excessive. However, the manager's stance on \"customer is always right\" is a company policy that the cashier might be expected to follow regardless of personal circumstances.\n\nThe cashier's actions could be seen as not following protocol. Even if they were on a break, they might be expected to assist if the manager hadn't specified that breaks are not to be interrupted. The cashier might have been in the wrong by not helping the customer, leading to a write-up. However, the manager's handling of the situation and the cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom might mitigate some of the blame.\n\nIn conclusion, the cashier might be at fault for not helping the customer during their break, but the manager's strict enforcement without considering the context could also be problematic. However, based on typical workplace policies, the cashier is expected to assist customers unless they are in a designated break area. Since the cashier was on the floor, it's possible they were still expected to be available. So, the answer might lean towards the cashier being in the wrong (A), but there are mitigating factors. However, the manager's strictness might also be an issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The cashier's action of not helping the customer was against company policy, even if their reasons were understandable. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
