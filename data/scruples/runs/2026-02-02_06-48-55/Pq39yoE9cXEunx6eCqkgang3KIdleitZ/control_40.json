I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier who's on probation and just got written up. The situation is they were told to take a break but were asked a question by a customer, then told the customer they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the employee was handling the morning rush alone, couldn't use the bathroom, and was finally told to take a break. When the customer approached, they were on break, and the employee told them that. But the manager still wrote them up. \n\nThe key points here are the rules of the job. If the employee was explicitly told to take a break, then they are supposed to be on break. But maybe there's a policy that employees should still assist customers even during breaks? Or maybe not. \n\nThe employee's defense is that they were on break and needed to go to the bathroom. But if the manager told them to take a break, maybe they should have directed the customer to another staff member or used a different approach. However, the customer was right there and the employee was the only one available. Maybe the customer didn't look like they were being ignored because of the Easter decorations. \n\nThe manager's reaction seems harsh, but the employee's explanation might not have been clear. The employee might have been in the store during their break, which is allowed, but when approached, they were supposed to be on break. If the company policy is that employees must be available to help customers even during breaks unless they're in a break room, then the employee is in the wrong. But if the employee was in a public area during their break and not working, then maybe they're not at fault. \n\nAlso, the employee's history of getting into long conversations might explain their hesitation, but if they were on break, they shouldn't have been expected to help. The manager's decision to write them up for being rude might be based on the customer's perspective. The employee's excuse about needing the bathroom might not matter if they were told to take a break and chose to be in a public area.\n\nIn terms of union rules, maybe there's some leeway, but the manager's authority might override that. The main issue is whether the employee was supposed to assist customers during their break. If the answer is yes, then the employee is wrong. If not, then maybe not. The manager's harshness might be a separate issue, but the employee's action could still be against company policy. So maybe AITA? The employee might be at fault for not handling the customer correctly during their break, hence answer A. But if the company policy allows breaks in common areas without assistance, then B. But the problem is the employee was told to take a break, but maybe they shouldn't be in the store during the break. If breaks are supposed to be in the break room, then the employee was in the wrong place. But if they were allowed to take a break in the store, then maybe not. The manager's reaction seems strict, but the employee's actions might violate policy. So possibly A.\n"
