I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for telling a customer they were on break instead of answering a question.\n\nFirst, the context: The cashier was handling a busy morning alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, and was finally told to take a break by their manager. During that break, a customer approached to ask about Cadbury Cream eggs. The cashier says they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, and another write-up for arguing when explaining their situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the cashier was on a scheduled break, the customer was right behind them where the product was, and the cashier felt they had a legitimate reason to not engage. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right and the cashier was disrespectful by not helping.\n\nFrom the employee's side, they were following the manager's instruction to take a break after a long shift. They had a physical need (to use the bathroom) which was urgent. The customer's question seems answerable by looking at the product location nearby, so maybe the cashier didn't have to engage. However, the cashier's response might have come off as dismissive or rude, even if they were on break. In many jobs, especially retail, you're supposed to be available to help customers unless you're on a break. If the cashier explicitly said they were on break, maybe they followed protocol correctly. But the manager might have rules about not being approachable even during breaks, or perhaps the cashier was supposed to be on break in a designated area, not roaming the floor. \n\nThe manager's reaction seems harsh, but as the authority figure, their rules might be clear in the employee handbook. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is a valid concern, but if they were on a break, maybe they should have gone to the break room instead of wandering the store. The customer might have felt ignored, leading to the write-up. \n\nSo, is the cashier in the wrong? It depends on the store's policies. If breaks are allowed and the cashier was following the manager's instruction, then maybe not. However, if the policy is that employees should be available to customers even during breaks, then yes. Since the manager is enforcing \"customer is always right,\" the cashier's refusal to help could be seen as against that policy. But the cashier's justification is their physical discomfort and following a manager's order to take a break. \n\nOn balance, it's a nuanced situation. The cashier might have a valid reason, but from the manager's standpoint, the customer's experience is paramount. The cashier's actions could be seen as neglecting customer service duties, even if they were on a break. However, if the break was properly scheduled, they might not be at fault. Given that the manager wrote them up, the company's policy likely expects employees to be available during their shifts unless explicitly off. So the cashier might be in the wrong for not adhering to that policy.\n"
