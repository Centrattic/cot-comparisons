I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store, on probation, and they're worried about getting fired after a write-up. The situation involves them taking a break and being approached by a customer asking for Cadbury Cream eggs. The customer hadn't checked the obvious area, so the cashier said they were on break and left. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, even though the cashier was on a break.\n\nFirst, the key points: The cashier was on a break as instructed by the manager. The customer approached them during that break. The cashier explained they were on break and walked away. The manager's response was to write them up for being rude and then for arguing when explaining their situation.\n\nNow, considering company policies. If the cashier was explicitly told to take a break, then they were following the manager's orders. However, maybe the policy is that employees should be available to assist customers even during breaks? But usually, breaks are for employees to rest, use the bathroom, etc., so they might not be expected to help customers during that time. The manager's reaction seems harsh, especially since the cashier was trying to take the break they were given. \n\nThe cashier's reasoning: They were on a break, needed to use the bathroom, and had previous experiences where simple questions led to longer interactions. So they didn't want to engage. But the customer was asking a straightforward question. Saying they were on break isn't rude if it's true. However, maybe the way they said it was abrupt, but the customer's accusation of rudeness might be a stretch if they just said they were on break and left.\n\nThe manager's decision to write up for being on break and for explaining their situation seems unfair. The cashier was following the manager's own instruction to take a break. The manager then penalized them for taking the break, which could be a poor management decision. Also, the third write-up threat is serious, but if the first two were valid, maybe the cashier did have prior issues. But in this specific case, the cashier was in a valid break when approached and followed the manager's directive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the cashier might not be in the wrong. The manager is enforcing policies inconsistently or unreasonably. The cashier's actions were within their rights if the break was approved. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
