I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is a cashier at a grocery store. They had a busy morning where they handled the rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, and then when they finally got a break, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude, and the cashier got another write-up for arguing.\n\nThe question is whether the cashier is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the cashier was given permission to take a 15-minute break by the manager. If they were on a break, then they might not be supposed to be helping customers. But the problem is that when the customer approached them during the break, the cashier said they were on break instead of helping. \n\nNow, work policies can vary, but in many retail environments, employees are allowed to take breaks, and during that time, they're not expected to help customers unless it's an emergency or the manager assigns them tasks. However, sometimes employers expect employees to be available for customer service even during breaks, especially if they're in a public area. \n\nIn this case, the cashier was on a break, but the customer approached them. The cashier's response was to state they were on break. That could be seen as polite, especially if they were actually on a scheduled break. However, if the employee was supposed to be on break in a specific area and instead was in the store where customers would expect help, that might be a policy violation. \n\nAlso, the cashier had been working without a break for a long time, which is understandable. They needed to use the bathroom, so maybe they were relieved to finally have a break. But when the customer approached, they might have been in a rush to get back to their break or needed to hurry to the bathroom. \n\nThe manager wrote them up for being rude, but the cashier was just stating they were on break. Was that rude? If the cashier was supposed to be available during their break, then maybe they were in the wrong. But if they had permission to take a break and were in the break room, then they might be justified. However, in this case, the cashier was walking through the store during the break, which might mean they were still in a public area where customers could approach them. \n\nAnother factor is the probationary period. The cashier is on probation, so they have to be careful with any write-ups. The manager might have been strict because of that. The cashier also mentioned that previous interactions with customers led to longer conversations, which is why they wanted to avoid it this time. But the customer's question was about finding a product, which is a common request. The cashier could have pointed the customer in the right direction without engaging in a long conversation, but instead chose to say they were on break. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the cashier was in the wrong if the policy required them to assist customers even during breaks unless they were in a designated break area. If they were in the store during a break, they might be expected to help. Alternatively, if the break was approved by the manager, the cashier might be justified. However, the manager's reaction was to write them up for being rude, which suggests that the company expects employees to assist customers regardless of their break status. \n\nBut also, the cashier had been working non-stop for several hours without a bathroom break, which is a legitimate concern. The manager's response to the cashier's explanation was not empathetic. The cashier might have felt pressured and just wanted to take their break. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a grey area. The cashier was on a break but in a public space. The manager might have strict policies, but the situation also shows that the cashier was overworked. However, the action of telling a customer they were on break instead of helping could be seen as unprofessional, hence the manager's write-up. So maybe the cashier is in the wrong (A) because they didn't help the customer despite being on a break in a public area, or not (B) because they were following their manager's instruction to take a break. \n\nBut given that the cashier was in the store during a break and the customer approached them, the company might expect employees to still assist. So the cashier might be at fault for not helping, even if they were on a break. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
