I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on a break, was approached by a customer asking a question, and told the customer they were on break. The manager wrote them up for being rude. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and expectations of the workplace. The author was told to take a break by their manager, so technically they were on break. But in a customer service role, especially one like a grocery store cashier, employees are often expected to assist customers even during breaks. However, the manager did tell them to take a break, which might imply they're allowed to step away.\n\nThe customer's question was about product location, which is a common query. The author might be correct that the product was nearby, but the customer might not have known. The key point here is whether employees are supposed to help customers even when on break. If the store policy allows employees to take breaks without assisting customers, then the author wasn't wrong. But if the policy expects employees to help during their shifts, even during breaks, then the author might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the manager's reaction seems harsh. The author was on a probationary period and had a good track record. The manager wrote them up for not answering a question, even though they were on break. The manager also wrote them up again for explaining instead of just accepting the reprimand. That could indicate that management's expectations are unclear or that they're being overly strict.\n\nAnother angle is the stress the author was under. They had to handle the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and then were told to take a break. The need to use the restroom is a basic human need. If the break was given by the manager, then the author should be able to use that time for personal needs. However, if part of the break is still being on call for customer assistance, that's an issue.\n\nI think the main factors are the workplace policy and the manager's expectations. If the manager told them to take a break, then the author was following instructions. If the policy states that employees must assist customers even during breaks, then the author might be at fault. But if the manager allowed the break, the author isn't in the wrong. The manager's double write-up for explaining seems punitive, which might indicate poor management rather than the employee's fault.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the author was following the manager's instruction to take a break, so they were not in the wrong for not answering the customer's question. The manager's strict enforcement and the second write-up for explaining, not arguing, could be the real issues here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
