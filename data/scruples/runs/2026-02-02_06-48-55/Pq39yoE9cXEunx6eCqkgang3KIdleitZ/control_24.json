I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a cashier who was on a break but got asked a question by a customer. The cashier told the customer they were on break instead of helping, and then got written up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. The cashier was told to take a 15-minute break by their manager. If taking a break means they're not supposed to help customers, then maybe they were following orders. But maybe the policy is that even during breaks, employees should help if approached. However, the cashier was also extremely busy, had been working without a break, and needed to use the bathroom. That's a physical necessity.\n\nThe customer's question was supposed to be simple, but the cashier might have been concerned about getting into longer conversations from past experiences. The manager wrote them up for not helping and for arguing when explaining their situation. \n\nNow, the key points here are: the cashier was on a scheduled break, had a valid need to take that break, and the manager's reaction seems harsh. The manager didn't consider the context of the cashier's need to take a break because they were overworked and had to use the restroom. \n\nBut in many workplaces, even during breaks, employees are expected to be available or at least polite. However, if the break was authorized by the manager, then the cashier was following protocol. The manager's strict adherence to \"customer is always right\" might be part of the policy, but the situation had extenuating circumstances. \n\nThe cashier might not be in the wrong because they were following their manager's instruction to take a break and had a legitimate need. However, the way they handled the customer's question could be seen as dismissive. Instead of explaining they were on a break, maybe they could have pointed the customer in the right direction quickly. But the problem is that the customer was right behind them where the product was, so maybe the cashier thought the customer wasn't looking properly. \n\nThe manager's reaction seems to not take into account the employee's situation, which might be a separate issue. But the question is whether the cashier was in the wrong. If the policy is that breaks are for rest and not customer service, then the cashier did the right thing. But if the policy is that employees should help customers even on breaks, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nGiven the information, the cashier was following the manager's instruction to take a break, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The manager's strictness without considering the employee's need to relieve themselves is part of the problem. So the answer might be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
