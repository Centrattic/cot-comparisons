I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling a morning rush alone after a coworker called in sick. Their manager was late, so they took a break around 9:45 AM. While on break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier was in a hurry to go to the bathroom and told the customer they were on break instead of answering. The manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the cashier was supposed to help customers during their break. Typically, when an employee is on a scheduled break, they're excused from work duties. However, in some workplaces, especially during busy times, employees might be expected to handle quick questions even on break. The cashier mentioned that their break was supposed to be 15 minutes, so maybe the manager expected them to be available for minor tasks even during that time.\n\nThe cashier's reasoning was that they needed to use the restroom badly and didn't want to engage in a longer conversation, which had happened before. They also mentioned that the product the customer was looking for was clearly visible nearby. However, refusing to answer any customer question, even briefly, could be seen as unprofessional, especially since the customer approached them. The manager's perspective is that the customer came first, and the cashier didn't handle it properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier was in a high-stress situation, handling the morning rush alone, and finally taking a break. The manager was the one who told them to take the break, so there's some responsibility there too. The cashier might feel they were set up if the manager expected them to work during their break. Additionally, the manager wrote them up for both being rude and for arguing when explaining their situation. That seems harsh, as explaining why you're on break isn't arguing.\n\nBut from a company policy standpoint, if the cashier is on break, their primary duty is to themselves. However, in retail, it's common to assist customers even during breaks, as breaks are often short and employees might be called back into action. The cashier's response of \"I'm on break\" might be seen as dismissive rather than helpful. Maybe they could have pointed the customer in the right direction quickly before going to the bathroom.\n\nIn summary, the cashier might be in the wrong for not helping the customer, even briefly, since the product was nearby. However, the manager's handling of the situation and the stress of the environment also play a role. The key is whether the company policy allows for employees to be on break without interruptions. If the policy states that breaks are strictly for rest and not for work, then the cashier wasn't wrong. But if the policy expects employees to be available during breaks, then the cashier was in the wrong. Since the manager wrote them up for being rude, it's likely the company expects assistance even during breaks, making the cashier at fault. But there's a bit of ambiguity here. Considering all factors, I lean towards the cashier being in the wrong, but there are mitigating circumstances. Still, the decision to not answer a simple question when on break might not align with company expectations, so the answer is A.\n"
