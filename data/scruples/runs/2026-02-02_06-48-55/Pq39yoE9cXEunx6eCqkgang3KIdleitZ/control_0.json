I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the cashier was on a break and a customer asked a question. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude and also for arguing when they explained their side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. If the manager told the cashier to take a 15-minute break, then technically the cashier was supposed to be on break. If being on break means they're not supposed to engage with customers, then maybe they were right to avoid the interaction. But if the policy is that even on break, employees should assist customers if approached, then the cashier might be in the wrong.\n\nNext, the cashier's reasoning. They were stressed because they hadn't used the bathroom and were worried about the previous write-up. They felt that customers often ask more than one question or get into long conversations, so they wanted to avoid that. But the manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and the cashier was rude by not helping. \n\nAlso, the manager wrote them up for arguing when they tried to explain. The cashier felt they were explaining, not arguing. Maybe there was a communication issue here. The manager might have expected a different response, like being polite but firm about being on break.\n\nAnother angle: the probationary period. If the employee is on probation, they might be held to higher standards. Even if they were on break, perhaps the manager expected them to still assist customers, considering the role of a cashier in a grocery store. But if the break is supposed to be a time to step away, maybe the manager should have considered that.\n\nThe customer interaction: the cashier thought the customer wasn't looking and the answer was obvious, so they didn't want to get into a long conversation. However, even if the answer is obvious, refusing to help could be seen as unprofessional. But the cashier was on a break, so maybe that's a valid reason.\n\nIn some workplaces, especially retail, there's an expectation that employees should assist customers even during breaks unless explicitly told otherwise. But in this case, the manager had instructed the cashier to take a break. If the break is supposed to be a time to rest, then the cashier might be justified in not engaging. However, the manager might see it as the cashier avoiding responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are the store's policies on breaks, how customers are supposed to be handled during breaks, and the manager's expectations. If the cashier was on a break as instructed, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the manager's policy is that employees must assist customers regardless of being on break, then the cashier was in the wrong for not helping.\n\nAlso, the fact that the cashier had a history of issues (probation and a previous write-up) adds pressure. The manager might have been more strict, but the cashier's actions were in line with being on a break. However, the cashier could have handled the situation better by being polite and explaining they were on break, even if they were in a hurry.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a grey area. The cashier was on a break as instructed, which is valid, but the manager's strict policy might mean the cashier was in the wrong for not assisting. However, the manager's reaction to the explanation as arguing might also be an issue. But according to the question, we have to decide if the author is in the wrong. Considering standard workplace expectations, employees are often expected to assist customers even during breaks unless told otherwise. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't help the customer, but if the break was explicitly allowed, maybe B. Hmm. Need to check if the manager told them to take a break, so being on break is allowed, but maybe the cashier should still be polite and direct the customer. So maybe B (Not in the wrong) if they were following the manager's instruction to take a break and the manager didn't specify they should help during breaks. However, the manager's reaction is important. The cashier was on break, so perhaps they were correct in not engaging, making the answer B. But the manager might have different expectations. It's complicated. Maybe the answer is B because the cashier was following the manager's instruction to take a break, so they were justified in not helping.\n"
