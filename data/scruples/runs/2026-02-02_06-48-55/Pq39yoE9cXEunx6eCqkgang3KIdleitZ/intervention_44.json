I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a cashier being written up for telling a customer they were on a break instead of answering a question.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The cashier was handling a rush, hadn't taken a break yet, and when a customer asked a question, they said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier argues that past experiences made them avoid long conversations, especially with needing to use the bathroom.\n\nHmm. The key points here are company policy on breaks and customer service expectations. If the cashier was supposed to take a break only after finishing their shift or after being relieved, maybe they weren't actually on break yet. But the manager told them to take the break. So the cashier was following the manager's instruction. But then, when approached by a customer, they said they were on break. Maybe the customer approached them while they were still on the floor, not in the break room. \n\nIn most workplaces, even if you're on a break, you might still need to handle customer inquiries unless you're officially off the clock. If the cashier was in a public area during their break, maybe they should have directed the customer to another staff member or at least tried to help briefly. However, the cashier's reason was needing to use the bathroom urgently, which is a valid physical need. But the manager's response was strict, writing them up for arguing. \n\nThe cashier's past experiences might influence their reaction. If previous customers turned simple questions into lengthy interactions, they might have been trying to avoid that. But is it reasonable to say they were on break when they weren't supposed to be? If the manager had just told them to take a break, maybe they were allowed to step away. But the timing and location matter here. \n\nWorkplace policies vary, but generally, when on a break, employees are not supposed to be on the floor unless required. If the cashier was on a break and not in the break room, that could be a policy violation. However, if the manager told them to take a break, maybe they were allowed to step out. \n\nThe cashier's main argument is that they needed to take a break immediately and couldn't handle the question. The manager's response was harsh, but the cashier's action might still be against company policy. So maybe the cashier is in the wrong for not handling the customer's request and cutting off the interaction, even if they were on a break. Alternatively, if the cashier was allowed to be on break, maybe the manager overreacted. \n\nBut the cashier was on a probationary period with a union, so the manager might be strict. The cashier's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is valid, but if the manager didn't accept that, it's a problem. However, from the company's perspective, the cashier should have handled the situation professionally, even if they needed a break. \n\nSo, the cashier might be in the wrong for not following proper procedure. Instead of saying they were on break, they could have asked the customer to wait or directed them to another cashier. The customer's question was simple, and the cashier's response was dismissive. Even if they were on a break, the way they handled it was unprofessional, leading to the write-up. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
