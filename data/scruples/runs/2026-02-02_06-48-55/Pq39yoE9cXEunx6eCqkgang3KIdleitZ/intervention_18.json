I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a cashier at a grocery store, on a probationary period. They got written up for being rude when a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing.\n\nFirst, the employee was on break, as instructed by the manager. The customer approached them during that break. But the customer might not know the employee is on break unless it's clearly communicated. The employee's duty is to the job, but breaks are supposed to be a time to rest. However, the policy might require employees to be available even during breaks if needed. \n\nThe situation is tricky. The employee was on break, but the customer might not be aware of that. The employee's action of walking away could be seen as rude, especially if the customer didn't know they were on break. The employee's reason was that they had to use the bathroom and wanted to avoid long conversations, but their job also requires assisting customers. \n\nThe manager's response seems strict. Writing up for being on a break and then again for explaining might be harsh. But the employee might have violated the store's policy by not assisting the customer, even if they were on break. \n\nThe key points are: was the employee allowed to be on break when approached by the customer? If the break was a paid break, they have the right to be on it. If the break was a time when they should still be available, then maybe they should have helped. Also, how was the break communicated to customers? If the employee was supposed to be visible but on break, the customer might not know. The employee's explanation about needing to use the bathroom is valid as a human need, but the way they handled the interaction could be seen as unprofessional. \n\nIn many workplaces, employees are allowed to be on breaks, but they should still be courteous. The employee could have directed the customer to help themselves (like pointing to a map or another employee) instead of just saying they were on break. The manager's policy of \"customer is always right\" is strict, but maybe the employee's actions weren't in line with company policy. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the employee might be at fault for not handling the customer's question properly while on break, even if the break was necessary. The manager's write-ups might be justified based on company policy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
