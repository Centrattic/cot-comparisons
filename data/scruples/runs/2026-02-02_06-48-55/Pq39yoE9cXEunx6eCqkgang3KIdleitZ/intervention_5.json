I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. They worked as a cashier at a grocery store and were told by their manager to take a break after handling the morning rush alone. While on break, a customer asked about Cadbury Cream eggs, and the cashier mentioned they were on break and left. The manager wrote them up for being rude, even though they were supposed to be on break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. The cashier was told to take a 15-minute break, so they were technically supposed to be away from their register. However, customers might not be aware of internal schedules. If the cashier was in the breakroom, it's clear they're not working, but if they were walking in the store during a break, a customer might approach them and expect help. The cashier's job likely requires assisting customers, even if they're not at their register. But if they were explicitly on a break, maybe they can't be interrupted. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were desperate to use the bathroom and wanted to avoid long conversations. But even so, the customer might not know they're on break. The cashier could have politely redirected the customer to a staff member or helped them quickly and then returned to their break. The manager's perspective is that the customer came first, hence \"the customer is always right.\" However, the cashier was following the manager's instructions to take a break. \n\nThere's a conflict here between employee well-being (taking breaks) and customer service. The manager might have expected the cashier to handle the customer despite being on break, even if it was a short interruption. The cashier didn't explain they were on a break; they just said they were and walked away. That could come off as abrupt or rude. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier was in a vulnerable state (needing to use the bathroom) and might have been stressed. They had a valid reason to want to take the break seriously. The manager's reaction seems harsh if the cashier was doing their part by taking the break but in the store area where they could be approached. \n\nBut according to typical work policies, even during a break, employees might be expected to be available for customer assistance. If the cashier was in the store, they might be seen as still on duty in a way, even if they're not at their register. So the cashier might have been wrong to dismiss the customer instead of helping or referring them to another employee. \n\nHowever, the manager's instruction was to take a 15-minute break, implying they should be away from the floor. If the cashier was told to go to the breakroom, then the manager might have been at fault for not ensuring coverage during the break. But the cashier didn't mention being in the breakroom when the customer approached. \n\nIn the end, the cashier's response could be seen as unprofessional if they didn't handle the customer's request politely. Even if they were on a break, the customer might not know that, so the cashier should have been courteous. The manager's write-up is a bit strict, but the cashier might have been in the wrong for not addressing the customer properly.\n"
