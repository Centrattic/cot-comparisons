I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on break, was approached by a customer asking a question, and told the customer they were on break instead of helping. The manager then wrote them up for being rude. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the rules of the workplace. If the manager told them to take a break, then being on break is allowed. However, if the policy is that employees must be available to assist customers even during breaks, that's a different story. The cashier's job is to serve customers, so walking away might be against company policy.\n\nBut the cashier was on a break, right? So maybe they were allowed to step away. However, if the break is supposed to be for rest and not for avoiding customer interactions, the manager might still hold them accountable. The cashier explained they were on break, which is their right, but the manager's response seems harsh. \n\nAlso, the cashier had been working without a break for several hours, which could be against labor laws depending on the location. If they were entitled to a break and the manager finally allowed it, then taking that break is justified. The customer wasn't in distress, just asking for a product that was clearly visible. \n\nThe manager wrote them up for two reasons: not helping the customer and then arguing when explaining they were on break. The cashier was explaining, not arguing. The manager's decision to write them up for being on break and not helping might be unfair, especially if the company policy allows breaks. \n\nIn conclusion, the cashier was following the manager's order to take a break, so telling the customer they were on break should be acceptable. The manager's overreaction might be the issue here. So the cashier isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
