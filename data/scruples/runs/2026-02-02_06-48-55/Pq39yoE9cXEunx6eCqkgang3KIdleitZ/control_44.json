I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get to use the bathroom, then their manager told them to take a 15-minute break. While on the break, a customer asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The author was in the middle of their break and told the customer they were on break instead of answering. Then the manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. If the manager told them to take a break, then during that break, they might not be expected to help customers. But maybe the break is a paid break, and they're supposed to still assist customers even on break? Or maybe breaks are considered time off, so they don't have to work during that time. The key here is whether the author was supposed to be available to help customers during their break. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they had to go to the bathroom really badly. That adds context about their stress level. However, if they were given a break, they should have used that time to address personal needs, like using the bathroom, instead of trying to do both during a rush. But maybe the break was just to take a short rest, not a long time to go to the bathroom. \n\nThe manager's reaction seems harsh because they gave the break, and then the customer approached the author. If the manager said to take a break, then the author might not be in the wrong for being on break. However, sometimes in retail, even on a break, employees are expected to help customers if possible. So there's a conflict here between the manager's instruction and the customer service expectation.\n\nAnother angle is the probationary period. The author is on probation, so they might be more sensitive to write-ups. The manager might be enforcing strict policies here. But if the manager told them to take a break, then punishing them for being on break seems contradictory. \n\nThe customer's question was simple, but the author had a history of customers asking more than just one question. Maybe that history influenced their decision to not engage. However, if they were on break, then they are allowed to not answer. But if breaks are still part of their work time where they need to be available, then they are in the wrong.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the manager gave them a break, so the author was following instructions. On the other hand, customers expect help from anyone in a store, even if they're on a break. The manager might have different policies. The key issue is whether the store's policy allows employees to be unreachable during their break. If the break is a \"mandatory break\" where they need to step away from work duties entirely, then the author is not in the wrong. If the break is just a short rest period where they can still help, then they are in the wrong. Since the manager told them to take the break, it seems like the intention was for them to rest, so the author might not be at fault. But the manager's reaction complicates things. \n\nIn terms of the customer's perspective, they might feel ignored if an employee is available but says they're on break. However, the customer didn't know the author was on a break. So maybe the author should have directed the customer to another cashier or to the manager. But since there were no other cashiers (the original cashier was sick), maybe the author was the only one available. But if the manager assigned them a break, then they should have asked the customer to wait or asked for assistance from another employee if possible.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author might not be in the wrong if the break was given by the manager. The manager's policy might have conflicting expectations. The write-up for being on a break when told to take one seems harsh. However, maybe the store's policy states that even on break, employees must assist customers. Without knowing the exact policy, it's hard to say. But based on the manager's instruction, the author was following orders, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
