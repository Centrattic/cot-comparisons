I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were given a 15-minute break after working a tough morning shift, including handling the morning rush and not going to the bathroom. During their break, a customer approached and asked where the Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier told the customer they were on break and walked away. The manager later wrote them up for being rude and argued with them.\n\nFirst, the key points: the employee was on a break, the manager told them to take it. The customer approached during that time. The question is whether the employee was in the wrong for not helping the customer while on break.\n\nFrom the employee's side, they were given explicit permission to take a break by their manager. Break times are usually considered non-working time unless an emergency arises. The customer's question seems straightforward, but the employee felt pressured due to past experiences where simple questions led to longer interactions. They were physically uncomfortable (needing to use the bathroom) and wanted to avoid another time-consuming conversation.\n\nThe manager's stance is that the customer should always be right, and the employee was rude. However, the employee was following the manager's own instruction to take a break. If the policy allows breaks, then the employee was within their rights. The manager's decision to write them up for being on a break seems contradictory. Additionally, the manager then wrote up the employee again for arguing when they were just explaining their situation.\n\nThe union's role might be a factor. The employee mentions they have a union, which could offer protection against unjust write-ups. The probationary period is a point too; sometimes policies can be more flexible during probation, but unfair treatment can still occur.\n\nIn retail, employees are typically expected to be available to assist customers. However, if the employee was on a scheduled break, they aren't obligated to help. The manager's late relief and the employee's need to take a break were part of the manager's responsibility. The customer might not have known the employee was on a break, leading to the interaction. The employee's choice to prioritize their break, which was sanctioned by the manager, could be justified. The manager's handling of the situation seems harsh, especially with two write-ups in a short time due to understandable stress.\n\nBut the employee didn't mention the break to the customer politely. Telling someone they're on a break and walking away could be seen as rude. Maybe there was a middle ground, like directing the customer to another cashier or a sign. However, considering the break was given by the manager, the employee's actions were within policy.\n\nSo, the answer is more about management's poor handling and lack of support, rather than the employee being at fault.\n"
