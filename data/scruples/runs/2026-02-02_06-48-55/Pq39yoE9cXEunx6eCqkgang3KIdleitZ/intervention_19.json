I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and then a customer approached them during their break. The manager told them to take a 15-minute break, so they went to the break room. But when walking to the break room, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream Eggs were. The user responded they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the user was on break as instructed by the manager. The customer approached them in the store, not at their workstation. The user was in the process of taking their break. The customer's question might seem simple, but the user had a history of customers asking multiple questions. They were in a hurry to use the bathroom, which is understandable. However, responding to the customer while on break could be against company policy. The manager's main point was about being rude, but the user was on break, so maybe they shouldn't have been approached in the store. The user's response of being on break might not be the best way to handle it. They could have directed the customer to ask someone else or explained they were on break more politely. The manager's reaction seems harsh, but the user's response might not have been appropriate either. The user did explain their situation but the manager didn't accept it. So, depending on the company's policy about being on break and interacting with customers, the user might be at fault. If employees are supposed to be off-duty during breaks, then answering a customer's question could be a policy violation. Alternatively, if the break is just a rest period, maybe they're allowed to be in the store but not answer questions. The user's frustration is valid, but their response might have been too abrupt. So maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong), but with understanding.\n"
