I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a cashier at a grocery store during their probation period. They were handling the morning rush alone because another cashier called in sick. They didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom and finally took a break when their manager told them to. Then, a customer approached them and asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude, not caring about the customer's question, and later for arguing when they tried to explain their situation.\n\nFirst, the cashier was on break, which the manager had just assigned. So technically, they were allowed to take a break. But the customer approached them while they were on break. The problem here is whether the cashier should have helped the customer even during their break. In many workplaces, especially retail, employees are expected to be available to assist customers even during breaks if they're on the premises. So maybe the cashier was in the wrong by not helping the customer when they were in the store, even if they were on a break.\n\nAlso, the cashier mentioned that in the past, simple questions turned into longer conversations, and they didn't want to get into that. But the situation here was the customer directly asking for product information, which is a basic part of the job. Even if they were on break, perhaps they should have at least pointed the customer in the right direction instead of refusing.\n\nThe manager's reaction was harsh, giving a write-up for being rude and then another for arguing. The cashier was in a stressful situation, handling a busy morning alone, and needed to take a bathroom break. However, the way they handled the customer's question might not have been appropriate. Instead of walking away after saying they were on break, maybe they could have politely informed the customer and then gone to the bathroom quickly.\n\nAdditionally, the manager's response of writing up for arguing when the cashier was explaining their situation could be an issue. The manager might not have considered the cashier's need for a break and the stress of the situation. But the initial action of the cashier in refusing to help a customer on the floor during a break might still be seen as against company policy.\n\nIn some stores, breaks are supposed to be taken in a designated area, not roaming the premises. If the cashier was on break and out in the store, maybe the manager had a right to correct that. However, the customer's question is a service issue. The cashier's responsibility is to assist customers whenever they are on company premises, even on break, unless instructed otherwise.\n\nSo considering all this, the cashier might be in the wrong for not helping the customer when they were in the store, even if they were on a break. However, the manager's handling of the situation, especially the second write-up for arguing, could be excessive. But the initial act of refusing to help the customer is likely against company expectations, making the cashier at least partially at fault.\n"
