I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is the asshole (AITA) for telling a customer they were on break instead of answering her question. The story is a bit detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The employee is a cashier at a grocery store, on probation, and has already been written up. They were handling the morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break, and finally got a 15-minute break from their manager. While on break, a customer stops them to ask about Cadbury Cream Eggs. The employee tells the customer they're on break and walks away. The manager then writes them up for being rude, and the employee argues but gets another write-up for arguing.\n\nSo the key points here are: the employee was on break, the customer wasn't looking for the product (since there were obvious signs), and the employee's reason for not engaging was needing a bathroom break and past experiences where similar questions led to long conversations.\n\nFrom a workplace policy standpoint, if the employee was on a break, they're not supposed to be assisting customers. But timing is important. If the manager told them to take a break after the morning rush, maybe that's when they were supposed to take it. However, the employee might have been on a scheduled break, so they had the right to be on break. \n\nBut the manager's reaction is harsh. Writing up an employee for being on break could be an issue. The manager's reasoning is \"the customer is always right,\" but the customer was asking a simple question. However, the employee was on break, so perhaps they were within their rights. \n\nThe employee's argument about needing a bathroom break and past experiences where customers asked long questions might be valid stress factors. But in a retail job, customers can approach employees anywhere, not just at the register. So the employee's response of refusing to help might come off as rude, even if they were on break. \n\nBut if the employee was explicitly told to take a break and were going to the break room, maybe they were supposed to avoid customer interactions. However, in practice, employees might still be expected to assist if approached, unless it's a scheduled break. \n\nThe manager's write-up seems strict. The employee explaining their situation shouldn't be considered arguing. The manager's response seems harsh, especially since the employee was on a break and the customer's question was simple. \n\nSo, is the employee in the wrong? If they were on an unpaid break (like a smoke break), they might be expected to assist. But if it's a scheduled break, they're supposed to step away from work duties. The manager might have a policy that breaks are for specific purposes, but the employee's reason for needing to take the break (bathroom and stress) is valid. \n\nIn terms of customer service, employees are generally expected to be helpful. However, if the employee was on a break, they might not be expected to help. The manager's reaction seems excessive. \n\nI think the manager is overstepping by writing up the employee for being on break. The employee's actions were within their break time, and the manager's \"customer is always right\" policy is too strict here. So the answer would be B (not the asshole) because the employee was on a break and the manager's handling was unfair. But there's a gray area because sometimes employees are expected to assist even during breaks, depending on the company policy.\n"
