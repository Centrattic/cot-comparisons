I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story was in the wrong when they told a customer they were on break instead of answering her question. \n\nFirst, the context: the cashier was handling a morning rush alone, didn't get a bathroom break until their manager told them to take one. Then, a customer approached while they were on break. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager wrote them up because the customer felt they were rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are the company's policies on breaks and customer service. Generally, when employees are on break, especially if it's a scheduled break, they might not be expected to assist customers. But if the break was given by the manager, maybe there's a protocol about being available or not. \n\nThe cashier mentions they had to use the bathroom, which is a basic need. However, if they were told to take a break, they might be supposed to follow the break rules, which could include not engaging with customers. But if they were supposed to be available during breaks, then the cashier's action could be seen as a violation. \n\nAlso, the manager's reaction is important. The cashier was already on probation and had prior write-ups. The manager might have strict policies, emphasizing \"customer is always right.\" Even if the employee felt the situation was urgent, the manager's authority to enforce rules is key here. \n\nThe customer's perspective: she asked a question and the employee didn't help. From her side, that's poor service. The employee might have been justified in being on break, but the way they handled it\u2014walking away without offering help\u2014could be seen as rude. Maybe they should have directed the customer to another staff member or the customer service desk instead of refusing.\n\nIn terms of union rules, sometimes there are guidelines about breaks and what employees can and can't do. If the union has protocols that protect employees from being forced to work during breaks, that might support the cashier. But if the union's rules require employees to be available during certain breaks, then the cashier is in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the cashier's previous experiences where questions led to long conversations might have made them wary, but that doesn't excuse not helping in this case. The manager's priority is customer service, and the cashier's action might have violated that.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the cashier might be at fault for not following the manager's instructions properly and for not assisting a customer when on break, depending on company policy. However, the manager's strictness and the employee's need to take a bathroom break add complexity. But the manager likely has the authority to enforce policies regardless of the employee's personal needs.\n"
