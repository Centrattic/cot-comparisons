I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a cashier at a grocery store on probation. They were told to take a 15-minute break by their manager. While on their break, a customer asked where Cadbury Cream Eggs were, which the cashier considered a simple question. However, the cashier responded by saying they were on break and left. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the cashier was on a break. Typically, breaks are for employees to rest, use the restroom, etc. But the key here is whether they were supposed to be available for customer questions during their break. If the manager said \"take a break,\" maybe they're allowed to step away from work tasks. However, the customer might not know that the employee is on a break. So, when approached, the cashier's duty is to assist unless they're not supposed to be working. \n\nThe cashier's reasoning is that they had to use the bathroom and wanted to avoid long conversations. But even if they need to use the bathroom, if they're still on break, maybe they should be available for customer assistance since the break is a work break. However, in many workplaces, breaks are considered personal time, and employees aren't expected to work during that time. So if the cashier was on a scheduled break, they aren't at fault for not helping. \n\nThe manager wrote them up for being rude. The cashier said they were on break, which is a legitimate reason. But maybe the manager's policy is that employees must be available to help customers even during breaks, depending on the store's policy. However, if the manager told the cashier to take a break, the cashier might be following the manager's instruction by taking the break, thus not being available for customer service. \n\nThe cashier did explain they were on break, which is the correct approach. If the manager insists that they should help even during breaks, then the manager's policy is strict, but the cashier followed the initial instruction. \n\nThe question is whether the cashier was in the wrong. If the store policy allows breaks where employees can step away, then the cashier is not in the wrong. If the store expects employees to be available for customers even during breaks, then the cashier might be in the wrong. But the manager told them to take a break, so the cashier's action aligns with the manager's instruction. The manager then contradicted himself by writing up the cashier for being on break. \n\nAlso, the cashier had to use the bathroom, which is a basic need. If the manager told them to take a break to address that, then it's reasonable. However, the customer might have approached during the break, and the cashier's response was appropriate by stating they were on break. \n\nSo, considering the manager's instruction to take a break and the cashier following that, the cashier is not in the wrong. The manager's policy seems inconsistent. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
