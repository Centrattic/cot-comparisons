I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a cashier at a grocery store on probation, and they were written up for being rude when a customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The author says they were on a break and didn't want to engage in a conversation because they had an urge to go to the bathroom. Their manager wrote them up, and now they're worried about being fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the workplace. If the author was actually on a break when the customer approached them, then maybe they were in the break area and not supposed to be assisting customers. But the description says they were walking through the store when the customer approached. If breaks are supposed to be taken in the break room and not roaming the store, then maybe they were in the wrong place during their break. If they were on a break and outside the break room, the manager might see that as not following break policies, which could contribute to the issue.\n\nNext, how did the author respond to the customer? They told the customer they were on break and walked away. The customer might have expected assistance, and the author's response could be seen as rude, even if they were on a break. The customer isn't aware of the employee's break schedule, so from their perspective, the employee was refusing help. The manager probably enforces the policy that employees should be helpful and polite, regardless of their current tasks. So, even if the employee was on a break, if they're still in the store, they might be expected to assist customers unless they're in a designated break area.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they were dealing with a previous customer interaction where a simple question turned into a longer conversation. But in this case, the customer's question was straightforward. The author could have pointed to the obvious location (since there were Cadbury eggs behind them) and then excused themselves. However, the author didn't do that; they just said they were on break and walked away. That lack of helpfulness might be why the manager considered it rude.\n\nAnother point is the probationary period. The author is on probation and has already been written up before, so the manager might be more strict. The manager's response was immediate, writing them up for arguing when they explained their situation. The manager's perspective is that the policy is \"customer is always right,\" which might mean that employee's personal circumstances don't matter in that moment. The manager might believe that the employee should handle the situation professionally, even during a break, if they're still in the store.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the employee's well-being. If they hadn't been to the bathroom since 5:30 AM and had a long shift, that's a valid concern. However, workplace policies might prioritize customer service over personal needs, especially in a unionized environment where rules are strict.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the employee was on a break but in the store, didn't assist a customer even though the question was simple, and the manager enforced the policy strictly. The employee might be in the wrong because they didn't follow the expected behavior during a break and didn't handle the customer's request appropriately.\n"
