I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the cashier was on break and told a customer that, instead of answering a question about where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The manager wrote them up for being rude, and the employee got another write-up for arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the company policy. Usually, when an employee is on a break, they're supposed to step away from work duties. If the manager told them to take a break, then the employee was following orders. However, sometimes there might be an expectation that even on break, employees should assist customers if possible, depending on the store's culture or policy. But the key here is that the manager told the employee to take a break, so maybe the employee was within their rights to say they were on break.\n\nThen there's the part about the customer not looking for the product. The employee mentions the display was obvious, so maybe the customer wasn't trying. But the employee's job is to help regardless of the customer's effort. However, if the employee was on a break, maybe they weren't supposed to help.\n\nThe employee was stressed, had been working without a break, and needed to use the bathroom. That's a valid concern. But the manager said they could take a break, so the employee should have stepped away from the floor immediately. If the customer approached during the break, the employee might not be obligated to help, but maybe the way they responded was abrupt.\n\nThe manager's reaction to the write-up: the employee explained they were on break, but the manager emphasized customer service. Maybe the policy is that even on break, employees should assist unless they're in a private area. If the employee was walking through the store during their break and got approached, they might still be expected to help. But if they're supposed to be out of the customer's view during a break, then maybe not.\n\nAlso, the employee argued with the manager, leading to another write-up. Arguing can be a policy violation regardless of the situation. So even if the employee was right about being on break, the argument might have been the main issue here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the employee was on a break as instructed, but when a customer approached, they chose to say they were on break instead of helping. The manager might see this as not following customer service standards. However, the employee was following the manager's order to take a break. The argument could have been handled better. The key is whether the policy allows employees to be on break and not assist customers. If the policy is that breaks are for personal time and not for customer interaction, then the employee was right. If the policy is that employees should be available to help even on break, then they were wrong.\n\nBut since the manager told them to take a break, maybe it's expected that they step away completely. However, if the break is just a 15-minute break and they're still in the store, maybe they can't avoid customers. The employee's response was to walk away, which might be seen as rude. So maybe the employee was in the wrong for not helping, but the manager's handling of the situation was harsh. However, the main issue is whether the employee violated a policy by not assisting a customer while on break. If the policy allows breaks without customer interaction, then the manager's write-up is unfair. If not, then the employee is at fault.\n\nAlso, the employee was under stress and had a valid reason to need a break, but that doesn't excuse not following the policy. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) if the policy requires assisting customers even on break, or B (not in the wrong) if the policy allows breaks without help. Since the manager said they were on break, but still expected them to help, maybe the policy is unclear, but the employee should follow the manager's instruction to take a break, thus not being in the wrong. However, the way the employee responded (just walking away) might be considered rude regardless of the break. So maybe it's a mix, but the main point is the employee was on a break as instructed, so not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
