I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a cashier on probation, and they were given a break by their manager. While on break, a customer approached them and asked a question. The cashier said they were on break and walked away. The manager then wrote them up for being rude.\n\nFirst, the rules at the workplace: if the manager told them to take a break, then during that break, the employee is technically off-duty. However, sometimes there's an expectation that employees should still be available to customers even during breaks, depending on the store's policy. The employee might not have known if being on break meant they couldn't help customers. \n\nThe customer's question was simple, but the employee felt pressured from past experiences where similar questions led to longer conversations. Also, the employee was in a physical need to use the bathroom. \n\nThe manager's reaction is strict: \"customer is always right\" is a policy that some stores enforce, which could lead to writing up employees even if they're on break. But if the break was authorized by the manager, maybe the employee was following correct procedure.\n\nSo, was the employee wrong? If the policy allows employees to be on break and not assist customers, then they're in the right. But if the policy expects employees to be available during breaks, then they're in the wrong. Since the employee was told by the manager to take a break, maybe the manager's fault is not clarifying the expectations. However, the employee could have been more polite in refusing, like directing the customer to another staff member instead of just walking away. \n\nBut the situation is that they were on break, and the manager had just told them to take it. The employee might not be at fault for following the manager's instruction. However, maybe the way they handled the customer's question was abrupt. \n\nConsidering the circumstances, the employee might not be entirely in the wrong. The manager's strict policy and failure to consider the employee's need could also be an issue. So the answer might be B (not wrong), but it's a bit of a gray area. However, the employee did cut the customer off without offering help, which could be seen as rude. So maybe A is the answer. Hmm, this is tricky.\n"
