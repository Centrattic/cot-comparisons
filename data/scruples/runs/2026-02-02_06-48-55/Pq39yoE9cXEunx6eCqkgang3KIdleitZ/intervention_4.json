I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. They provided a detailed story where a cashier, who's on probation, was asked a question by a customer while they were on a scheduled break. The cashier apologized and walked away, but the manager wrote them up for being rude and then again for arguing when they explained their situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and expectations of the job. The cashier was told by the manager to take a 15-minute break. So, technically, they were on break when the customer approached. The question is whether employees are expected to assist customers during their breaks. In many retail jobs, even on break, you might still be expected to help if a customer approaches, unless the break is strictly enforced. But the cashier's manager did tell them to take a break, so maybe it's okay to step away. However, the cashier chose to go through the store, which is part of the work area, and might be within the store's policy that employees are still visible and should assist if needed.\n\nThe customer asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were, which the cashier thought was a simple question. But the cashier was in a rush to use the bathroom, which is a valid personal need. The problem is that the cashier didn't direct the customer or offer help, just said they were on break. The manager's perspective is that the customer is always right, and not helping could lead to complaints. But the cashier's reasoning is that they were on a break and had a legitimate reason to step away. However, the way the cashier handled it might be the issue. Maybe they should have politely directed the customer to another employee or a sign, rather than just walking away. \n\nAlso, the cashier was on probation, which means they're under closer scrutiny. Maybe the manager is strict, and even a minor infraction like not assisting a customer during a break could lead to write-ups. The cashier's argument about not wanting a long conversation is understandable, but in a job where customer service is key, any question might need to be addressed quickly, even if it's a break time. The manager might have expected the cashier to still be available for quick assistance during their break, especially if they're in a visible area of the store.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier was instructed to take a break, so they might have the right to step away. The manager's responsibility could be to ensure that customers are covered even when breaks are taken. But if the cashier was the only one working during the morning rush, maybe the manager should have handled it differently. However, the cashier's immediate action was to tell the customer they were on break, which could be seen as unprofessional or not following protocol.\n\nIn terms of union rules, if the cashier is unionized, there might be specific policies about breaks and customer interactions. The cashier might need to check their employment contract or union guidelines to see if refusing to help during a break is a violation. But the manager's reaction seems harsh, combining two write-ups for a single incident. The cashier was trying to explain their situation, which the manager took as arguing. That could indicate that the manager's approach is hostile, but the initial action of the cashier still might be at fault.\n\nThe key points here are: the cashier was on a break as per manager's instruction, the customer was in the store, and the cashier didn't assist. Depending on company policy, being on break might not be an excuse to ignore customer questions if they're in the work area. The cashier could have been expected to handle the query quickly, even during a break. Alternatively, if the break was meant to be away from the floor, maybe the cashier should have been in a different area. But since the cashier was in the store, perhaps they should have offered to help or pointed the customer in the right direction. \n\nSo, while the cashier's personal needs are valid, the way they handled the customer's question might not align with their job responsibilities, even during a break. Therefore, the cashier might be in the wrong for not assisting a customer when they were on break but still in the store, leading to the write-up. The manager's reaction seems excessive, but if the policy is that employees must assist customers during their time in the store, then the cashier's refusal is an issue. Considering that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
