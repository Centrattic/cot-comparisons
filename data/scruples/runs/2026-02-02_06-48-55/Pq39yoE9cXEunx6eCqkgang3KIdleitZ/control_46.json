I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a cashier who was told they were on break but got written up for not answering a customer's question. \n\nFirst, the context: The cashier was handling the morning rush alone because a coworker was sick. They didn't get to use the restroom and finally got a 15-minute break from their manager. While on break, a customer approached and asked where Cadbury Cream eggs were. The cashier told them they were on break and walked away. Then the manager wrote them up for being rude.\n\nNow, the key points. The cashier was on break, as instructed by the manager. If the customer approached them while they were on break, which they had just been told to take, then the cashier might not be at fault. However, maybe there's a policy that employees should assist customers even during breaks if they're in the store? Or maybe the cashier was still in a work area and expected to help. \n\nThe author mentions that they had a history of customers asking one question that turns into a longer interaction. They were desperate to use the restroom, so they didn't want to engage. But the manager said the customer is always right, so the cashier should have helped regardless. \n\nWorkplace policies often require employees to be helpful even during breaks if they're in the premises. If the cashier was on a break, maybe they should have directed the customer to someone else or used a customer service phone. But if they just left the customer without any help and said they were on break, that might be seen as unprofessional. \n\nAlso, the manager gave the break, so if the cashier was on break at that moment, the manager might have expected them to still assist. However, if the cashier was explicitly told to take a break, then maybe they were allowed to step away. \n\nThe cashier was written up for being rude and then again for arguing. The manager's reaction suggests they expected the cashier to help the customer regardless of the break. So from the company's perspective, the cashier might be in the wrong because they didn't follow the customer service standards, even during a break. \n\nBut another angle: If the cashier was on a scheduled break, they might not be expected to help. However, if they were told to take a break but still need to be available, like in a customer-facing role, then the cashier's action could be seen as not following protocol. \n\nIn some workplaces, breaks are strict, and employees can step away. But in others, especially retail, employees might be expected to help even during breaks if they're in the store. The answer might depend on the specific store's policies, which aren't detailed here. \n\nGiven the information, the manager's reaction indicates that the cashier was expected to assist the customer. The cashier's excuse about needing to use the bathroom might be valid, but if the company's policy is that the customer is always right, then the cashier might be in the wrong for not helping. However, the manager also wrote them up for arguing when they were just explaining their situation, which could indicate a harsh reaction. \n\nSo, the cashier's action might be against company policy, but the manager's handling could also be part of the problem. However, based on the given scenario, the cashier was told to take a break, but the manager expected them to still assist, leading to the write-up. Therefore, the cashier might be in the wrong for not following the implicit expectation to help customers even during a break.\n"
